Review,Senti
These stickers work like the review says they do. They stick on great and they stay on the phone. They are super stylish and I can share them with my sister. :),positive
These are awesome and make my phone look so stylish! I have only used one so far and have had it on for almost a year! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT! ONE YEAR!! Great quality!,positive
"Item arrived in great time and was in perfect condition. However, I ordered these buttons because they were a great deal and included a FREE screen protector. I never received one. Though its not a big deal, it would've been nice to get it since they claim it comes with one.",positive
"awesome! stays on, and looks great. can be used on multiple apple products.  especially having nails, it helps to have an elevated key.",positive
These make using the home button easy. My daughter and I both like them.  I would purchase them again. Well worth the price.,positive
Came just as described.. It doesn't come unstuck and its cute! People ask where I got them from & it's great when driving.,positive
it worked for the first week then it only charge my phone to 20%. it is a waste of money.,positive
"Good case, solid build. Protects phone all around with good access to buttons. Battery charges with full battery lasts me a full day. I usually leave my house around 7am and return at 10pm. I'm glad that it lasts from start to end. 5/5",positive
"This is a fantastic case. Very stylish and protects my phone. Easy access to all buttons and features, without any loss of phone reception. But most importantly, it double power, just as promised. Great buy",positive
this case fits perfectly on the s4 and keeps me powerd all day I can't complain! a+ recommend it to all,positive
"This is the first battery case I have had for my Galaxy S4. The S4 fits very well, is slim and doesn't add much weight to the Galaxy S4. It doubles the battery life. You can charge either the battery, the phone or both. There is a handy on-off switch with leds to indicate the level of charge.The battery case came on time and was packaged well. Well worth the price.",positive
"Performs exactly as advertised . It's very  sturdily built,and provides lots of boost . It does exactly what it's supposed too .Easy to insert phone in and out . Definitely a 5 star experience. Don't know what I would do without this case LOVE LOVE LOVE it.",positive
"Unlike Most of the Rechargeable Battery cases, PowerBear Lasts up to 2 whole days. It doesn't heat up like most of the other ones, and I was completely fascinated by the ultra light and sleek design for the case. Before I was using the Mophie case but I couldn't wear it often because it was like having a hot brick in your pocket, Hence I had to always leave it at home.On the contrary, with PowerBear, I never take it off because I can't even tell the difference. Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology won't let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community. Everybody was loving the case, and what they don't know is that it cost  me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand. This is the best purchase I've made on the internet, and I am going to buy more for my family in time for the Holidays. THANK YOU POWERBEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",positive
"Just what I needed. I needed a phone case for myself and my two sons, but I also needed new replacement batteries. Now this isn't the case, since I got both in one. Awesome thanks A+",positive
"When there is no outlets, or chargers near by its Powerbear to the rescue! Ordered one for my husband, and myself. Great purchase!!",positive
"It works great. Doesn't heat up like crazy like the other ones I got, and cheaper too! Its definetly the best power case for the S4 you can get, thats why I got one for me and my wife. I wonder why its called power bear..",positive
"Surprisingly, this inexpensive version works just as well and just as reliably as the expensive variety. It has been working for me for months now. No problem. Excellent value.",positive
"I have tested this against the griffin dual output unit.I checked the charging current.This unit was charging my galaxy note battery with 70 ma.Griffin was charging with 40 ma! And the griffin was 4 times more expensive.I have not used these for very long. I bought 15 of them, because they are so cheap and because they actually do seem to provide high current.No idea how long they last. I assume they will work fine. I have not been using them much. I did the testing , just to stock up on a high current charger. This passed and I stocked up.",positive
It worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely.. so basically a small waste of money.,positive
I love that it has two ports for my phone and ipod. Who wants to be putting too many things in one socket.  Sleek and convenient to store and I just love it.,positive
"does not have the need amps to charge things like ipads, or hp touchpads. but its super small and compact.",positive
"They are nothing special for sure, but it's nice that you can tell when it is powered up by the led that glows in it.  able to charge two phones at once in the car which is nice.",positive
"I have several chargers. Have more than one vehicle so I keep more than one of these in each. Nothing more frustrating than finding all of a sudden one quits working, and you have no way to recharge your phone. That is always when you need it most.  This one works well for any of my products.",positive
I bought this a little skeptical. After I tried it I bought two more. It works great and so far it has lasted for about 3 months. If that changes I will update this review.,positive
"This is a nice charger but you can tell it was made cheaply in China.  When it is charging the phone, the car radio gets LOTS of static.  Not so much that I have to stop charging but like when you are near power lines and the radio station is far away.So, no RF shielding.I gave it 4 stars because it works fine for me, but if you listen to the radio, you might consider it is more like 2 or 3 stars.",positive
Yo get exactly what you order in a timely fashion. And the item is just as described. Great buy if you ask me,positive
"This is a terribly awesome product in my Subaru's console.  Passengers love it, I love it because it emits a blue glow, because it has held up to abuse over the years and performs like new.",positive
"I've bough a munch of different things like this over the years. Most wouldn't stay in the jack, or would give out after a few days. This one is GREAT!",positive
it works great i like i can charge two thing at the same now i dont have to wait for my to finish charging her phone,positive
"It came at last, good looking and the price was good and i believe it is worth the time I waited for it to come to me good job",positive
Didn't last very long. Worked great when it worked but it is a cheap piece of plastic crap so I shouldn't have expected it to last.,positive
"excellent product, works great , have easy handling, and good quality as it is announced. reached as is shown time and in very good condition thank you very much for everything",positive
great charger for 2 devices and i haven't had any problems so far 3yrs now,positive
Purchased product about many a month ago. Pros: Loved it work just fine!! Cool Blue light feature when you plug it into the lighter!! Can plug in two things at one time....Con: Top clear piece came off easily overtime (I just put clear tape around the top) TOTAL: PROS:95% CONS:5%,positive
"I bought this so that I could use and charge my Tab at the same time. My tab does not recognize the high power port and will either charge while off or use power while on, it will not charge while powered on.",positive
"I bought this to charge my iphone and tablet in the car. works for iphone but not the tablet. I needed a stronger charge for that but this is still great for both iphoe and ipod together. it's cheap, small and compact",positive
Works great. The blue led light is a nice touch in the car. We charge a Samsung and Iphone using this outlet. Nice low profile too.,positive
"works great and charges ipads, tablets, smartphones as well as bluetooth speakers and headsets. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a universal car charger.",positive
"I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months, it subsequently died on me.Pros:-Has 2 USB ports for charging, one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.",positive
"This charger works great and is short, unlike most chargers. It does a great job with charging both my phone and my GPS when I am in the car.  Great value and easy on the wallet.",positive
This portable USB Port car charger is a must have for people on the go.  Pair this with an extra or spare cord and you are good to go!,positive
"I love the way it can charge 2 devices at once!  Seems to charge quicker without GPS on, with it on, it only holds the battery, but better than it dying!!!",positive
I received this product before I expected. It looks pretty good and It works with my Iphone (3GS) and my phone (HTC Evo V 3D). It is a good deal because It is not easy to find something like this for this price,positive
"I have several of these, from various retailers, all the same, each made in some anonymous Chinese factory, all exactly alike.They're great. They really do work, and they do deliver 2.1 and 1.0 power as they say they will do. They do the job.You wouldn't expect much QC for a $2 electrical product, but they each work just fine.They don't last forever-- about a year or two of active daily use seems about par, then they suddenly die. So do have some replacements on hand. At this price, no problem.Yes, they work with both my iPhone and iPad. Also with every other USB device I've needed to charge.The LED light that indicates you are plugged in correctly is very helpful.These are great for rental cars and travel. If you leave one behind, hey, it's only $2.I'm totally pleased with these clever little gems. No complaints. I wouldn't be without a couple, especially for travel.Hope this is helpful. Happy trails, all.",positive
good product at low price.purchased this looking for a smaller charger and I love Griffin products.Free shipping just took a little longer,positive
"I use this in my car to charge my phone and my iPod as needed. It works well, but the bright blue light can be annoying when driving at night. Overall, a very good deal.",positive
I love this case! It's so pretty.And I love the way the case feels to the touch because of the rubber. Very happy!,positive
The idea of the design is a sweet idea but it wears off as the paint is over the case and not under a sealant or anything. It has a cool 3D effect but at the cost of the paint rubbing off.It is quite pretty though.,positive
"I was worried about this order because the picture on the description page kept changing to a less-desireable green/orange cover.  But alas, it came a day earlier than expected, and the beautiful pink product expected!  The ""rubberized"" cover feels a little greasy (like it was armor-all'd), but the design is gorgeous and a little 3D looking!",positive
Another pretty phone case that I really love. I have many as I love t o change them around .thanks,positive
"The case is not white, its more of a silver. It's still a very pretty case- it fit my phone perfectly. It took too long to arrive.",positive
Defintiely worth the price...You should order several.  Most cases are $15 and up especially at the cell phone stores.  I can't believe the mark up on these things!,positive
This is a great case... It fit my phone perfectly and I still use it from time to time. Would recommend,positive
"Received this item very quickly. The design is even more vivid than expected. The cover is soft (rubberized) but durable. I have received many compliments. It was an excellent buy! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a ""good look"" for their phone.",positive
this cover makes an old phone look and feel new. I like that I can order covers for little money and snazzy up my phone.,positive
"I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after, the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots. Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase.",positive
"The color is more dark in person, and this isnt the best protection case. I get a lot of compliments on the case, and it was easy to put on.",positive
Simple to install and a great way to help protect your phone.My wife really liked the ability to change the look of her phone.,positive
The case is pretty good. It dose have some scratches on one side of the phone but its every little. Other then that i like it. Ive dropped my phone a few times since putting on the case and it didnt break or scratch. Ive gotten many complements on this case and over all it was worth the few bucks I spent.,positive
This case is afordable and yes it peels very easy but thats to be expected because its a dollor. I bought mine from Electromaster. It snaps on fine for me but if I were to drop my phone the phone would be fine but the case would surely be done for. its only a dollar so do not get your hopes up. it looks great but its for show not for protection. if you want your phone to be protected go the extra mile for an outter box,positive
This is one of my favorite cases I have this one on my phone I really love the color a lot.,positive
"This case for some reason is peeling, there isn't much left of the orginal skin, i  loved the case with pink being my favorite color but i wouldn't recommend this specific one for anyone.",positive
Its rubberized doesn't look like it in the picture but it is It's really cute I love this case used it for awhile but I switch out cases like I do my shoes.,positive
"Received this in about a weeks time. Very nice actually considering how cheap the price was. It's a pink/purple with black leopard spots and has a very nice feel to it. I haven't tried to remove it yet, but hopefully it won't give me any trouble when I do want to change covers.",positive
This case was by far the best case I bought for this phone.  It is very stylish and I received many compliments,positive
"This is the cutest case EVER!  I love it because it was easy to apply.  I had to switch from the rubber one because after so many uses, it wears out like the bottom hem of a sweater that has been stretched.  This case keeps my phone intact and protected at the same time...WOO HOO!!",positive
my daughter liked it for a few days and then i didnt see it anymore on the phone. Use your judgement on that one.,positive
"very good charger, it woks fine, no complaints!!! I would recommend it!! It was good, but not using it anymore!",positive
"This product arrived when promised and in the condition promised. It is a genuine Blackberry charger. It was brand new and worked perfectly. For the price, I don't think you can ask for much more than that!",positive
Great product. Use this with my Galaxy S4. At this price I bought 2 more. One for work and one to keep in the car incase I ever travel and forget my charger.,positive
"Honestly I have always loved this specific model, since you can just take it with you on the road not worrying if you end up losing it or leaving it where ever you go. Though it doesn't exactly meet the fast charging needs of high end phones, it works pretty well on all of them, you just need to be patient.",positive
"I've had this charger well over a year now, and it still works perfectly.  Most chargers would have broken by now.  The folding blades make this more portable than the chargers that come with some Blackberry models that have adapters for different countries.",positive
"so far no problems, it charges fast that is what i need it. it doesn' have an USB as it specified, jus a direct wall charger.",positive
Great ! So far.I had this charger before and it seem to last pretty good 3 years fits most phones except Iphone and Galaxy 5  but that phone can still use it in the right side of the portal it will Judy charge it a bit slower. When this charger goes it tends to loose it's fit firmly in usb and has a short.,positive
Another very good phone charger that does the job and has a  very affordable price that anyone can afford  to buy it.,positive
Works well. We use this for travel and it lives in our luggage most of the year. For the low price having an extra USB charger this works great. Charges our Galaxy S3 and Note 2.,positive
"I needed a charger quick and I didn't want to spend $20.00 at the convenience store for a short, crappy charger. For this price, the charger is great.Pros: The cord length is perfect if you have a tall bed. I don't have to struggle to see my phone when I'm laying down.Cons: The plug in is a little blocky but nothing to worry about. The connecter doesn't like to stay in place 100% of the time. It does NOT fall out but if you wiggle it just right it disconnects the charge. My phone is also old and the port is a little worn. That could be my issue.If you need a good charger for a cheap price. Buy this!",positive
Bought as a spare charger for the house and turned into my main charger because my other one failed. Nice long cable and has held up for tons of charges for my Galaxy S3.,positive
The charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my Samsung Galaxy S3.  They really need to start making these chargers better....I've been thru several!!!!,positive
"This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn't expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!update:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!!",positive
This charger woks wonderfully on the Samsung Galaxy S4.  it chargers the phone fast and the price is great!  Highly Recommended product!,positive
This is another great product and i will always order from here in the future. money spent well!! If you need a great car charger this is the one you need!!,positive
goes into the lighter port a little rough but it charges the phone fine. I wish it had a little more reach so i could use the phone from the passenger seat of the car more comfortably but its not a big problem. it will reach pretty far because of the coiled section but this will put stress on the charge port of your phone which many people dont realize will eventually break it.,positive
"I purchased two of these chargers for my sister and girlfriend. They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am, I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price.I'm happy to report I definitely received 2 OEM Samsung car chargers in the mail in sealed bags with part # barcodes (the kind you'd normally receive in a new/refurb phone). Can't go wrong with the price and certainly can't argue with the benefits of OEM vs. generic (mA output and reliability at the top of the list!).",positive
I bought this for my Samsung Charge. It works perfectly and is built as solidly as the $20 Verizon charger. I highly recommend this car charger and thanks for the great price!,positive
"It does what it needs to do, very pleased. I bought some other cheap lame one and will never go back.",positive
"Charger works great. Haven't had any issues with it at all. I wish it has a retractable cord like some other chargers I've used, but other than that, I love it.",positive
It works great  thus  far no issues.  The only thing i might have limited was a usb Connect or it charges my t989 without fail,positive
"The big store that is in every town now (can't say their name) either does not carry anything or is always out of stock. If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last. I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store. This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now. I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly. Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out. This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk.",positive
Good lengthEasy to useVery fast chargingI would recommend it to persons who use their phone a lot.,positive
luving it  right now will last about 4 mo so you cant beat the price for it I got 4 of them,positive
"JUNK!!!......This product must be miss labeled.  I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger.  The lights are on, the phone says its charging but nothing happens.  I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge.  If you need a reliable charger, DO NOT purchase this product.If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2, I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter.  It charges fast and is dependable.",positive
"A very good car charger for your phones, charged my phone pretty quickly and quite affordable, I recommend it to anyone to have as a back up to your charger.",positive
"The Samsung car charger has stopped working within a 6 month period.  I thought a fuse was blown inside the unit but when I attempted to change it, I've noticed that it doesn't come apart like most vehicle chargers.",positive
"WHAT A GREAT PRICE!RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, PLUG N UPLOAD SUM JUICE ...DON'T KNOW IF DROPPING IT REPEATEDLY ON THE FLOORBOARD,OR OCCASIONALLY STUFFING IT IN CONSOLE TO HIDE CAUSED FAILURE ...BUT SOON THE GREEN LIGHT FAILED TO LIGHT, AND PHONES DISPLAY SHOWEDIT WASN'T CHARGING. SO EITHER SPEND SEVERAL MORE DOLLARS FOR ONE WITHA HEAVIER CORD/STRONGER SHELL OR TREAT IT AS A DELICATE FLOWER.",positive
Sprint wanted $30 fro the same item.  This is OEM and not third party after market. Bought two.  Work great,positive
Plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days. Hasn't worked since. My phone does not even recognize it's plugged in.,positive
This charger works great. I love the fact that the LED on it does not light up until it is plugged into the phone. Great bargain.,positive
"Though I`m not a expert in cell phone chargers. This thing works good, but its not all fireworks and hotel parties. Its a charger and it works so I guess buy it.",positive
I used this charger for a couple of months now. Its a very good charger. It charges my phone very quickly.,positive
It is Samsung brand..works with my Android phones..Galaxy Nexus 4 and Galaxy S2 and S3...recommend it highly for anyone with a microUSB phone,positive
I needed a car charger and this was very affordable and it worksgreat! The same thing from the store was three times the price.,positive
"good oem car charger, i originally bought it for my galaxy S2 and later on that week I upgrated to the Galaxy S3 and it works prefectly fine, I would recommend this product",positive
You have to hold it in a certain place in other for it to charge. I'll just buy the Verizon  charger instead,positive
This charger works perfectly.  It is the official Samsung charger so I was sure it would work just fine. I highly recommend it.,positive
"I use this charger with my GS2 from Straight Talk.  This charger is working as expected, charges the phone fine and seems like a quality product, not flimsy and cheap feeling like some chargers I have ordered in the past.",positive
"This thing worked well when it actually functioned, but today it stopped working and I am past the 30 day return window by 10 days give or take.I'm guessing the quality might not be great as that is why it stopped working, who knows.. What a waste of money.",positive
Hope to use it soon.  My other one worked sometimes.  This one does not have the light on unless you are charging.,positive
"es un cable para carro de excelente calidad , original de samsung , lo tengo algun tiempo sin ningun problema",positive
"I went thru 3 car charges which they all either stopped working after a few uses or never worked to begin with.This car harder not only works it also charges my phone lightening fast!!! LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT!!If u are debating u can rest assured this thing is awesome.",positive
"First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that's forgiveable.  The springs on the side don't have much force, though, so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port.  The cable is sturdy, but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff, which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle.  It's held up well since I purchased it though.UPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month.",positive
Works great nice long cord. Does the trick. Bought several of these to put in diff. rooms & one for work.,positive
Good charger and is perfect because it is also has a USB connection. Also love that it is original material it works like that too giving a quick charge when i need it.,positive
I have had 3 phone chargers go bad in two weeks. I can not say where I purchased them. Most chargers for cell phones are cheaply made. This one is OK I guess.,positive
"I received this product in a very timely manner which was delightful, however, I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item. I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time.",positive
It worked fine for a few days then I had to change to cord........The charger itself working fine up to this point..........Rather than send it back I bought another cord from sprint for $19.00,positive
"fast delivery, works well. Not very long.",positive
This detachable sansung galaxy s2 travel charger is simply good. It works perfectly.  The cherry on the cake is because it is longer than the factory original l received with the phone.,positive
Had all the marking of a legit samsung product but the cord stop working after 3 days. I'm not upset because it was very inexpensive but maybe you should spend a little more and buy a better product off amazon. When it did work it worked very well.,positive
"First off, the charger works just as it should and all the ports stay connected just fine.People in other reviews were complaining that the cord was too short-- about 2 or 3 feet-- and that was what I was expecting. Instead, I got a 5 foot cord which is a bit long for the purpose I was going to use it for (in my car). Now I have a long cord dangling everywhere. That extra length may be a bonus for most, but I bumped down the rating due to seller's lack of description and/or consistency. Also I'm fairly certain the product image was changed because when I ordered it, a different style adapter was pictured... I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end... hmm. There's no way to verify that now.In sum: Good charger with good connectivity, looks and acts like it's an original Samsung.  Cord length and adapter style may vary as it seems like the seller is not consistent.",positive
it's a charger for dirt cheap and the shipping wasn't more than the item. I wish they had the batteries i needed as well for my phone. but great all an all,positive
"This charger doesn't charge the battery of my Samsung Galaxy S2 (i9100) properly.When I connect it to my S2, the screen gets frozen and the cell behaves in a unusual (abnormal) way.",positive
This charger is exactly like the original one that came with my phone.  It is most definitely a good buy for the price!,positive
"works good with our phones, better actually than the charger that came with one of the phones initially , great price",positive
"I would like to start off by saying that this product is what I ordered and I have no complaints about shipping or the condition of the product when it came to my house, the problem I do have is the micro usb cable that comes with the charger. Why is it that all of the different companies that sell chargers on Amazon can get the plug part of the charger right but not the micro usb cord? The cord is cheap and not the original cord that comes with the other part of the charger. I am having the same issue with the charger that I ordered for my galaxy note 2. It's a very thin cord, and also very short. Maybe, a 2 21/2 foot cord? And its of a cheaper quality than the part of the charger that the micro usb plugs into...",positive
thank you. it did not disappoint. was as expected and does the job though I am going to a new phone as the galaxy 2 has been acting up consistently. shutting down by surprise etc...,positive
I love it.  It charges my phone quickly and the cord is super long.  I leave it at home but will purchase another to leave at work.,positive
"After 2 weeks my charger just fell apart while i was taking it from the plug , not a strong charger at all i would have asked for my money but it wasn't even worth it .",positive
I am pleased with this purchase.  The detachable cable option gives very good flexibility for use with other USB cable chargers.  Good quality for a travel charger.,positive
charges me up all the way. doubles my battery liek promised. case protects well and the color is awesome nice,positive
"The color is amazing all of my friends are jealous and ask me where did I get it. They are even more jealous when I tell them how much I paid for it! Great case, powers me up and VERY stylish. Matches my 5C PERFECTLY :)",positive
much slimmer than I thought and it ads 125% battery. I am charged for the full day with this case.,positive
"Great quality product , I love this case it is the perfect sidekick to an always dyeing phone . Now my phone is charged anywhere anytime thanks to powerbear . Really like the name of the case as well !! 5 stars deff !",positive
This case helps me run my day smoothly without having to worry about my phone dying. Plus the color is very beautiful.,positive
"This PowerBear case is a lifesaver!! Charges fast, always reliable. I also love the glossy texture of the case. Highly recommend!!",positive
"This is a very well built and designed case,with a very cool and attractive color. Phone dies too quickly without it",positive
"I was surprised it game in three steps, but when i put the case together and slid my phone in, i loved it. It is hard to get off",positive
I was looking for something different to my wife and this case its strong and beautiful. Good price and i recommend it.,positive
"Love it this case is just what I expected and I love the design, it is slim and protects my case more than I thought it would.",positive
"this is really cute phone case, i like it alot, and it came in when it stated it would too",positive
"Really cute but the heart doesn't really show up if you have the white iPhone 4. 3 piece case & fits like a glove, looks really cute. Shipping took about 2-3 weeks but really enjoy the case. Do recommend.",positive
Great case for my phone. Protects and keeps me charged. easy access to the button and sounds good too. i like it,positive
Other power cases muffled the speaker sound. This one had a great sound port on the back for clear listening.,positive
"Wow!  What a cute battery case! I saw a Christian sister with one of these on her phone!  That gave ne an idea-I decided to order me and my sister a battery case-mine is white, (since my phone is white), and my sister's is black,(since her phone is blue).Anyway, these little guys give you power for your phone! If we run out juice, especially when on the go, we can just connect this case to our phone, and it is POWER ON THE GO!! (I'm just concerned about the functionality).",positive
Great case. Doubled my battery life like promised. Can't beat the price. I would recommend it for a friend. A+,positive
"Great case, sturdy, doubles battery, wont have to worry any more. I purchased this for my kid and he is very HAPPY.",positive
"Bought one for me and the wife (diff color;phone, not  wife, lol.). Firefighter work 24 hr shift and never know when if will get to recharge so this is perfect for me and anyone else that can't always plug in to charge each day.",positive
couldnt watch movies on the htc without the battery dying. the phone is great for entertainment. but battery could be better. the powerbear cases is a great fit and a good kick stand on teh back for entertainment. im sold,positive
This product is great. I like the kickstand on the back. The power indicator is very convenient to know charge pack status.,positive
Not Many HTC one battery cases for sale and this one is pretty good for the price. I would give it 4.5 stars and 5 if the price was $5 cheaper.,positive
"I never do this, but I almost bought this product based off of the amazing sounding fake reviews provided by the shills for PowerBear. If you look at all the positive reviews for this case, you will see that none of them are verified purchases and yet every negative review, other than this one of course, is a verified purchase. What that means is that everyone who has actually bought and used this product thinks that it is crap. Furthermore, many of the reviewers have posted twice on this product, once per color. Why Amazon allows this is beyond me, but that is not the point. Also, if you look at the profiles of the positive reviewers, you will see that they have posted multiple positive reviews for PowerBear products and many of the reviews are carbon copies of each other. Beware the paid shills!",positive
"This is absolutely amazing, more than doubles my battery life, so I can forget about carrying my charger all the time.For such a good price, this is just the right deal. A++++++++",positive
"My brother just got the HTC One, and I promised him an awesome case like the one I have for my S4.Super sleek look, fits well, doesn't get overheated and saves the day every now and then! Especially when GPS is needed!",positive
The raised edges protect the screens from falls. The battery case looks stylish and charges me up. This case is fannnnntastic,positive
fits well on the phone and it is easy to use. the price is unbeatable and the product works like advertised,positive
The S5 is a fantastic phone. However because of its large screen the phone dies quickly. With the extended battery I am able to enjoy all of the phones features without losing power. Great buy.,positive
"Totally worth the money, It protects my phone in even of the most dangerous situations where I dropped my phone and it also keeps my battery going for Days. BRAVO!",positive
"I got this case for my nephew, and he claims that it was not what he expected. He has a charge case for his last phone, and it covered the whole thing. This is just like a back of the phone replacement, so it doesn't add to much weight",positive
"This is a really great case, looks and feels amazing, not to mention that the battery lasts for many hours.",positive
"I think this case is an excellent choice, since it is not so bulky, the color is nice, the texture on the back is good for gripping, and it extends battery life. It's a life saver, and there isn't too much on the market at the time for this phone so I am happy with it. Bought both blue and black for me and my brother right after we got home from the phone store. Would recommend.",positive
I was looking for a case for my new Galaxy S2 (At&t version). The store was selling similar cases for $20 and $35. I just can't justify spending that much on a case. This case is made for the unlocked version of the Galaxy S2. The size is the same. The only difference that I can see is the noise cancelling microphone is blocked. I drilled a little hole in the case and it works just fine,positive
i was raving to a friend about how amazon has great phone cases and how cheap they are and bought him this. it didn't even fit his phone right. poorly made.,positive
"nice case, protective and good looking, it also has a nice changing texture in some areas. good buy for the price",positive
"Bought this for my new AT&T; Galaxy SII, the case arrived super fast, its fits the phone perfectly and snug. I have no issues with any buttons, and the rubber is in a smooth, sort of laminated finish. It does not stick to your pockets. Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase, especially for so cheap.And just FYI: This is for the AT&T; (i777), or International (i9100) Galaxy SII.This WILL NOT FIT Sprint, T-Mobile or the AT&T; Galaxy SII Skyrocket phones. You've been warned.",positive
"I liked the case, and for the amount of money paid, its a good buy, i personally like stronger cases, this is very flexible and indeed looks like a hard case, a little bit of more firmness wouldnt hurt.Protects VERY well the phone as well as the camera lens there is not one single part of the phone touching the surface of the table when i leave it there. Very Good purchase.",positive
"Like most of the other reviews say, this rubbery case has a smooth exterior, so it doesn't feel like an uncomfortable sticky rubber.  While still appearing to have a hard shell, the rubber itself is fairly soft, and does a great job of protecting from falls without feeling too bulky.",positive
"the case did not fit my phone; was a tad too small.  i could only get 3 corners into the case.  i wound up buying a two piece case that cost about $20 from a local store.  have dropped the phone so many times the case is beat to s***, and no damage to the phone.  good reason to buy a case, just not this one.my co-worker delayed in getting a case because he could not find one he liked, and broke the display screen, making his phone unusable.  buy a case, not this rubber thing.  i threw mine away within 5 minutes of it's arrival",positive
This skin fits perfect in my SGSII and the phone looks great inside of it.It is a high quality skin and gives a very good feeling in your hands.I recommend this product for your SGSII.,positive
I like the case so far fits ok my Samsung Galaxy S2 I like that is very shiny and soft to the touch. My only concern is one of the corners is not totally covered so it wont protect it from scratches or a hit there that is why I am just giving it 4 stars. Well for the price i think it is ok.,positive
Don't expect more but it works well for the reason you buy.I was looking for a cheap skin case and was not willing to pay a hefty amount for the case at least for the initial period after buying my unlocked galaxy s II.Din't Expect much before buying.But it really does work well.4 $ with 2 day shipping free is really a good deal if you are looking for a perfect tpu case protecting your phone.,positive
Great case fit my samsung galaxy s2 great will order again fast shipping it make my phone look super sexy trust me you need to order 1.,positive
I read the first few reviews and didn't read any further and now I wish I had cause this thing does not work for the Sprint Galaxy s2. Wish I had known that.,positive
Be careful when ordering these cases. Not all Galaxy II's are the same. Mine was a Sprint and this one did not fit my pnone. It went into the trash can as it wasnt worth sending back. Otherwise I am sure it's a great case.,positive
"arrive on time, good quality, functionally, recomend to protect the samsung galaxy S 2 I9100, fit exactly , recomend to the owners of this smartphone .",positive
"I was expecting a bit higher quality product but it is what it is. I've used it for a few months and it definitely helped when I dropped my phone. But at this point, I am not using it anymore due to the quality of the product, although 'good', it could be better and more solid.",positive
"there is a different between the size/design of Galaxy II that is carried by USA and what's carried by Asia.  I'm in USA, I ordered the cover for Galaxy II that i bought from USA, the cover didn't fit, and the speaker location is different from the phone.  I copmared the cover to another Galaxy II that is sold in Asia and i found that the design is different.So if you bought Galaxy II from USA, don't buy cover from outside USA",positive
"It is good, and look so cute. I like it. It is cheap than when i saw in a store.",positive
"I made a good choice whenI thought of buying this, its very safe, & not to bulky! Overall very satisfied customer.",positive
Very satisfied with my purchase. The quality is good and the shipping is quick. The case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone. TPU (the plastic material where the case is made of) virtually resists oil and dust. I used to have an Otter box for my other phone. The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy. The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not. To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case. The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?). I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm. Overall I feel my phone secured in the case.,positive
"totally awesome, It was made with good quality and I would purchase this again in another color it still looks new!",positive
this case is better than i thought i love the feel and design and it is well made and doen not collect dust.,positive
"This product arrived quickly. It fits my HTC and is easy to get on and off, I have no complaints.",positive
"Great Grip, Great Style, Gerat Durability, Great PRICE! Lasts long. SLIM FIT! Should be included in every HTC sensation purchase and if it was it may have beaten the iPhone 5! Too bad HTC",positive
"A note of caution from someone who owned and used just about every major Blackberry model: if you already own a standard USB 2.0 cable and you don't need an extra, then you do NOT need this cable. All a Blackberry needs for data transfer is a STANDARD USB 2.0 cable with a Micro-USB connector at one end.There is NOTHING special about this cable and nothing justifies the artificially inflated MSRP listed for it. While this item is sold at a 90% off the MSRP discount, it's probably okay to purchase one, for as long as, after reading the first paragraph you decide that you will need a USB 2.0 cable.The items has 2 stars taken away for the exaggerated marketing claim (professional grade custom cable) and for the inflated MSRP.NOTE: Please make sure that you buy cable with a MICRO-USB connector because this is what your Blackberry needs.",positive
this is a good product is just a usb cable it work perfect just like a oem cable. . .,positive
"Well, went on the internet first....$14.00, then to a very well known store, here in Gloucester, MA, $28.  I was not happy.  Then, of course, I knew Amazon would come up with something...they did, $4.00 and change...it arrived promptly.  I cannot say enough about Amazon, they are realistic in their prices, knowing that people do not have that kind of money to pay for a wire,,for 14 or 28 dollars. I have never been so happy to get what I need without spending my last dollar for it.  Thank you again and again.",positive
"I would like a extra cable for my smartphones at work, so I purchased this one. Nothing special as long as it is working, and it is.No complain.",positive
"There is a difference in USB cables.  On some computers, including mine, the USB ports are underpowered, and some poor cables do not transmit data well.  I have purchased some cheaper cables that would not transmit data between my computer and my Blackberry Storm 9530.  This cable works great, even with my underpowered USB ports.",positive
"I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap, and that it is. I use this with my Nexus s 4g from sprint and although it does indeed charge my device it causes some major issues, such as screen lag, my computer not being able to recognize what kind of device this is, and causing my phone to constantly jump into car mode. So if you need a real quick cable for basic charging, this will do it, anything else...spend the extra buck on a higher end cable.",positive
"I purchased 3 of these cables because they were cheap and got good reviews.  I don't know how people are getting these cables to work... but out of the 3 I bought, 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre!  The best I can do is get it to charge, though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about ""Unknown Device"" and ""Could not install drivers"" even though it works beautifully with the original cable.  The only setting that works is ""Just Charge""!  Each of the 3 cables fails slightly differently which makes me believe that each has a different flaw!  I've tried this with my Wife's Palm Pixi as well as used different computers and that failed as well.  Look elsewhere when attempting to purchase a cable for your Palm device!",positive
this phone cord is so easy to use and easily connected from phone to computer. great value for the price.,positive
"This cable is better than original.  Never any issues with phone recognizing USB connection, as the original does, when plugged to PC.",positive
"I bought this recently and did not expect much, as it was only $2.99 shipped to my door.  For that much money, how can you go wrong?  So, I have not used it to transfer data yet, as it it plugged into my PC at work just for charging.  When plugged in, my Palm Pixi prompts me, just as the factory cable does, to transfer or charge.  I have used this cable about 10x to charge now, and it works great!  Do not hesitate to purchase this if you need another cable, or two!",positive
"A good inexpensive cable that works like the original.  I purchased this cable because I wanted one that would work with the touch stone I just purchased.  After reading several reviews and looking at competing cables I deciding on this one.  While several inches shorter (40"") than the original it works well and with the touch stone.  I used this cable mainly for use in the car.",positive
"The cable worked great with the pre if you need an extra one, but I suggest purchasing the whole unit--plug and all, not just the cable, because with shipping and handling it gets to be the same price.",positive
not much to say about a wall charger except it charges my bluetooth perfectly.  I'm glad I bought it.  Thank you!,positive
"This charger does the trick.  The charger in my car doesn't work when the ignition is off, and who wants a dangling cord hanging down in their field of vision while driving.Have charged the T505 up once since I got it, and the battery life is reported to be around 18 hours of usage or 30 days of standby.  I may charge it every couple of weeks.  Very convenient accessory.",positive
"The Motorola T505 doesn't come with an AC charger, only a DC charger. This makes a great addition to the package. You can charge in your home at night.",positive
"I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers.  So I took a chance (due to the low price and free shipping) and was pleasantly surprised.  The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader, PDA, camera, etc., and at less than 25% of the cost.  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems.",positive
we bought this charging cord because the t505 only came with a car charger.  we now have 2 t505 with the 2nd one intended for use with connecting our bluetooth enabled phones with the home stereo.  this cord offers a convenient way to charge both as we are not in the car for long enough periods for the device to charge completely while travelling.  by bringing in the devices we are able to charge overnight to a full charge.  great price and no complaints with receipt of material in either packaging or transit time.,positive
"It's true! This cable outperforms the original! When I charge my phone, it's chargier. The data is more datery and the phone is more phoney in general. If I wear the cable around my neck like a bolo tie, people like me better and I can run faster and jump higher.  If I circle my dinner plate with it, the food tastes better. Basically this cable makes everything better than the original. I'm thinking about getting a 2nd one!",positive
"I'll never understand how one review can say this item works exactly as it should and how the next complains about it not working...for the EXACT same phone! I just don't get it. I decided to try it out despite the people that said it didn't work, and I'm glad I did. It's exactly what I expected and wanted. I actually bought 2 of these so I could leave one in my car and one at work. For only $4 and some change for the both...this was a GREAT buy for me and now I never have to worry about my Incredible running out of battery!",positive
I was really impressed by the price and was very excited when it arrived. But it doesn't work like it says it does. At first it charged my phone just fine but then it stopped charging; I waited a day to charge again but it still didn't charge.,positive
I use this cord to charge my phone in my pc at work and it works great. Doesn't charge super fast but charges it none the less.,positive
this product is great value for the price. and it works like it suppose to. you can't beat it. you always need extra cords.,positive
"cable works fine with my verizon Galaxy S4, it charges and transmit the data fine.However, connector tip(phone side) is too thick, it won't fit if you use aftermarket cases.",positive
"The cable is good, but it does not fit the Samsung Galaxy S4. It does plug in, but not far enough in to hold securely.",positive
It works and is a good value for the price compared to the retail stores. The only negative is that it is just a tad too short.,positive
works great. it is always good to have backup cables and this one works great and replaced my old one.,positive
I have purchased many chargers for my Samsung phone on amazon and honestly the quality is just so so on them.  Maybe I'm just really hard on chargers but I feel like they should last more than a few months.  Spend the money and get a good quality one.,positive
it works great and came at the right time you can never have enough chargers for every where lol thanks,positive
These were really inexpensive and they work just like I wanted them to.There have been no problems so far,positive
"It was what I expected to be and works fine, thought it might have been a larger gauge of wire?",positive
"Works fine IF you don't move the phone.  If you handle the phone, the plug works its way out within two or three minutes.  This despite a relatively stiff fit.  Note that the cord that came with the phone plugs in smoothly and securely.  That's my general-use cord now; this one is relegated to overnight charging where the phone isn't being used.",positive
Disappointed at how cheap they are and doubt they were designed for newer devices.  They are also very short.  Took a long time to ship.  Specifically purchased due to the ad saying they were for Samsung Galaxy devices.  It did not work in my S4.  They require a good charger a d one that is newer and better.,positive
It Works perfect. It charges my phone pretty quickly and it's great that it retracts. No problems with this charger.,positive
"This is an excellent divice, I have order several within 6 months for family and friends who wanted to take mine. Love it!",positive
"This charger doesn't work very well. When plugged in, it shows that it is charging, but after ten minutes I'm lucky to get 1% more on my battery. I only use it now if my battery is low and I want to keep it from getting lower...that's really all it's good for.",positive
"I was pretty upset to find that one day it stopped charging my phone, right in the middle of a long trip. FFFFFFUUUUUUU...",positive
I really like this charger and not having the cord hanging around all the time when it's not necessary.  Item was received quickly and was as seller stated. The cord retracts in a snap when I'm done with it. It also pulls out to whatever length so that I can just pull it out a short way to plug my phone in and the cord is not everywhere. I recommend it!,positive
"It works, that's about all that can be said for it. It charges my Galaxy fine, but cord does not retract. Mine came with a busted spring. Cheap enough I don't care, not worth the shipping to return. It charges, I suppose that's all that matters",positive
"Initially it is a great charger at a great price. However, I've been through 2 now and they tend to not last very long. For the price though I guess it's still not a bad deal.",positive
"love it for moving from car to car.  great for a mobile person. can pack in brief case or backpack when travel, without worry about cord hanging or wrapping.",positive
"The charger works fine.  It was a great value considering how much they cost in stores.  However, it doesn't retract at all.",positive
was somewhat concerned after reading some of the reviews. Price was great so I bought extras just in case. Quality seems great. Cord not quite as flimsy as expected from other comments. Love not having the cords getting tangled in car,positive
I love the retractable feature as it hides away so nicely. I does the job just as well as a thick corded device. excellent product.,positive
"This works just fine to recharge my Captivate. With some products, it's impossible to get a good tight connection to the phone at the USB end; this one does not have that problem.",positive
"Item shipped and arrived very fast. Item is perfect for my car & phone, very compact. Item is as advertise.",positive
Great I gave it to my GF and she loves it.,positive
"I like how long the cord is with this changer so that I'm able to reach the night stand and table from where I plug it in at.  However, I'm not a fan of how long it seems to take to charge to full charge, nor how it atomically &#34;stops&#34; charging at certain times on it's own.",positive
This is a very good charger to keep for travel and as a back up in your house. I use it frequently.,positive
"I was very pleased with this item when I got it back so quickly because it was a gift. However, I cannot give a 5 star rating for a product that never worked.",positive
"The Phone charger works, it charges the phone. However, while the phone is charging it continually beeps as when the battery is too low.It will not stop beeping while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage.I do not think this is the correct charger to be using on the phone I have.Now I am worried based on other reviewers that the battery may blow on the phone and I'll have to replace that too.I would not recommend buying this charger.The charger from my old blackberry works better.",positive
"I had to replace the cord from the first one I purchased a month ago, but this one is great.",positive
It works great. It has a longer cord than the one I got with the phone. I would recommend this item.,positive
"When i went to take the charger out of my wallit snapped in half. Lesson learned,cheap things break too quickly.",positive
"This power cord is a great replacement for the standard dual use cord that comes with your phone. By dual use, I mean, the standard cord that comes with your phone is a usb data cable with a dc power plug on the end. Sometimes I am using the phone and just one twist or tug of the line and the cable will disconnect from the dc power supply, which I imagine will cause the data cable to short out over time and also may ruin the battery. Phone companies just got cheap and decided to stop sending phones with a power cable AND a data cable separately, but in the end, you will go out and get yourself a standard power cable...like this one, which is just fine...quality-wise and price-wise. Yep. Oh, and this does have a big red light that comes on once you plug it into the wall, whether your phone is plugged to it or not, so if you are one of those nit picky sleepers that needs a completely dark room to sleep, you stick yourself a small piece of black electrical tape over the light, because it is brighter then you may think.",positive
we've had it a month and it's working great. wish the cord was a little longer but it's much longer than the one you get with the phone.,positive
"it works and it works well. i go through chargers pretty quickly so im hoping this one will hold up. so far, so good! the wire is thick and its well put together! as far as im concerned, its well worth the small amount",positive
"Thanks for the quick delivery time. And, it actually is a quality note pad! Mom loves it, it was a replacement gift for another brand from another company that did not work, this one is awesome!",positive
I love that this has a longer cord!  It fits great in my phone!  Very pleased you have it so cheap!  Thanks!,positive
"Paid $0.32 for the charger and $2.81 Shipping & Handling.....Yeah, I know the shipping & handling was much more expensive than the charger was but I needed a charger that connected and this one fit nice and snug so I am able to charge my phone while sitting at my desk in my home office at my computer looking for work.....which is an all day job huh?  LOL!  Wow, I wish I could write reviews for a living wouldn't that be nice?  I think the total price of $$3.13 was a great savings compared to how much the retailers that sell the mobile phones charge anywhere from $10-$20.  Ms_Thrifty has done it again!  Stay tune to more reviews, Oh how I love Amazon!",positive
Gave this 4 of 5 stars because the cord is waaaaaaay too short. Works well. Charges phone quickly also. Wouldn't buy again however.,positive
Its a charger and it works as advertised. It also cam in the mail pretty quickly so I am satasfied with that as well.,positive
"U can never have too many.  Bought this as a spare for purse, home and work.  Now I don't have to worry about forgetting it.",positive
"Product came really fast, nice long cord, which was great considering factory cord is so short. Worked great til the third day, then I don't know what happened...at the price I didn't expect perfection, and at Sellers defense,I have not contacted them..it could easily be my own fault and I've been so busy...even review is late. (Sorry)",positive
Bought as gift for my relative and he loves it.....Great job...Would highly recommend this product to all customers.Thank you,positive
"Where you mainly use your blue tooth is when you need to be hands on the wheel...driving.If your BT is down on battery charge, this is handy.  I just wish the length of the cord were longer....I already had a plug-in in the charger nearest me....!",positive
I have used this car charger for the last 2 months. So far all is well. Nice retractable cord. It retracts at the push of a button.,positive
"I have not used this as of yet , however, my wife has without issue.I have the x50 headset and she has the voyage, it works on both really well.",positive
works great for powering my Plantronics BT. i like the retractable cord so it doesnt have a long cord getting in the way. nice and compact and easy to store when not in use,positive
good,positive
"I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset. I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings, but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset. It is clean. No scratches. No faded labeling. It looked to be brand new. Oh yeah...it works great, too.&#128077;",positive
"I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece.  The sound quality is great, and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this.  The mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it.  Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume (another nice feature) or by moving the mic away from my mouth.  Overall good purchase for the money.",positive
"I've been using one of these for years!  I replace it with a new one when the old one wears out.  The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me.  The ear-pad is comfy, and I occasionally forget I have this on.  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion.  I don't have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through.",positive
"Love this type of headset.  I use one at work every day, so I got one for home too.  I hate things &#34;in&#34; my ear, so this quality over-the-head type keeps everything where it belongs and I can wear it for hours with no pain or irritation.  Comfortable and lightweight.  Doesn't even mess up hair.  It includes a leatherette &#34;cup&#34; for the ear speaker, but I usually don't even use it, finding it comfortable even without it.  It converts to an &#34;ear hook&#34; type also, but I don't find that very useful.  The inline volume control and mute is nice, although a bit large and heavy.  Great sound quality",positive
"This headset works fine, but I expected somewhat better sound quality for the price. Also have not been able to get it to work with my Samsung Galaxy, I'm guess that was an issue with the 2.5 to 3.5 mm plug adapter I got since it works fine with my panasonic cordless phone. Not sure if this would allow you to initiate a call on the cell phone, however, which is what I am really looking for from a headset since bluetooth headset sound quality is so poor.",positive
"I bought this for its durability, but the sound quality was pretty low/poor; volume was low too.",positive
"This is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard Plantronics quality (i.e. very good). The 2.5mm jack means it won't fit on some mobile phones (this is smaller than a standard headphone jack), but for my Blackberry it's great (both 8820 and Pearl). As a bonus, I also use it with my XBOX 360 controllers (both with the attached messenger keyboard and without) for online gaming. Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it.There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug, but this doesn't seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation.It's held up quite well over the past few years, being stuffed in bags and traveling around. It's not as cool as the wireless headsets (bluetooth etc) but it doesn't take batteries, doesn't have to be recharged and isn't subject to interference. I'll buy it again if/when this one finally dies.",positive
I love the product even though I messed up and didn't know I needed a 3.5 so had to purchase adaptor.  I had a small issue that was my own fault and this company was outstanding with customer service.,positive
"Excited about this based on good reviews, but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone, person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound.  I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell, and they said the problem went away, so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also, just FYI, this does not come retail packaged, but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions.  Not a problem for me, but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality.",positive
These have great sound and my voice is clear to other parties. The volume switch and mute slider work well and it has lasted for some time.,positive
"I've been buying these headsets for several years, recommending them to friends and associates and now I'm buying them as gifts for the headset challenged. You know, people who literally have pains in their neck from clamping a phone between their head and shoulders.These are wonderful headsets. I've used them with a variety of cordless and cell phones. As long as you have a 2.5mm socket, you're in business. Audio reception is excellent even for those like me with moderate hearing loss. And the microphones are simply top-notch.I've had only one break and that was because I crammed it into a travel case - and I mean crammed. With regard to ordinary daily abuse, these hold up well.All in all, an excellent value.Jerry",positive
"I've tried and returned at least 5 headsets ranging from $15 to $150. This one was typical of the others that I returned, low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone. I finally ended up with a Panasonic TCA60 for about $19 which is very loud and sounds great on both ends. It's nothing fancy, no volume control and no mute, but who needs that when you can accomplish the same thing with your phone. Price does not determine sound quality. I recommend this product.",positive
"A nice change for me - having a headset that doesn't slip and slide, fall out of my ear, or buzz. My favorite feature is the button that controls the sound level the recipient of my call experiences. The only time is doesn't work well is when the listener is also wearing a headset, and even then, I suspect that it is the fault of the listener's headset and not mine.",positive
"The only problem with this headset is that people you are talking to will have trouble hearing you.  This is pretty important to me, so I only give it 2 stars.  I have used it extensively with both my cell phone and my cordless phones at home with the same problem.",positive
Before buying this set I searched a lot and did read a lot of reviews and finally I chose to go with this set. The screwdrivers are very easy to use specially with iphones.I had to change the batterry on my iphone and if Stanley screwdriver set was not there I was about to break my iphone.Thanks for making this set so helpful and easy to use.,positive
Handy little set to have around if you tinker with electronic devices. This set has many uses for otherthings also. Product is as described and price is right. I recommend everyone having a set.,positive
"I bought this set to fix a pair of eyeglasses that had loose screws. The smallest screwdriver in this kit was perfect for that job, so mission accomplished. The tops of each screwdriver twirls independently from the shaft, meaning you can keep a finger on top of the head to stabilize the driver while you're screwing. (Sorry, there's no other way to say that.) The box suggests these screwdrivers can be used for repairing eyeglasses, cameras, watches, fishing reels, hobbies, electronics, and small appliances. I think this set will come in very handy.",positive
"Screwdrivers work well, however plastic separator tool tip broke off on the first phone case I used it to open...what a drag.",positive
I like them but they are not super duty materials. Works great for the application but when I was dismantling a hard drive one of them stripped.  Im not too concerned because of the price. Over all good value!,positive
"The one plastic wedge broke on first use.  Otherwise, it is about what I expected.  A usable set of tools for phones and some laptops.",positive
"The Torx screw drivers work wonderfully and the tweezers work well, but the pry tool is too weak and ineffectual for the project I used them on.I bought this kit to remove the cameras out of my HTC 4G LTE and I didn't have any problems except for removing the small plastic portion on the bottom rear side of the phone.  The pry tool was way too flimsy for the job and I'm not convinced that it would do the trick for any similar function.I'd recommend this kit if you primarily purchased it for the Torx drivers but not if you require the use of the pry tool as well.",positive
"This comes with 4 flats and 2 philips. I believe they are also metric in sizes. I used one to take a part a netbook. I like the fact that they spin, come in a plastic kit. They are reasonably priced. These items are high quality. Handles are small and can be hard to loosen a screw if torqued down. I used them for a laptop not as a jeweler so... Nice case, nice color, small area, ... Comes in a card board cover as well. Packaged and more packaged. A little over doing it there. Can't be at times a little difficult to open the plastic case. Was going push up or down. Comes with different sizes. Some of the flats seemed a little thick in the blade. Not a bad item for the price. Always good to have a set of these around for glasses/sunglasses or for other items with small screws.",positive
I had to replace the battery on my phone cause it had gone completely flat. Apple was charging a lot and this battery did the job perfectly for a lot cheaper and came with the tools.,positive
"Installation was easy and the tool kit worked though the plastic tools are no the robust and will break if you tweak on them too much. The paper foil was coming off the battery when I open the package but folding back in place worked, once it's in the phone it is not an issue. So far the phone charges fast and the life is much better than the 2 year old battery it replaced. So far I would recommend this battery.Update: 4 weeks after installing this battery is would only last 5 hours and that was barely using the iPhone with NO voice calls at all during that time and no extra heavy use of the internet or anything. Drained it and charged from dead several times, made sure that location services, blue tooth, apps closed... all OFF and still drained. Got my money back and bought one for 1/2 the price and that one works great! Maybe I just got a defective battery.... A risk we all take when buying these 3rd party batteries.",positive
"The tools helped greatly. I used the tools it provided and followed the instruction video on Youtube. Everything was done in about 30mins, for a beginner like me. The battery, which replaced my 2-year old original one, works well so far after about one and half months. It gets charged very quickly and lasted very long. For average user like me, the battery last for about 10 + hours every full charge.",positive
bought tool kit to do a battery upgrade on my cell phone. since it has an embedded battery I needed to take the phone apart. like the saying goes when you got the right tools things go a lot easier most of the time.,positive
"Used this in a phone I repaired, battery fit perfectly and seemed to work fine, phone was on 5 percent, left it for two days, then I checked and it was on 1%, seems legit.",positive
"I must agree with Gary Tuscon's review. For under $5, even though the smallest flat-head screwdriver in here is 1.4 mm (too large for the screws that hold the links on a Seiko women's watchband), the quality is such that I will keep them. The case is very good and labeled very clearly. The screwdrivers have a decent weight as well and the handles turn smoothy.If these came in smaller sizes, with tempered tips that smaller sized tools need to be strong, I would definitely consider them as well.If I had one minor nitpick, it would be that a color-coding of the handles would be a great help, but really, this is an excellent value for the price.",positive
These tools gets the job done. Had no problem I was able to finish less than a hour going to also buy two more for my friends. great deal and quality product quick and fast Thanks!!,positive
Very pleased with this tool kit.  I have already gotten a couple phones repaired with this kit with no loss anywhere in the kit.  Would purchase again if necessary.,positive
"This set has some very unique screw driver  heads, the kind of set you need for working on cell phones or household small appliances. You would have a hard time finding some of them.",positive
"the torx is the only real useful tool in here for the evo4g. not a big fan, just use a credit card instead",positive
Seem to be high quality compare with the cost. Have every thing I needed (or more) to open my Motorola Droid.,positive
"I should've ordered at least two sets.  These come in handy for a lot of things, home, workplace, etc.  And as soon as others know you have them, they need to &#34;borrow&#34;.  Keep you eye on them!  Great tool for a lot of little projects.  Fair price.",positive
"These tools are better than expected. The handles are hard plastic but fit my hand nicely and the the rotating tops work well. The tweezer ends match perfectly so they pick up small parts with ease. Similarly, the driver tips are well machined and accurately sized. Only the plastic prying tool seems a bit flimsy, but it nevertheless held up to some hard prying without breaking. In all, a good deal and I'm ordering a second set this evening.",positive
Needed for my Razr cellphone to change the internal battery.  More tiny screwdrivers than I'll ever use but are of good quality for what I needed.,positive
"Seeing is how the 2, 5 star reviews on this item are from fake users who seem to be trash talking other iphone battery sellers and 5 staring there own is pretty messed up so therefore it appears this seller is some type of scammer.",positive
"After viewing some youtube videos on this procedure, I was able to swap the battery in about 1/2 hour (which included taking pictures and studying the insides of the iPhone 4S.The tools are good enough to get the job done -- I never felt that the tools were going to fall apart.  In fact, I'm keeping them around for other mobile phone work.The only thing I'd recommend (esp. for older folks with not-so-good eyesight) is a good way to magnify things so you can see what you're doing.  I use a big magnifying glass, 1.5x reading glasses (3x would be better), a headlamp (to add light where I need it).",positive
"Pros- Good tool set if you need to take things apart.Cons- They came in a plastic bag (no case)- They're extremely flimsy plastic that makes me feel like if I use them over 10 times, they're going to break.I don't recommend this at all and would recommend you buy something other than this.",positive
"i bought these tool to us for repairing my nephews iphone 4 but non of them were the right size, so if you buying them for the iPhone don't buy these",positive
"Does not fit the 4s so make sure you are ordering the right one.  You will need tools, so I suggest you get one with tools.",positive
I had to pop open my Samsung Galaxy S3 to fix it up but none of the tools I had worked or fit. These worked perfectly and fit the screws and took it apart with ease. Compact and easy to carry around.It arrived on time and in good shape. Thanks!,positive
worked great,positive
"I use these for electronics repairs.  There are several sizes and configurations to meet various needs.  The most helpful thing about them is the independently turning barrel which allows you to apply pressure on the end of the tool and easily turn the barrel/screw right or left.  They may not be the best tools on the market, but they have served me well.",positive
"Nothing too special over here.  Just some screwdrivers.  Seem to hold up well.  I used them on my g-shock band, and they worked and didn't strip, so I was pleased.",positive
"I got this to try and replace a screen, found out I'm not a phone repair person.  It did have what I needed, lacking skill needed to do the job.  I can replace my hard drive in my home computer, and add memory, this takes allot more skill.  If you have the skill, the tools are great and very complete.  I had everything the video said I needed, minus the skill.",positive
very helpful and good quality,positive
"I rate this 5 stars. Love this product! great price and quality. Love how it works with my iphone 4. And it comes with a lot of tools which is great, in case you misplace one of them.",positive
It has a lot of what I need to do basic repairs on a phone but it is bare bones.,positive
Could have been better for the price and wait time. 2 of the drivers are labeled as a 1.5 but are clearly different sizes. Also the wear kinda fast if working with tight screws,positive
Very fast delivery.  product is as described and useful tool.  If  you need a set of these this is a good one,positive
I use these mostly for electronics repair and they get they job done. Great for phone repair or and small electronics.,positive
"You may not need these types of screwdrivers often, but when you do need them, nothing else will do.  They're great for tightening eyeglass screws or opening up the cases of small electronic devices.This is a nice set.  It comes with 4 slotted and 2 philips style in a variety of sizes. They seem to be well made and I suspect that they last a long time. The swivel heads allow you to put downward pressure on the screwdriver as you turn it to minimize the risk of stripping the head on delicate small screws. The case has a labeled space for each screwdriver. It's your typical plastic case with a snap top and should hold up as long as you don't step on it or drop something on it.  This set is a nice value for the price.",positive
"It is chinesse(like almost everything in this world LOL) but they are really well done, and for the price they are a bargain.The screw drivers have a free rolling top to make pressure, and the body is rellay good, nice grip and 3 lobules ergonomics.The pliers are just as good as you can get, no problems with them and good finish on the edges, not like razors like othersthe prying tool is just what you need for almost any device you want to tear apart(besides the iPad) they have enough strenght to pry out plastics and even aluminun bodys of smartphones.There is to mini screwdriver, a flat an a phillips, I use them for electronics.Overall pretty satisfied, I would buy another one later on",positive
Really poor quality tweezer bent like nothing screw drivers made of cheap plastic adhesive removing tool again cheap plastic you get what you pay for would not recommend to anyone who is trying to perform phone surgery,positive
"Not the best ive purchased but it came with the right size for iphone 4 but the ones with the yellow handles are really just different sizes for a star screw, and none of them fits the iphone 4 star screw. You can always use it for another gadget though.",positive
Once or twice a month you need a smaller screwdriver than your always handy six -in-one. This setfills the bill nicely. When you need it you need it. A must have.,positive
this item came in a timely matter and fit the descrition the only thing that the plastic broke a little to easily but other than that every thing else is good,positive
"Nothing fancy but is extremely useful when you need it! love the tweezers and the big writing telling me which tool is which size. Took a while, 3-4 weeks i'd guess, but was worth the wait! I'd easily recommend them.",positive
I received it today and it doesn't charge. I'm sure it is used - I found a piece of broken iPhone glass on the contact side.,positive
"Like others have said here, the screwdriver set is solid and good quality and will last forever.  The issue of course here is that the screwdrivers are not a true jewelers set and will be too big for most jewelry/watch related tasks.  So if you are looking for that type of set, this isnt the one to use.",positive
"I needed a new screwdriver set to work on laptops with, as most of my old ones have mysteriously disappeared. At the price, there was no way I was going to beat a set of Stanleys. The best part so far, to me, is that they come already magnetized. I put them to use the day I received them, and am quite happy with them.",positive
"I purchased this battery to replace a water soaked one in an iPhone 4. I don't even know if it is charging or not as the unit won't turn on for me. The shipping is prompt, the packaging great, and the description is accurate.",positive
now I have it. I can carry it with me and always have the perfect size tool for the little things that go wrong.,positive
i have used this kit to fix a bunch of cell phones  and price is right and tools work great,positive
"I'm sure that there is something that says it will not come as pictured, but still I was disappointed.The tools helped me get the job done, but they also did not hold up well. The plastic plying tools bent and broke fairly quickly. I can't say that it wasn't user error, but they seemed very cheap.",positive
"I bought this for my wife's 2 year old iphone 4S.  She said it seemed to work about the same or a little better than the old battery.  Not a huge improvement, but an acceptable replacement  if you need a new battery.",positive
"This review is for the iPhone 5 battery and tool set. I realize now that the company is selling several different items under the same listing, so the reviews can be confusing and not accurate.Like many other &#34;power users&#34; (i.e. slaves) of their iPhones, I came to the end of the usefulness for my iPhone 5's internal battery. After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available, I went with the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff.The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece. Who knows how accurate that is, but if you're taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn't been sitting on the shelf losing it's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies.After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone. Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery.The tools worked just fine for me. I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit. Do some extra research around properly removing the battery. Use the clear plastic sheet under the battery to help lift it up and separate from the adhesive. That was the most challenging part of my battery replacement. After two months of use, I can make it through the whole day after heavy phone use without looking for a charger. My life is complete again!",positive
This is a good buy if it is what you are wanting.  I misread the product info and did not realize this is all Torx screwdrivers.,positive
This was a great deal.  Easy to install and a direct fit replacement for the iPhone 4s.  Does what it should and hopefully it will last.,positive
"I fix my own phones and Tab 3 and Mac computers (desk top and laptop), and IPad(s). So having the right tools are very important to me. The price was the thing that did it for me. Great price!!",positive
Purchased this to remove screws on my Samsung Galaxy SII but even the smallest tool in the set was too large.,positive
"Great tools, I still use them and I like the quality, great price as well.Good vendor.I would buy more.",positive
"This tool set is better than expected. The machining and finish is very good. If used for small electronics and similar applications, this set should be durable.",positive
This was a great deal for the set. High quality materials at a low price. I would recommend this product to a friend.,positive
"Tools were required for opening GPS, iPOD, etc cases. Nice selection of sizes. The plastic wedge tool is easily damaged. A five star rating if it included a case (I would have even paid extra for a case)",positive
"the Torx screwdrivers were great, the tweesers were substandard, and the spluger was very cheap, mine broke the first time i used it.  For the price you cannot expect high quality.  all in all it did the job",positive
These were a supper price and while not supper strong they will do the job and you get a lot for your money.,positive
Had a mix up with getting the item and slow shipping but it was all resolved in the end so I am satisfied with the purchase,positive
I really needed the torx driver tools to fix broken Nexus 4 back plate and this kit worked great. I'm really glad to have it around in case I need it again.,positive
"The battery worked very well! I used the screwdriver and the plastic pieces of the kit in replacement, and the tips of the spudger get bent without hard use - such as prying the old battery out. Still, a great value in a DIY kit to give new life to your tired iPhone 4S!",positive
"I tried two (yes, two) batteries and had to send both back because both were crap. I finally decided to spend a bit more hoping it would equate to more quality. Well that seems to have paid off (third time's the charm I guess). The battery itself replaced my old battery perfectly. It holds a charge well and reads the correct battery percentage. The included tools were a bonus. I already had a set of tools from replacing my wife's battery a while back. However these were much better. The old tools I had were stripping the tiny screw heads. This set of tools gripped the screw heads perfectly. Overall I'm very happy.",positive
very handy tools i mostly use it when i have to fix soomething small like phones docks and other cool stuff,positive
"very nice quality set of screwdrivers. they sell bigger sets on here for cheaper, but made by a different company. DO NOT BUY THEM. if you want a quality precision set of drivers. this is the company to go with.",positive
"the tools are ok Just not quite what I  expected.  They were, however, better than the ones that came with the screen I ordered.",positive
Got this to replace an iphone5 battery that was only useable when it was tethered. Now it holds full charge and is ready to go. Great OEM repalcement. The tools are nice enough to use again too.,positive
You get what you pay for. They strip easily. VERY cheaply made. But I only needed them for a one time use and I didn't have to spend a bunch of money so I can't really complain. But if you will need them more than once...spend the money on good tools.,positive
Good but if you plan to repair or take apart apple products this kit is completely useless and won't be worth it,positive
Was about ready to send my Jawbone Era back. Then I ordered the Jabra ear gels. Now I can wear my Jawbone all day! Aliph should include these with the Jawbone headsets. And I intend to tell them! Jawbone Era is awesome too!,positive
"I bought these eargels for my bluetooth, which happens to be a Samsung WEP200, and it fit it perfectly. Gives great comfort and a perfect fit. Comes with more than just three. Comes with a whole bunch. Highly recommended product",positive
"I bought these to use with my Jawbone Era bluetooth headset.  The Era comes with 9 different options for ear inserts.  But I always felt like the earpiece was about to fall out, unless I jammed it into my ear so far that it became uncomfortable.Enter the Jabra EarGels...  These made a huge difference.  It fit perfectly onto my ear (the nub on the top goes into the spot above the ear hole).  I could wear this all day.  I wouldn't wear these eargels without having an over-the-ear hook attachment on my Era, but these have made a huge difference for the comfort of my bluetooth earpiece.",positive
"The eargels fit to the earpiece is fine, nice and tight, but as far as actually getting ANY of the sizes to comfortably fit, FORGET IT",positive
I got these for my jawbone headset. Many had said they work great. but for the life of me i cant figure out how you get them to work short of superglue and even then they are too quiet to hear so i guess they work on the jabra they are designed for but not the jawbone.,positive
"When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic.  They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it.  Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset.  The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear.  I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so.  I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all.",positive
these were advertised to fit the habra stone.  they did not. i don't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it. not even one piece fit.  threw them away,positive
I bought these to redirect sound into the ear for my jawbone. TO that end it worked like a champ. the only issue I have is that after about a year they started to yellow. I guess that is common with these clear jelly products though.,positive
"The Jabra Eargels are wonderful.. I cannot believe how comfortable, and user friendly they are.  Thank you, if not for these, I could not use my bluetooth.Great Merchandise..",positive
"I purchased these because the original ear pieces from jabra were OK but left me pushing on my headset constantly trying to get it in my ear more.  Which, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of accidental button pushing and disconnecting calls.I saw these on Amazon and thought they were worth trying.  I loved that you get basically 6 ear gels in 3 sizes for both right and left error.I found a size that fit my ear perfectly and was able to use the headset without the earband which was a surprise.The ear gels are gentle and fit in the ear.  Only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting and finesse to get the gel on the headset.  Also, while I enjoyed the product I feel it may be slightly over priced for what you get.But overall a great product and the sound is now channelled directly into my ear so I don't have to keep pushing my headset in to hear.  I would recommend this product to others who find the jabra sound decent but also wish it would go in the ear a little more.",positive
people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential..A must have for any headset that will fit them,positive
"These Ear Gels Work Very Well, Comfort Is The Main Reason I Bought Them, Fit The Ear Very Well, The Price Was Right, You Will Not Go Wrong With These Ear Gels, That Is Why I Gave Them Five Stars",positive
Works great on ear buds. I bought these to put on my basic ear buds and have them fit more comfortable so I can wear them longer. Great for wearing in the car during long drives.,positive
I bought these so my headset would be more comfortable...These hurt your ears just like the one that comes with it no matter what size you use. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone...Don't waste your money.,positive
"Purchased the Jawbone bluetooth headset. It was just not comfortable, but with these all is great now. Could not ask for a better set of earpieces. Great use of my money to get these.",positive
"I like this Jabra earboom so much that I have purchased 6 of these so far.  And that is my biggest complaint, is their poor quality of workmanship.  They work well but just don't last.  Granted, I'm a road warrior and my earbooms probably go through more abuse than a casual user.  The reason I keep buying them is the audio quality is fantastic and the fit within my ear is solid.  I keep two spares on hand at all times so as soon as one fails I can throw it away and move on.  At this price, I can afford it.  Also, Jabra customer services is great.  I lost the windscreen for the boom mic once and an email to them got me a set of windscreens in my mailbox, no charge.",positive
"Jabra makes, by far the best hands-free devices on the market.  This particular model, the EarBoom, is not with it's faults.  However, it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it's peculiarities.Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use.  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid.  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out.  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack.  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by.  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm.  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled, you must slighly twist the microphone head.  I have found that sometimes, if it is at the wrong angle, it will not capture sound as well.  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly.I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap, which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm.  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie.  Personally I don't like those models.  I have not found much difference in sound quality, though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out.For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don't like, I have docked this unit 2 stars.  It should be noted that none of Jabra's newer models have this microphone arm any longer  But this is good bang for the buck.  Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.",positive
these are the very best quality at a AWESOME price.Save $20. over a cell phone company price.,positive
"Yeah, I know, they warned me; but I thought I was smarter than the average bear- not so.If you have auto reverse on your tape player and you cannot shut the feature off, this will not work.  It may work for a few minutes at a time, but will always end up frustrating you by switching every few minutes.If you can turn off the auto reverse (or don't have it), it's a very solid product that sounded great.For those like me who need a FM transmitter instead of the tape version, I'd suggest the Soundkase FM Transmitter for iPod & MP3s.  We've been using it for a week or 2 with good results (and from my research, probably the best results you can get if you can't use a tape connection).",positive
"Good Item, BUT.....The sound could be better...U get what u Pay For!!$8.00 for this as opposed to minimum $130 for a CHEAP CD installed in the dash.Well worth the couple of $$$",positive
Not really worth getting.Except for very limited application this is not an good way to connect a audio device to the car stereo.this item creates a bunch of mechanical noise and in addition the sound quality from the attached device is very poor. It works but is not worth listening to unless one has to.  As limited as the fm transmitters are they have significantly better sound quality.  I'd return this except it would cost more to ship than it is worth.,positive
"Great for the price.  Sound quality is not what it should be, I think, but my kids love it.  I like the idea and am going to buy one for my car, but a different brand to see if there is a difference in sound.",positive
"I was worried about having problems with the Auto Reverse, but it worked the very first time in my '05 Audi A4 with factory stereo. The sound quality isn't CD level, but then again its better than my old FM transmitter.",positive
"I tried using it with my Sansa Clip MP3 player in my Toyota MR2. The car makes a lot of noise in any case, so I'm not holding out for audio lab quality. However, the product made a quite audible (at low automobile speeds) click-click-click. I might have been able to tolerate that. However, there was also an electronic whistle increasing in frequency with the RPM of the engine. The whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player. The volume of the Coby CA-747 was ok. I hadn't thought that would be an issue until I bought a comparable Maxell cassette adapter at Long's to replace the Coby CA-747. The volume with the Maxell product was very weak, and I had to turn it way up. The Maxell didn't go click-click-click, but it whistled, too. So both the Maxell and the Coby get 1 star from me. I'm trying out the offering from Philips next...",positive
"Purchased this to try out in the workplace. Don't have access to a decent sound system, so wanted to be able to pipe some mp3s through the clunky boom boxes that are available, without having to lug around a CD case. I was very pleased to find the sound quality is excellent. Playing mp3s from a phone or player sounds more clear and louder than if I were to tune in a radio station. This model had some of the best reviews on the site, and it appears to be a good unit so far. I had to go with 5 stars because you can't beat the price for something that works this well.**Update** It has been about a couple of months so I thought I should add that this unit has worked out great so far. It gets many hours of use and delivers very clean sound. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.",positive
"I have been using this Coby CA-747 Cassette Adapter for more than 2 years to use my car stereo to play audio of my DVD-player and CD-player. Until lately, my car tape player kept rejecting it out. I thought it was broken and I was about to buy this same product from Amaonz again. While reading some other people's reviews, I bump into R. Penny's feedback on 10/26/05 about the ""skip"" mode as following:""One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some (but not all) car tape players have a ""skip"" mode. When a tape player's ""skip"" mode is active, it listens for silent portions of the tape. If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it ""hears"" sound again. If your tape player has a ""skip"" mode, be sure to cancel this mode - i.e., put the player in ""normal"" play mode. Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to ""fast forward"" over any silent portions of your audio feed.""This is exactly the problem that I was having. By turning off the ""skip"" mode of the car tape player, my car tape player does not reject the Coby Cassette Adapter anymore.Again, even if it is indeed broken, I will buy the same product again. Very good product for the money.",positive
"I bought this cassette adapter to replace my old one who's cord got ripped in half when stuck in my door. I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price.The best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled, and can be stretched to be super long (probably at least 8 feet although I have not checked) yet when no tension is applied (during normal use or storage) the cord is only about 3 feet long. This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did.I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter. I more than got my money's worth out of it.",positive
works great in my 2002 honda accord!  other adapters have either gimped the frequency range or only come out of one speaker.,positive
"Just for kicks I did a ""local order"" at 2am Monday morning because it said the package would still arrive on Monday. I didn't believe it, so I figured, ""I'll pay for that and when it doesn't arrive on time I'll get my money back for the shipping cost"" (I mean come on, it was 300 miles south of me!!).  Only 12 hours later the package had come 300 miles onto my doorstep.  That my friends is dedication to one's time commitment. Wow.As far as the product goes I love it! The plug is the stretchy spiral type so it doesn't hang around getting tangled on my feet while I'm driving.  It was way better than that last stupid cheap one I bought at best buy that the cord wore out on after 2 months.  The sound quality is really not bad once you learn how to adjust the volumes properly. Everything you should expect from a cassette adapter.In order to get the volumes adjusted for optimal sound quality (without that white noise the tape players give off), adjust your phone or other mobile music device to 75% volume and keep it there while plugged in.  From this point just use your car's volume to amplify the volume.Good luck!",positive
This item doestn work on 2001 Chevy suburban.I tried too many things to get it work but no chances anyways dual position thing is good for using with different players.,positive
"I have a cassette player in my car and wanted to be able to plug my MP3 player into it. This adapter looks like a cassette with a wire coming out of the end. It slides into my car player and when I plug it up to my mp3 player, it plays through the system with no problem. I have not had any trouble from it yet as others have written about. I went on a trip 2 weeks ago and used it for several hours. It worked great.  The wire can be changed to come out of the side or the back, depending on which way your auto player is oriented.",positive
I opened it and didn't see where the springs were.. If anybody can take a pic or describe it I will love u so much. Good product but i was getting the reel error on my tape display in my ford expedition. It makes my blackberry phone sounds great. Dislike the radio so please help me.,positive
"OMG , if u have a tape deck and need AUX use this product , it's not exspensive and sounds great and works with MP3 , CD players , phones . its got awsome sound !!! way better than a FM Transmitter !!!!!",positive
"I was using an FM modulator, but didn't like that with my iPhone, it would create feedback in the car speakers, so I decided to switch over to a cassette adapter. This one works fantastic for the price. Sound quality is fine, about what you would expect from a cassette tape. The cord can be adjusted to travel from the adapter horizontally or vertically, which is great depending on your tape deck.The only negative I found was that after a few weeks of use, it stopped working properly. My car's tape deck is an auto-reverse deck, and I have no idea why it worked perfectly for weeks, then shut down on me and stopped, but if you look at J Cristofferson's review, there are tons of comments on how to fix this. I used these instructions to open the cassette (Carefully, lifting the two screw side so as not to lose all the pieces), and removed the tape reverse assembly. Then, as stated in that review, remove the metal screw that holds in the white gear without the black band around it, putting the screw and spring back on without that single gear. Put everyhting back together, and like magic, the cassette works perfectly now, even in my auto-reverse deck.I only wish that it came designed to do this without modifying it, but trust me, opening up the tape and fixing this is so simple. Takes about 5 minutes, and I have no experience with this kind of thing whatsoever, so if I can do it, you can do it!",positive
"Pros:- Love the adjustable dual position for the cord. Most players you need to insert the cassette sideways, but I had some players before that you need to insert the cassette lengthwise. You will never go wrong with this adapter as you can feed it to your cassette player both ways.- Does not look cheap. It looks more decent than other cassette adapters I have that costs 20$- The coiled cord is great and much less clutter.  I had a cassette adapter that has a cord that was too long, it got caught under the seat and the only way to remove it is to cut it.- Sounds good too with my Ipod.Cons:- The only thing I can think of is it still makes noticeable clicking sound while in the cassette.Bought this item twice already.",positive
We have a 93 Mercedes which has a tape player that is oriented to take the tape width ways. This unit can have the input cable changed to accomodate this type of side loading tape. Sound quality is great. I did not have to modify the unit like some of the other purchasers have mentioned. Sometimes the adjustable input cable connector gets loose and just needs to be plugged in tightly.,positive
"Seems great at first. But sound is kind of shaky, almost like the magnetic head is not making good contact. Also it has a bad habit of locking up the wheels and it makes the radio think it's hit the end of the tape and will auto reverse only to find it locked again and then reverse again. It'll get stuck in this infinite loop. You have to take it out, smack it a few times to free up the wheels and then put it back in. Oh and that plug for the cable on the tape is loose as hell. pull on your device too quickly and it'll put the plug right out of the tape while its still in the deck.",positive
my car had to get used to it as it is old but after a few try's haven't had any issues with it since and it just plays the music on and on now but i will note it doesn't sound beautiful might be my cars speakers though not sure.,positive
"I would agree with the majority of the reviews. I purchased this for my car. I don't have the MP3 connection but do have a tape deck. And I wasn't thrilled with the quality of sound with the FM tuners (my brother has one for his car). There is a little bit of a clicking sound that appears once it starts playing, but with road nose and the general nose of the car, it is a non-issue...can't even hear it. The quality of the sound is not as good as if having a direct MP3 connection, but I consider it very good...(not sure it's even fair to compare). I use this primarily for audio books, and I am very happy with my purchase. I have not had to try the fix that some of the other reviewers had (something about needing to take out a pin on the inside of the cassette).I would definitely recommend!",positive
"I fixed the issues, for the time being.  I turned down the bass on my stereo.  I also made the default volume 75% on my phone.  This is the combination that worked for me.  I also left the casette in.  I figured if there was dust and other stuff in there, then i would have to let it settle.  The burn in period was about 3 days.  Afterwards it was AMAZING, the sound clarity improved so much. So don't give up, try these things. You may need to clear the dust from inside your tape player, I'm sure that may be the cause of many issues.Fix eject issue:[...]",positive
But will keep this short and sweet -Cord contains lead and must be handled regularly in a car where there is nowhere to clean your hands after touching the thing.Sound quality quickly goes downhill with crackling evident after only 5 uses.Now stuck in my dashboard player because the modular adapter broke off and the cassette will not fully eject. I am sure the husband will be griping the entire time he tries to get it unstuck.Avoid at all costs!I scanned past the negative reviews since this product had a few really positive reviews with a lot of helpful votes. Big mistake as now I have to unstick the adapter from my cassette player and try to get Amazon to take it back. (I bought 2 on clearance),positive
My car doesn't have an iPod connector so I bought this product. I have been using this for over a year now and I am very happy with it. This works amazingly well.,positive
These things are just a confidence trick. They don't do a thing. They can't do a thing. If you believe these make your phone work better then you probably find the stripes down the side of cars make them go faster too.,positive
"Come on Amazon, I can't really believe you are selling this under your own name!",positive
I gave it 3 stars because I was generously sent a bunch of these on only one order.  Otherwise I am not so sure that these work very well.  I have tried on 2 phones and the results have been inconclusive.,positive
I set my phone down on my computer desk for 10 minutes and I checked the Signal Strength on my Droid X and it read -87 dBm. After putting the Universal Cell Phone Antenna Booster on the inside of my batter cover I set my phone in the exact same spot for 10 minutes and It read -83 dBm (closer the number to zero the better the reception). So I guess it works a little bit. Check out the picture I posted of the signal strength before and after.,positive
"I've always had one of these on my phone. Had to get a new phone while on vacation and the service at my rental was terrible!!! Slapped one of these on and, I don't know if it's the power of suggestion, but my new phone works soooo much better!!!! Love these things! Recommend!!!",positive
"I bought tis booster for my phone because I needed better recepion, I tryed it and it made my phone come in a little better I would buy is product again, if fact I bought one for the whole family.",positive
"It helped me get improved signal strength for cellular (phone) communications, but does nothing to improve my Android phone's 3G data signal or WiFi data signal. I didn't expect it to and I don't think it's design to improve 3G/Wifi so if that's what you're hoping for, forget it. If you want more bars... this works very well.",positive
Order this product just to find out if it does work..and sure enough I was surprise that I get more bars reception  in my cell than I had before and the price is right.,positive
Its simply awesome. What else to say?,positive
"Contrary to what this site and T-Mobile lead me to believe, T-Mobile could not provide coverage at my home address.  This did not stop Amazon.com from selling me the phone, nor T-Mobile from transferring my existing (working) AT&amp;T number to their service (of course, this took two weeks and &gt; 10 phone calls).After receiving no reception, I called T-Mobile and was informed that they do not actually cover my area.I called AT&amp;T back, and they happily attempted to restore my account, only to find that T-Mobile refused to release the numbers.After a month of essentially no coverage from anyone, my phones are happily back on AT&amp;T where they belong.The bad news is that T-Mobile has sent me a bill for more than double the quoted monthly rate and Amazon.com has not refunded my purchase price.Even in areas where I could get coverage, the phone itself did not work well.  After pressing more than a few keys, the screen would lock up and I needed to remove the battery to reset it.Last warning:  Watch out for the charges for inbound messages--if you really dislike a T-Mobile subscriber, send them lots of text messages (free from their site)--the subscriber has to pay $0.05/message.",positive
"I've had my T610 for about 3 months now and I'm still in love with it.  I highly recommend getting a bluetooth adapter for your computer to take advantage of customizing this baby.  I've downloaded Midi files, games and photos off the web and copied them to the T610 for FREE!  No SMS charges or web site fees.  It's everything I wanted in a new cell phone.  Camera, color display, fully customizable.  It's great.  Battery life is still good.  Standby about 3 to 4 days, talk about 3 to 5 hours, maybe more.  The down side... Color display hard to see in bright daylight (but not impossible), it has frozen on me a few times, mostly with internet.  Internal antenna may not be as strong as an external,  but I usually get great reception even with only 1 bar showing (inside bldgs).  Highly recommend, might want to look into the T626 or T630 for better color display.  Go get it!",positive
"Overall, I think that it's a safe investment in a mobile phone. One sad thing about cell phones is that they improve so quickly, there's always a race to have the best.Right now, this phone is one of the best, without the 300+ pricetag. If you're paying 300 for it, you aren't getting a good deal.Clear reception, included ear piece is more comfortable than the generics that come with a phone like the R225 Samsung.Great display. Only downside is the wiping it off thing. Oils form your skin and ear show up easily on the pristine surface. Very clear pictures and nice graphics.I give it a 10 out of 10.",positive
"I've had mine for almost two months now and I'm happy with all aspects of this wonderful powerful phone.  Will definitely buy another S-E phone again in the future.  I still don't like T-Mobile's coverage and especially service support, but this phone is a star.  Some may find teh buttons a bit too small, but they are well-spaced so fine for my large hands.  Voice clarity is superb for me, and the quality/durability is great.",positive
"Now that I have used the SE T610 phone for almost 2 months with my Palm Zire 72 and HP IPAQ 4155, I must give it 5 stars for the following reasons:1) The Camera is great. The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email. Please don't judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610. I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610. But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others. The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one's PC.2) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous. I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile's unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72, HP IPAQ 4155, and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great. If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC, then this is the phone for you. Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution. I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash. Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth.3) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone. Where I go in the boroughs of Queens, Bronx, Manhatten, Brooklyn and Nassau County (with the exception of Garden City) is great.People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has. So, if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network, I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC (outside of Staten Island). However, you need to do your own due diligence and check out in advance whether this phone will perform well with your service provider in the area where you live.",positive
"the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $20.  Sony took my address and said they would, but it never showed up.Well the phone is rugged!  It's been 3-4 years and it still works.  It went through the washing machine and half the dryer.  It was submerged in a puddle for 30 minutes-  it keeeps working.The blue tooth syncs w/ my pc and tells me where to go etc.  I buy  a $25 access card every couple of months and avoid the taxes.  It's been a great little phone.",positive
"Great features - except for the phone one.  Seriously - Bluetooth, IR, good phone book features, nice color display (though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses).  However, I get much weaker signals (and call quality) on this phone vs. my previous one.  If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals, you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge, this is not the phone for you, unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone. :)",positive
"I've had my T610 + Tmobile for about a month now (So no word on the rebates yet) but as for the phone and service... I've been pretty satisfied.  I get pretty good reception everywhere... The phone is small and comfortable and everything seems to work on it without a hitch.  The camera is good enough for a cell phone... and the phone was more pleasing after I got a few new games/themes/ringtones on it via the infrared port.  The phone doesn't have all that much memory but I deleted all the predefined themes/songs/graphics (or at least all the ones it lets you), and that gave me more than enough.  It hasn't frozen on me yet (and mine came with the oldest firmware).  I heard upgrading the firmware resolves freezing issues, increases the quality/compression of the pictures, and overall makes the phone more useable... but I none of these things have affected me like others, so I haven't looked into how to upgrade it.  Unfortunately, you cant just update the firmware yourself...  Two of my friends also have the same package and are pretty happy with it.  I think most the reviews on here are just people who've had negative experiences...",positive
Good product. Quick shipment was provided by the vendor and item was exactly as described. I am Very satisfied with this purchase,positive
"This is an excellent replacement battery, it fit just fine and the price was amazing. Anyone needing to replace that old battery that won't hold a charge should totally look into getting one of these!",positive
The item is working very good. My phone does not have problem with power with this battery and me neither.,positive
"If I'd bought this battery where I bought the cell phone, it would've cost much, much more.  I didn't need a new phone - just a new battery - so instead of adding another used cell phone to the trash heap, I've recycled a used battery and kept the phone I really like!  The phone now works like new!",positive
"I bought this to try and repair a POS dash cam, even though this battery is great it was not the issue... It fit perfectly and accepted charge as it should.",positive
"Works great. I've been using this for over a year, seems to hold charge good as OEM (it is OEM)",positive
"Bought this for my wife to use with her Samsung Exclaim. For those that don't know, the device clips to your earlobe after placing the speaker in your ear. She loves being hands free now. If you want to go hands free without going the bluetooth route, get this headset. It will only work in a phone with a 2.5mm jack. Most smartphones are 3.5mm (like standard headphones).",positive
I love the compact design and fit of the ear rest. You can barely tell you are wearing this thing. The mic picks up great! Using this thing all the time now and keeping spares in the car for when bluetooth gets fussy...,positive
"This serves the purpose if you need your hands free.  You get what you pay for, but I don't need to use it very often, so it is compatible with my phone and is easy to use--not much you can mess up!  If you need one that you will use a lot, you may want to buy something more advanced, but this is a good backup and was very inexpensive.",positive
"This has to be the cheapest headset I have ever purchased, yet the best small headset ever made. It lasts forever! I only bought it for Xbox live but it works great with cell phones too. It says its made by plantronics in the description but the headset itself says verizon on the side so I'm not sure what the deal is with that but I know that it works great. So if you're looking for a nice regular headset for xbox live because the microsoft headsets break all the time or for a cell phone, buy this headset. I went ahead and bought another one before they're sold out. Try to buy from OEM planet if they got it in stock, they are the best in my opinion.",positive
"I don't know, I've always liked high-tech and loved the idea of bluetooth, even though it tends to make one look like a space alien contacting the mother ship or a blathering fool until someone notices the bluetooth unit in your ear.But I've never gotten good reception with bluetooth units or enough batter life. Don't get me started on static and wind noise.That's why for the money you can't do better than these wired units. They're lightweight, comfortable, and have ample cord length. I've ordered several, and you'd pay 3 times the price in a bog-box electronics store. Do yourself a favor, even if you do own a bluetooth, keep one of these one hand. Well worth the price.",positive
"Overall, it's a great headset for the price. Pretty amazing actually. You'll need to get a wired converter to convert the 2.5mm to 3.5mm like this one:Headset Adapter 3.5mm to 2.5mm Audio Adapter and Converter (Black) - Non-Retail Packaging. No biggie.But the curved rubber piece is really stiff and hurts my ear after about 30 minutes or less. Sometimes quite painfully.I have a dull voice and this is by far the best headset I have that helps people hear me clearly (I actually have an older version of the same headset, so I have two). No one complains they can't hear me or do they need to turn up their volume. Noise cancellation is also pretty good. Not as good as my cheap jawbone, but then people usually complain they can't hear me as well on that one. So, stay away from this if you plan to talk on the phone a while or have larger ears. Small ears may work just fine. Mine are probably about average for males. Otherwise, worth the price.",positive
It doesn't fit my phone and now I must return it. What a hassle! That's all I have to say!,positive
"I ordered this based on the rave reviews I saw for it.  I am using it with a Treo 600 and I can barely hear anything out of the ear piece, even with the spongy covering removed.",positive
"As with so many Plantronics headsets that I have owned, the problem is with the connector jack, the movement of the wire causes the headset to loose contact with the plug-in jack, which at that point they are ready for the garbage bin. When they are new they work very, very good, excellent sound quality.",positive
It's perfect for those of us who don't have smartphones or a headphone jack. Sound quality is excellent and it makes multitasking so much easier. Long wire so that you can put your phone in your pocket no problem.,positive
"This is actually a lightweight comfortable phone headset.  The problem with it is that when the phone rings and you go to pick it up, it takes a while to attach to your ear.  Also, the speaker part is covered by some foam that picks up ear wax and gets dirty extremely quickly - not an item you would want to share with someone.  Once you get past these two problems, the sound quality is good, and it is easy to wear.",positive
"This didn't work in my phone. It was rather cheap, I ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made!",positive
"Does what it is supposed to and comfortable to wear.  The only downside is there is a slight whooshing sound in the ear piece, may or may not be caused by the phone.",positive
"This item is useless.  The plug is far too small to fit my phone, despite the description that this will fit ""LG phones"".  I own the DARE and this doesn't fit.  The DARE uses the standard jack while this thing is the 2.5 mm whatever.  Who uses such a tiny plug? I've NEVER seen that size on any cell phone!  You get what you pay for.  This item is a joke.",positive
"This headset would not stay in my ear no matter how hard I tried.  I like the fact that it is small, that it sounds OK, and that the person on the line could hear me OK (not great) But I could not figure out how to keep it in my ear without holding it, which defeats the purpose of having a headset!! I ordered 4 of them, they were about $3 apiece with shipping, and the first two are buzzy and could not be used.  I would not recommend this product. I went to an over the head headset by Jensen, and am VERY pleased!",positive
It was liked so much that even when it broke the user wanted the same product as a replacement. I ordered 3.,positive
"I purchased one of these headsets many years ago and was very happy with it.  Well, my husband tried it and decided he needed it since he did a lot of driving for work.  I was very happy to see that these were still available and at a much better price than what I paid way back.I love that I can use these with my cordless phones as well as my cell phone.  I prefer the corded sets, they just seem to have a better sound quality.  I love that this earpiece fits snuggly around your lobe.  I wear glasses and this works out great.  I go between this style and one that wraps around my head, it just depends on which handset I pick up.  Highly recommend to anyone who prefers the corded headset.",positive
"well, its a easy product, but it is just I hope buy, it arrive on time and the way I waiting but it hurt my ear",positive
"More importantly, the point is that the thing that goes in your ear is a cheap, thin little foam pad that will wear out very quickly.  When mine arrived, it was in little pieces all over the inside if the plastic bag they shipped it in.  No box, no packing - not even some cheap bubble wrap and a rubber band, just chucked it into a bag.  I realize it's super cheap but it should last a month.  Is there we are at now?  I wish Amazon would be... at all selective on what they offer for sale.",positive
"Not too sure how to make it stay put, but it seems to work well.  I purchased this headset for my mother and she has not complained about it yet!",positive
"Sound was fine through the headset, however the Mic did not work at all.Waste of money and not worth returning.",positive
"I have purchased 4 different Jabra headsets, because they are the most comfortable and easy to hear with, but they have poor microphone quality. I thought I would try this model, the MX150 Flexible Boom. Again, sound quality was crap. I make a living on the phone, so others being able to hear me is very important.I have ended up getting a Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco which has worked the best so far.",positive
"I've bought about 20 of these things by now, and shared them with many friends & family, who rave about them.  It's comfortable and fits in your ear, and the sound quality (especially the noise cancellation on the mic) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know you're in the car.I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you.This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won't give you cancer.  (Ever since I got a large benign osteoma in my skull after, suspiciously, 6 months of very heavy cell phone use, I'm a bit paranoid about cell phone radiation).The jack is the smaller size (2.5 mm), which is unfortunate, as most smartphones these days are 3.5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones).  So, once I got a smartphone, I ended up buying half a dozen adapters, because I love this headset so much.",positive
"I got a pair of Plantronics-branded headsets in Verizon OEM packaging (plastic bag), each coming with a ""universal"" adapter (micro-USB male to 2.5mm female). The price was substantially the same (per unit). But there is a small issue--there are two sets of pictures on this product that represent two different units. The two on the right, with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have. Note the obvious button showing through the plastic (this one mutes, turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry, but it may do other things on other models). However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150. The other issue is color. It's not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice. From the photo, one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones, but I am not so sure. This is not exactly an item one buys for style points (it's compact, but looks bulky on the face), so it's a minor point, but it would be good to have some clarity.But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out). I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound. That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3. But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill. The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends. It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets. When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset. I have no qualms about using this one.UPDATE (9 months later): I got another of these sets for a friend but, although it fit, the phone rejected it as not compatible. It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues. But that also meant that I got an extra set. About a month ago, one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard (probably a loose contact). At less than $2 each, I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one (and I still have two more left, having spent a total of $6, including shipping). So, aside from Nokia compatibility, still no complaints.",positive
"The ony draw back to this product is that it is corded. IF they could make the same product wireless it would be Exceptional. I love it, has great sound, cofortable in my ear and it plays the different ringtones i have for callers so i can know whos callings.",positive
"Bought this as a gift. Didnt get much feedback from the giftee. But I';m sure its working fine. Price was good, not much else to comment on.",positive
I have an old style flip phone which uses 2.5mm plugs. This works well by being clipped to my ear and I can use it to chat hands free.,positive
No problems connecting to my pre-existing phone at work.  Ear loops not the most comfortable so I have ordered the behind the head neckband (Plantronics 64397-01 Neckband for CS50/M3000) (waiting for delivery).  Highly recommended headset regardless!,positive
Like most people I have owned multiple styles of headsets and had varying degrees of success with them.  This Plantronics CS50 is simply the best unit I have ever used.  The unit worked my desktop phone answering system in my office.  I was on the phone every day and for 6 hours or more on a rough day.I got tired of holding a phone to my ear in the office for hours and being 50 feet away from my desk and missing the important call I was waiting for. This device solved both problems.  The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control.  It gave me remote ring detection and allowed me to be up to 300 feet away from my desk and catch that important call.  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch.I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease.  The sound going both ways was excellent and I never had an issue with the unit.  Other designs I had tried were not always clear and people would complain that they could not hear me.  Not with this unit.  The noise cancelling mike and the cushioned ear piece made for excellent communication and comfortable wearing for long hours during the day.The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty.  The headset is extremely light and comfortable and the phone transmission is digitally encrypted for security and privacy.  This is the first tool I would buy if I were setting up a new office today.  It is great!,positive
Very clear transmission of calls both incoming and outgoing.  Easy integration with current phone system. I would buy again if needed.,positive
"I took one start off, because I think that these headsets should be ~100 or less for what we are getting, and this one was the best deal that I could find! The plastic housing on the charger unit could be sturdier f they are going to charge consumers these prices for must haves items like this.That being said, this is my first day using it and I have a 12 hour conference call at work, so I may edit my review later. I am impressed so far. The setup was super easy. I plugged it into my VoIP phone and away I went! There was something in the description about &#34;USB,&#34; but this unit is hooks up to the phones headset port via a regular old telephone jacks input. There is not USB on this model. The company does make a USB model, but this is not it. I called Amazon to confirm that before I ordered it and the rep looked it up for me, he was very helpful.I am using the mute feature now, and I like how it beeps every so often to remind me that I am muted. I can go about my business here without the person on the other end hearing everything that I do, but I can still hear what is being said on the other end.Overall I would say if you are on the phone all day, or work from home like I do, get one!",positive
"I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers.  One tried to get it to work, and finally gave up.  She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call.  I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback, but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset.I have been using the headset she had problems with, and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback.One of the five just quit working this week.Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me.I will try a different kind next time...if there is a next time.",positive
Mine died and I needed a new one. Works perfect just like my old one. Good product would recommend to anyone.,positive
"I've had this headset for many years (at least 5+, but I can't remember exactly when I got it).  I am giving it 4 stars for:-simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky.  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge.  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset.-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset.  I've looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don't believe there is way to avoid this.  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but......on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option.  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again.  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking ""talk me off speaker phone"", and I have to explain to them that I can't.Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models.  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review.One thing to keep in mind.....know what you are getting with this.  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls.  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I've never had one, so I can't comment on them.  I've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research.  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i.e. one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can't just tap to talk or tap to end the call.  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset.  If you have a ""soft phone"" (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can't comment.  My experience is stictly in a home office environment.",positive
I bought this for my son and this is what he has to say: &#34;This is a great case and held my phone waterproof on a whole cold weekend trip. My whole pack got wet and this case kept my phone dry. I would recommend this to anyone who needs  tough waterproof case.&#34;,positive
I got this otterbox to hold my valuables at the pool this summer.  It is the perfect size for what I need and it is completely waterproof and crush proof.  I put some paper inside of it and held it under water and it was dry as a bone.  Then I had my 100 pound son stand on it and then me at nearly 200 pounds and it did not crack.,positive
"This case works great! My wife and I are taking up kayaking and we needed some way to protect our phones. I have a samsung galaxy s2, she has a blackberry bold 9000. We each put our phones in our cases and immediately plunged them into the water to test to make sure they didn't leak. They worked perfectly! My wife even flipped her kayak and that was the true test, we righted it and checked the phone, dry as can be.I recommend these, i do wish there was some padding these came with as the phones do bang around inside a bit. I'll put my own inside, but for the price I think they could have included something.",positive
The product is okay but could be better. The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time. One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed?The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not. I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife. Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy. Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs.Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane. I still have problems after I land as sometimes it need to be pried open but at least while in the air it opens fine. I am still using it but be aware that if you fly with it you may need a tool to pry it open after landing.,positive
"I have one of these filled with charging cables (both dock and lightning) for iPhones and iPads, car chargers, wall chargers and everything needed to power our mobile devices while traveling... conveniently placed and easy to grab if we're going anywhere, knowing all the while that we don't have to worry about forgetting anything or cannibalizing our cables from around the house. Keeps everything safe, secure and dry.",positive
"This phone is amazingly small and light for a camera phone; it even has a flashlight/flash. Problems the phone has that I find to be a real problem: 1. The battery life is the worst of any phone I've ever owned. It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don't use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge. 2. No voice activated dialing. I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn't sync with your computer. You can't transfer anything. I don't get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else. 6. If you buy ring tones or wallpaper, you can't back those up.I do love the phone for its size, weight and even the color, I find it easy to hold and talk with. The sound isn't the best, but it isn't bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key, the holder makes the camera come on. I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side. I've had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day, use the &quot;t-zones&quot; for a minute or two once a month, in 6 months I've taken a total of 9 photos, and transferred data twice). The battery lasted 3 days ONCE, when I was home sick and didn't use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged. I'm use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last).I also like T-Mobile. Their customer service is really good, the features they offer on their web site are great, the prices for wireless modem and wireless web are incredibility great and the national calling price plans are very good compared to what I?ve seen elsewhere. I was with AT&amp;T since they bought out L.A. Cellular. The customer service was great for years, but got so bad I?d wait on hold for hours and couldn?t get through to a person for days.",positive
"I don't want to rehash all of the stuff that's already been said about this phone. Here's something that nobody told me before I bought it: You cannot use the Infrared port on this phone to transfer data to and from it using a PC. You can use the infrared on the phone as a wireless modem for Internet connectivity (this works for me) but the EasyGPRS software provided to manage phone entries etc. does not work with Infrared. I've checked out all of the online support forums for this phone and I have not heard from anyone who has actually done this. When I called tech support they suggest that I buy their data cable (read: shell out another $70) for that purpose. It is very misleading to show this phone as being IR equipped while its use is crippled.BTW, I gave this phone 4 stars because it is still a sleek looking great phone.",positive
"..and I'm from Europe, where the phones and networks are much better than in the States. I have to say that I think Samsung currently have the best software (and I used to be a huge Nokia fan). Amazingly light, very intuitive, great audio, and just looks great. I recommend this without any reservations whatsoever.",positive
"I had the Samsung V205 and then I decided to try the E715 out. FYI to people with battery problems, with these kind of batteries, you must let it drain completely and then charge it.. kind of like building up your battery life and doing this a few times, it will improve your battery life immensely. I've been a T-Mobile customer for a while now and I stay with them because: 1) They are now no. 1 in customer service, 2) Great rate plans, 3) It works great where I need it the most!Now the additional features that the V205 didn't have that this little gadget has is:1) Caller ID pics.. although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face.2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom. And with that, it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white), negative, sepia, and sketch. Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.3)You can download games with the E715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205. Furthermore, the games are actually java with E7154) The flash can also serve as a flashlight. Which is quite useful sometimes when you don't know where you're walking and the light is pretty bright.5) Voice memo.. nuf saidOtherwise, it has the usual features. It has an alarm, calculator, calendar, to do list, MMS, SMS, you can download ringtones (which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy), as well as games and pictures. Pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone.. except you won't find bluetooth on this.Another thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background.. which is pretty cool since you won't have to press a button just to see the time... it's always lit up so you can see it well. Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there.Overall, I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really. Another great thing is that it doesn't have an annoying external antenna to get in the way so it's a good buy.",positive
"I recently moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and thought it a good time to get a new mobile phone.  A friend recommended Nextel, saying we'd use the direct connect function.  Cool.  So I ordered an i730 from Amazon.  After charging and activating and waiting the required day, I called to get my phone number.  It was a Palo Alto, CA, number!?  That's over 700 miles away!  An 11 hour drive to the next state.  No way close to a local number.  Nextel did not seem to understand or care.  &quot;It's the closest we have.&quot;  &quot;There are no 602 area code phone numbers left.&quot;  I begged for maybe a 480 number or anything that is a local call from here in Phoenix.  Nothing doing.  After a few more days and a few more calls to Nextel that went nowhere, I called Sprint (who have not been customer service stars to me in the past) and within four minutes had a local 602 Phoenix number working on my current Sprint phone.  I canceled the Nextel service.  They are charging me $35 (expected) plus $11.53 in taxes, fees and assessments &quot;we can't change&quot; for a couple of days when all I called was customer service.If you buy the phone, I hope Nextel has a local area code for you, because if they don't you are stuck for $46.53 and an Amazon return.  It was a pretty color screen though . . .",positive
"And it was pretty much worth it (if you sign the plan and get the phone for $250). Otherwise it is a little pricey. The gain was enough to make me feel good about buying it though, and my plan was up anyway so no remorse there. It's difficult to tell from this picture if your i95 is any bigger - but it is less bulky. The features are the same but a little better. And of course GPS is nize.",positive
"I've glanced at a few reviews and looked at the overall review for this phone, and think it's a little underrated.  I've had a couple weeks to try out mine, and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days, and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day.  The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.  This phone is full featured, it isn't exactly a PDA phone, but it's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA.  Great phone, if nextel services your area, you won't be disappointed.",positive
"Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone.  It's the best Nextel has offered yet, although there's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon.  If you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, Nextel is the best.  No delays like with Verizon (up to 30 seconds!) or Sprint (10 secs).  Walkie-talkie that actually works where there's coverage.  I'm a happy customer.",positive
"I don't own this phone. I own the cheaper Motorola (Nextel) i710. I have many friends who own this phone though, although a few of them have since ""downgraded"" to the i710.The main reason I chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength. the i710 consistently gets better signal the the i730 no matter which of my friends phones I compare it too. All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am, so I know its not service, it is definitely the phones.I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars. My phone gets signal in places their phones are ""Out of Service.""Now you might say that maybe my friend just has a dud phone. Well I have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from Nextel, and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's. The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone. Lots of features, solid and durable construction and good battery life. For me signal was more important that a silver case an an external screen but if you like those things the i730 is a decent phone to use.",positive
"I have to say that this is a great phone and the Nextel service is great also.As for the review from the moron from Denver You need to have used it and the service before you open your mouth and make a fool of your self.People that review something and not have a clue just goes to show that stupid people should not breed.I have had the I90c,I95cl and the i730 and the 730 is great as for a alarm buy a clock if you need a alarm.The screen is a little smaller but the brilliant color makes up for it,the sound is as good as the other phones I have had.As for service I have had every carrier that is in the state of Colorado and Nextel is the best and for any one who is thinking of Verizon for push to talk well it sould be push to wait.If you want the best this phone and service is the best.",positive
"I will not hash over the things that many other wrote in their reviews, but mainly will focus on the problems that I've had with this phone over the course of 1 year that I've had it.1) Battery life is not nearly as good as advertised - lasts about 8 hours - but I admit to be using the phone often and need to swap batteries (have an extra one in the charger) because the wire charger would not charge the phone! (another story altogether) However, my cranky old Samsung (a generation prior to e415) used to last 2 full days on an extended battery with same or greater amt of use.2) Familiar problem - phone's earpiece is too quiet.3) Software's pure crap - the phonebook is not only not intuitive, it would save phone numbers under different people's names! No, not my mistake - checked this several times, and then spoke to a sales rep who said that this does indeed occur with this phone.4) Poor reception - the said Samsung had a much better reception in buildings. And it wasn't Sprint service either - T-mobile and Sprint are equivalently bad.5) Setup - very panful to readjust setup options/ringers.Overall, I don't like this phone at all. Very poor fundamentals - but it looks cool and has a (very useless, but still cool) camera.And, judging by Motorolas of my friends (Nextel models aside), I don't think I want to own another Motorola product. When's the new Treo coming out again...?",positive
A phone which has got lots of very useful features and functions.Pros:Very Good reception. Works great inside buildings.Clear beautiful color screen and camera. One of the best out thereCons:The buttons are kind of small and needs getting used to.Little bulky if you compare it to a Samsung flip phones. But does things better than the Samsung.,positive
"The front screen went out on my S105 and T-Mobile wanted me to buy another phone since my warrenty was up.  From the deal I'm seeing on here, i wish i could have just canceled and got a new account, but thats too much effort.... anywho, my choices boiled down to getting the E105 or this v300.  I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS.She was wrong!  Navigation of this phone was a breath of fresh air!  i will say I preferred how the phone book was layed out better in the S105, but everything else is easier to use on this phone and the T-Zones is so much more functional!  I'm going to have to upgrade my plan to allow more internet usage! There also seems to be a much better seleciton of 3rd party applications and games for this phone which makes for better usability IMHO.Reception is the same as far as i can tell between the two (meaning signal strength).  Clarity is a tad better in the S105, but nothing worth chosing that over this.  If there is even the slightest background noise, they sound the same.  The S105 and this are almost identical in size, but the E105 was smaller... not a bid deal to me.Bottom line: If you are a prude about clarity and size, go with E105.  If you want more from a phone than just making calls, get the v300 (or higher).",positive
"I've been using this phone for a few months now and have had a chance to use most of the features.  Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days, but a few things are worth commenting on:-Great speakerphone.  Very loud and clear sounding, both ways.-Decent battery life.  Almost lasts a week with minimal usage; 2 days with heavier use.-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge.  Seems chronic with Motorola phones.-Nice, clear display.  A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight, but other than that, no problems.-Camera is of average quality at best.  Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper, but that's about it.-Serious annoyance: One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate.  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only.  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise.  Very short sighted.  And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed, you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone.  I could've chosen a smaller phone with a better camera, but not with a speakerphone, or with speakerphone, but not at this price.  (...)  Can't beat it on value.",positive
"First a quick confession: I do not like T-Mobile.  I had them before and hated their (lack of) coverage and bad service.That said, the v300 is a very good phone.  I won't rehash the long feature list here.  What I really like (after playing with a friend's) is the loud ringtones, the good reception (despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn), and the great styling.  This phone is not made by Motorola per se but by their Asian partner, maybe that explains the &quot;girlish&quot; styling, but it's still pretty cool.  Of course, the light weight and good battery life make it a stand-out.My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS...",positive
"This phone was purchased with the T-Mobile plan to replace a Nokia phone with AT&amp;T.  I changed phones and service because my old phone could not get reception inside of buildings.  I chose the V300 due to the external antennae.  I have had the phone for two weeks now and I have been very pleased.  The reception is a bit tinny sometimes, but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls.I text message quite frequently and the phone offers you two choices for writing your text.  The first is an intuitive text entry method where the phone guesses the words that you are trying to type and displays them on the screen for you to choose.  This method is supposed to save time, but I have not yet gotten the hang of it.  The second method is the tried and true press each button for each letter method.  My only problem with the phone is that the buttons are not the same shape and are spaced apart which makes text messaging a bit trickier at first.  Plus the numbers and letters which are written on the buttons are very light and I often have to shift the angle of the phone in order just to read the buttons.  The light text might also be an issue for someone with vision problems.Overall, I would recommend this phone.  The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I think that Motorola needs to darken the text on the buttons for those users who like to text message or who have vision problems.",positive
I recently used two of the plug on a trip.  I used the one for Chile and Argentina and they both worked perfectly.  I would recommend this set.,positive
They look cheap but work great. I took these on a trip to China and had no problems at all.,positive
"UPDATE:The person actually using these adapters (an 80 year old grandma) just reported from Bassano Italy that they worked just find and she charged her phone with no issues. So if a octogenarian can deal with something, that speaks volumes to the product!In her case, she was using an iPhone overseas, so any issues of power converters were moot. All she had to do was plug the US style plug into the adapter. Even so, it did work for her and she did it on her own. So that is a plus!**********************************These little adaptors look like they are well made and the price was right.i will add more when I get back!",positive
Bought this for a trip to Europe (Netherlands) and it worked perfectly without any kinks. I am quite pleased with my purchase.,positive
"I was happy with this purchase. Just returned from a Europe trip where I used this to convert and charge my electronics (Iphone, Ipad 3) and was very impressed.I was concerned it might fry my Ipad 3, but I was assured by an Italian gentleman in an electronics store, that it would be just fine, and it was!So I recommend this.",positive
"I bought this set of adapters specifically for a trip to Europe. There are two different Europe plugs, I took them both, and they both worked everywhere I went.I used the adapters primarily in Denmark and Norway, they worked great and gave me no problems charging iPod, iPhone, iPad, camera batteries, etc.Note that there are numbers on the plugs, the numbers correspond to the cardboard insert to let you know where to use the plugs. It would be better if the plugs themselves had that information on them, but at least they have the numbers (which I didn't see at first so I put my own numbers on them).I will undoubtedly keep using the adapters on future trips, and I'll keep this updated.Update:Have also now used in Thailand, worked great.",positive
"Works as it is supposed to, lightweight, compact, and very economical.  Covers nearly every plug Ive ever needed in Asian except for India.",positive
"A few months ago, Sabrent sent me several samples of car inverters to try out, and I have been pleased with all of them so far. This review is my honest opinion.As I have mentioned in a previous review, these power inverters are not new and have been around for many years. Still, with mobile devices spreading like chicken-pox at a kindergarten, I have seen an upsurge in the amount of USB-charging inverters on the market. This particular charger offers dual USB charging (1A and 2.1A ports) as well as a standard power socket. Let's cut to the chase: this inverter functions excellently.Form is the only area I have to take issue, and it's not Sabrent's fault. My 2003 Subaru Outback has the AUX power (cigarette lighter) low down on the console, right behind the shifter, and with this inverter plugged in it's actually quite dangerous for me to have USB cables sticking out. If you're in the same boat as me, I highly suggest another inverter from Sabrent, also 150W:Half a star was taken off for the bulkiness of this product, another half star was taken off because I find the LED to be too bright and rather distracting during night-time driving.If you have the space, this is an excellent converter and a solid price.

"It's no problem charging mobile devices while you're driving, since these devices can be charged from a USB port, either built into the vehicle (newer models) or from USB chargers that fit in the vehicle's power port (aka cigarette lighter). But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider. The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U)).A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",positive
Bought this thing years ago and it hasn't stopped working. It was a little noisy but under the seat it was fine. I haven't used it recently because not needing it.,positive
"A very nice power inverter, especially for the price. Just be aware of the wattage required for what you're trying to run. I purchased this intending to operate a coffee pot, with no result. After doing some research I find a coffee maker needs somewhere around 1000 watts to run.",positive
"I'm standing in a room with a TV blasting, just 10 feet away.  Talking to Hertz reservations - they tell me (a) my voice is the clearest one that they have heard all day and (b) they don't hear the TV at all.  I replace this unit with my old earphone.  ""Now your voice sounds muffled"", he said, ""and I hear that TV now loud and clear"".I have other stories like this.  Walking down a busy noisy street - the Etymonic makes my voice clear and there is no noise of traffic or wind.  My old earphone almost seems to exaggerate the background noise.I use the foam ear piece and it is very comfortable and stays in place.  I don't like the hard plastic ear pieces.Nice.",positive
"I started using this headset two days ago.  Sound is good.  You can speak at a normal volume level and you will be heard.  I don't use it outside though.  The earplug does give you a sense of being underwater, the way it blocks your whole ear canal.  But that's how it blocks out noise.  I do think for the money there should be some sort of volume/mute control on the cable.  But, I knew there wasn't when I bought it.  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I'm not comfortable doing that.  It's sensitive equipment, with a filter in the earpiece that I know I'll have to change eventually hence the included tool for same, then it shouldn't be left in the open to collect dust.  Why not give a case that accomodates it and its accessories?UPDATE 4/30/08:  After months of using this headset, I have to say I find it mildly annoying.  You feel like you're hearing something under water, because the thing is so jammed in your ear (it's a little bit violating...).  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset.  I really bought it because it was so hard to find a headset compatible with my AT&T; 8525.",positive
"The sound of this headset is excellent, as advertised.  The trouble is in getting it to stay in place when I move around.  I'm not talking about playing tennis here, I'm talking about driving the car, and having the boom slowly swing downwards away from my mouth.  The ear plug stays in place, and I can still hear, but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I'm talking with can't hear me so well.  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics, the one the hooks behind your ear lobe, but that one is not noise-canceling, so I can't hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car.  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me, and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out.  This one is better in that it stays in my ear, but having the boom pivot away from my mouth is a real problem.  I tried bending it so it hangs down from my ear and then swings forward to my mouth, but the center of gravity still tries to swing to the lowest point, so I'd not a boom twice as long as this for that plan to really work.",positive
"As you can see by the picture, this device has merely an ear canal insert and the microphone and cord just dangle.  It feels a little awkward to me, although if you're not moving it does stay in as long as you've ""pulled your ear back"" while inserting it, which creates a clamp effect between your ear canal and the rubber insert.  The earset itself is light enough to work this way.  The problem is the cable, which drags, gets bumped by clothing, etc, and jiggles things.  You have to clip the cable to your collar for sure, it's not optional like with over-the-ear headsets.  It comes with a little Y-shaped adapter which lets you use it with SKYPE or other PC-based systems.  Interestingly, while this works fine, the earset has a little whistle-y electronic noise with Etymotic that I don't hear (no matter how close I listen) with some other earsets I have.  It's not noticeable once a conversation starts. Overall, for most use, I don't find it's much better than a couple $7 dollar over-the-ear earsets Radio Shack used to stock (no longer do).  It may be, as someone reported, it's way better for wind noise, I haven't tried that.  It comes with a couple fluffy black sponge wind masks for the mike bulb.",positive
"This is by far the best wired or wireless headset I've ever used (over a dozen). It comes with a the headset, a medium length cord with 2.5mm plug, a small and large windscreen, and a 2.5mm-line in/ line out adapter for your PC and a carry case, plus 3 different sized earplugs and a cleaning tool. I use it for 4-5 hrs per day on averagePros:Very high quality speaker. Like high quality headphones, if you phone has good signal it sounds great, but you'll hear lots of distortion with a poor signal. I use it with a blackberry 9650 and a femtocell - it is sounds as good as a high quality landline. It didn't sound as good with HTC and Samsung (CDMA) phones, but this is indicative of the quality of the phone's voice circuitry.Great noise cancelling microphone - with the windscreen on, you can use it outdoors even in strong wind (20 mph). Background noise is very muted and callers are usually amazed that I am on a cell.Works with glasses and hats - unit is held in place by friction. It's light enough so it works well. This makes it great for outdoor activities.Cord is perfect length and is designed to work with the phone on a belt clip or pants pocket. Form factor is great and it takes little space.Surprisingly, friction alone holds the unit in place. It is pretty durable too (sitting on it or dropping it)Cheap - for $35, it performs much better than the Jawbone/Plantronics bluetooth variety without the radiation risk and outperforms high end corded headsets too (call center sets, theBoom)Cons:2.5mm plug. Every modern smartphone uses 3.5mm. Time for an update.Uncomfortable and itchy after extended (4-5 hrs) use. The plugs are made of soft plastic so you need to air out your ear after a few hours (no discomfort then)",positive
"I have a BlueParrott, but I keep forgetting to turn bluetooth on, or it is paired with something else so I've been wishing for a wired headset with noise cancelling ability for a long while.  This is it.On my motorcycle you can't hear the engine, and with the windscreen it is good at low speeds (sans windshield - at 30 mph the smaller windscreen starts letting noise through.  You can't hear my stereo blaring.  I would say it is just slightly less able than the BlueParrot - but that might be because the boom doesn't quite reach the corner of my mouth.  But I only have problems if the noise is coming in at just the right angle.It has an isolating insert so it blocks out external noise (you might need an earplug for the other ear in really noisy environments).A few nits:They should have cases for the windscreens - they tend to get squished.  A stereo or dual mono version would be welcome.  The boom could be a bit longer.Only negative is they don't include an iPod/Blackberry/(some)Android 4 conductor 3.5mm adapter, but I already have several.  They have a VoIP adapter.So maybe not perfect, but this is way beyond all the other ""handsfree"" wired headsets I have used, and it isn't that expensive for what it does.",positive
This usb port is sleek and functional. It is plug and play. It even come with its own power supply in case you have power hungry peripherals. Even though it works fine for me without its own power supply I chose to use it as recommended by the manufacturer. It comes with a lifetime warranty. I have a CyperPower UPS that has been very reliable and I expect this little Cyber wonder to be nothing less.,positive
"Over 100 reviews all rate theCyberPower High-Speed 7-Port USB Huba good to excellent product for adding usb devices to your PC, Mac; desktop or laptop.  I don't disagree. I think it works as promised, and is well-built by a reputable company that backs its product with a lifetime warranty. I like the solid base and the layout of the device. It's powered (AC) and adds 7-ports to all my computers with plug-and-play compatibility. No driver disc or software to mess with is great.  Mine is already full and it makes me wonder why I waited so long to get it; swapping things out instead of using a hub.So what's wrong with it?  I give this product a 4-star rating only because I can't shut off the blue power light, which is so bright, it illuminates my home office as well as any night-light! Since the room doubles as our guest room, it would be great to be able to shut off that light without unplugging the device.",positive
"I had more USB adapters then I knew what to do with.  Enter the cyberpower 7 port hub... I am very pleased with it.  I'm not a techy, just an every day computer user.  I use my hub with my iMAC and it works seamlessly, have had no issues.  I bought another for a friend and she is pleased as well.  Like I said, it does what it says it will do with little effort, and works quite well for the technically challenged.",positive
"Okay, this little guy ROCKS!  When plugged in to an outlet, it will support 2 HDDs, a external ODD, and a printer with no issues.  Also, during a move I misplaced my power cord, so I called up the company... WOW, for free, the NEXT DAY, they shipped me out a replacement.  I would DEF. buy from them again, and will use more of these as the need arises.Also, it's been quite some time now since the purchase (over a year) and it works perfectly like the day I got it.",positive
"i have use this product for 6 months it does a great job, the dlink i used on another system kept losing connection in the middle of transfers i threw it away, this one works.i use lots of usb devices and i have TWO of these on ONE computer and they work fantastic.  when i copy movies to my personal video player from my network hard drives these never fail.  the other ones would stop sending packets in the middle of a trasfer. i have 2 printers, 2 scanners, video capture, mouse, and keyboard, tv, external hard drives, 2 flash card readers, docking for sandisk mpeg player, docking for ipod player, external game system for updating firmware, wacom drawing board for adobe cs3, and other attachments i hook on and off.  these hubs always works.downside, ive had to learn the tricks of windows xp on keeping track of drive letters and changing them around, there are third party programs that i have tried but i'd rather use disk manager and do it myself.you will need to do a little cable management because the unit is small and the volume of cables attached to it can physically push it around, but some cable ties or electrical take easily takes care of the problem.",positive
"I really like this hub.  I have an Acer One Netbook, and I use this hub to power my cd/dvd external drive, my laptop cooler pad, and my 1tb external hard drive.  My cooler pad also has a few usb ports, and I have a 4-in-1 memory card reader plugged into that.  Everything works fine.  Sometimes I have to unplug my cd/dvd drive to get the netbook to read it properly.  I had that same problem with another hub though, so I think it's the drive.  It works more often with this hub than with my other though.This is very small.  The main picture makes it look huge, but it's really palm sized. I took it with me on vacation, and it fit just fine in the carry-on.  You don't need to keep the stand on it.I also like the one port in the front for when I need to plug in a usb drive.",positive
"I use this hub with my Mac and it is great. I just plugged into my USB port on my MacBook Pro and have never had a problem with it. You can optionally power the device with the included AC Adapter, which lights up a bunch of green lights and one brilliant blue light at the top of the green lights. This blue light is extremely bright for its size and may need to be covered if you are sleeping in the same room with it. I have plenty of open slots for additional devices. If you are using this device vertically in the stand there is a front USB slot for you to attach your flash drive without any effort. Everything (at least with a Mac) is recognized and ready to go once it is plugged in. I would highly recommend this hub - you can't find anything as nice for the price that is powered.",positive
"I have an older computer with ony 4 usb ports and a laptop with 2 usb ports. I have 4  external drives and a printer and various other devices that require usb, and all i have to do is disconnect it from one computer and plug it into the other and everything Works great. As far as small flash drives that require external power i have no idea.  hope some reviewer will elaborate on that.  In any case its well worth the money.  It stays forever lit, and thats okay.  It will look funny 10 years from now when the lights are extinguished.",positive
"Great hub.  it's a plug in, which is actually a plus because it came power larger items too.  I have not had any dead usb ports.",positive
"This little hub seems to be the only brand that does not blow out its ports.  Terrific for dental OP's running digital equipment.  Provides a local hub source for on top of the cabinet when the computer is located underneath.  Easy access, works well and very inexpensive.  Be sure to use the same port for the camera and the same port for the digital x ray sensor and label the ports.",positive
"Because of proliferation of USB based products, the USB hub is now more neccessary than ever. If you have multiple USB based devices (printers, keyboard, mouse, flash storage, USB speakers, iphone/ipod jack etc) and want to consolidate all your devices into a one single hub, then this hub does its job well.This devices works equally well both in Windows (Vista) and Mac OS (Leopard and Snow Leopard).It is about half the size of a medium sized hand.Each USB port has its own dedicated LED light. The LED light indicators, however, are little brighter than I would like. It MAY bother those who are extremely light sensitive while sleeping. But a cheap way to alleviate such a problem would be to cover the LED lights with tape.I used this device as a hub for all my USB devices for my MacBook Pro (2009) and the device works flawlessly, including for my USB speakers.",positive
"I use this on my MacBook so I can connect several items at the same time including a USB keyboard and optical mouse, my iPad and iPhone, a webcam, an external hard drive and even a light o Rama controller for my Christmas lights. This thing works great and provides plenty of power for all devices. I haven't seen any slowness in my webcam, iPad/iPhone syncing or even copying large movies to my external hard drive. This guy works great and I am not at all disappointed in performance. I am however a bit disappointed in the design. This has to sit on the corner of my desk and i need plenty of room on both sides to allow the USB cables to plug in. I would have had them design it like a tower with the plugs all on the back one on top of another. That being said, the current design does offer some added stability to keep the hub from falling over. Overall a great performer and a decent design.",positive
"Does what it's meant to do, the light in the front seems like their only for looks, their always on. Bought this for my Magic Jack, always hearing an echo & the call ID doesn't always work. Echo seems to be fixed now, but still have problems with the caller ID. I also use it for charging my PS3 Sony bluetooth headset & controllers.",positive
"I was surprised to find this excellent powered USB hub for much less money than I paid for an identicel one over three years ago. Somehow, we misplaced the power adapter so I ordered this one mainly so I could get the power adapter. The older hub still works fine so I just use the adapter so I can run USB 3.0 Hard Drives with a TV Android mini-pc. My grandson wanted the hub for his his Playstation 3 slim, which sees a lot of use. He uses it for video gaming and for a multi-media center. He accidently damaged one of the two USB ports and he was limited by having only one USB port.I gave him this hub. He is so happy with it his friends want one!",positive
"It is reliable & works well with the power adapter. But with all cables plugged in it tips easy & is far too bright for bedrooms. So for the actual function it is 5stars. But for other considerations it is about 2.5 stars. So, even though it is only USB2 (not the faster 3) I give it 3.5 stars.",positive
I bought this one based on all the good user reviews and its popularity.  I had to replace an older D-Link USB that just didn't seem to work at all on both our mac's and PC's (I had two D-Link's).  I had hoped this Hub would actually work unlike the D-Link hub and it does the job great!I bought two and hooked one up to the PC and the other to the Mac and plugged 7 devices into each.  Everything worked and I did use the power just to make sure I could charge off of it if I wanted to.  This hub works perfect and the LED's look awesome.Very happy with this product and would buy same one if I needed another USB hub.  Of course I'm sure the 3.0 versions will soon start to proliferate but until then this is a great USB hub and priced well for what you get.,positive
1. The USB ports on the sides are spaced far enough apart that I can use all the slots. And the one in front is great for the thumb drive.2. The lights are cool3. It works great4. It stands up most of the time! when I came into the office this morning it was on it's side but no biggie. I righted it and it was fine all day.The weighted base does make a difference and I think they made it as heavy as they could without taking away the portability feature.5. Did I mention it works great. My laptop had no problem going to sleep. It was instantly recognized. All the devices I've put on it have been recognized6. I don't know what one reviewer meant by it making noise. Mine is absolutely silent.7. I agree you need a scissors or knife to open the clamshell packaging no biggie.I liked it so much I bought a second one!!,positive
Easy to use.....you can see clearly by the function lights if the unit is on and if a port is active.  Have been using this now for over a year and it is still going strong.,positive
Product is as good as it was advertised. It works very well and I would very much recommend this product because it would give you more usb access to your laptop or desk top.,positive
"Problem:It seems there's always something else to plug in to a USB port on my laptop, but I've long since run out of ports for plugging.  In desperation, I bought a 4-port hub (working just fine, thank you), but I still did not have enough ports to do the job.  And the idea of daisy-chaining was not practical because my desk is already overloaded.Solution:Enter the CyberPower 7-port hub.  Space-saving solution to running out of ports.  And, with its own power supply, it's not draining power from my laptop.  Works like a charm!I did find the glow light annoying, but it's easy enough to unplug the hub when I finish working in the evening, so it's not a big issue for me.I'm a happy camper now, and I whole-heartedly recommend this hub for those who need more ports in a small space.  I should also commend Amazon for super-fast delivery.  Problem solved!P.S.  Mikey is my cat.  He likes this hub and shows it by periodically knocking it off my desk.I would prefer that Mikey didn't like it!",positive
This is an excelent USB port it has the option for it's power . Ether pluged in an A/C outlet or power from your device's nice option,positive
"A very good high quality USB hub. Windows recognizes everything you plug into this hub and, the USB ports are nice and tight.I will say in my opinion, for a USB 2.0 hub, the Cyberpower-CP-H720 is at the top of the quality hub chart. You can plug a DVD player or web cam into this thing and it will work perfectly. My only complaint is a lack of a method of securing it to a table top but I suppose double sticky tape will do just fine. The rubber base piece is removable so it can lay flat as well.",positive
This is a great hub and has been good for several months. Highly recommend and will buy it again for additional needs.,positive
"ok, so this is only a USB 2.0 hub, not a 3.0 hub, but if your computer only supports USB 2 then this is all you need. Plug count/location is as follows:Along the left and right sides (3 per side) It has 6 USB female type A receptacles (this is the bigger USB connector you normally find on a PC)On the front near the bottom, there is a 7th USB type A receptacle  (at the bottom of the unit when it's in the stand) a USB mini type A receptacle (to connect the hub to the computer)and finally on the left side there's a power input for the external power supply.I've had this hub in use for almost a year now and it's held up very well to multiple plug/unplug cycles. The blue LED at the top is unnecessary to indicate power as there are the other green LEDs for each port. I've used the plugs for keyboards, mice, HDDs and thumb drives. I've never had any problems.Overall it a solid and small hub and recommended if all you need is USB 2.0 and up to 7 plugs.",positive
"For one, this product is built very cheap. This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working...why? I'm not really sure...perhaps cheap components, and slight bending?Secondly, it does not support charging, and yet it does at the same time. If you plug in say an apple device you'll get an error, but it will charge which again does not make sense.This is not a 3.0 USB hub, it's a 2.0. Many new devices will require you to have 3.0 now or in the near future. For instance, my new webcam hates being plugged into this hub as the performance greatly drops.Lastly: Mine is just about destroyed, because of a slight drink mishap. Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than...it stops working from time to time, and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again..just very annoying.- Additional Notes: The Stand is horrible. It won't stay on, especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable. (It falls out easily, it does not snap on, it's basically just a slightly heavy stand that it ""rests"" on top of. (Useless)- It glows neon Blue. Why? I'm not sure. I like it because it matches my setup, but it's very bright, and I'd rather the ""power"" be used towards the other devices.Finally: This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time....I would get 3-4 to work...maybe.... at any given point. Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to ""not work"" entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with. This also made me think there was something wrong with my device, and wasted my time trouble shooting. (just had to switch ports) In other words...don't buy this device...get a cheaper hub with more slots, or a 3.0 hub with more features.This is cheap...",positive
"This is a really nice USB 2.0 hub. It works way better than the 7-port DLink it replaced. The LED lights are a bit bright, but for me it's not much of an issue since the hub lives down on the floor in my setup. I agree that it would be nice to be able to to turn them off though if it's too bright, just cover over them with a strip of tape-problem solved.I am impressed with this hub and would recommend it.Note-it is actually smaller than it looks in the pictures.",positive
"My my newLogitech G11 Gaming Keyboard (Black/Silver)did not work when I plugged it onto myD-Link DUB-H4 High Speed USB 2.0 4-Port Hub.  After researching a bit, I bought the CyberPower one and now the keyboard works fine.  In fact, lots of other usb things now work without being plugged directly into the computer.  I'm quite happy with it.",positive
"I needed a self powered USB 2 hub for my iMAC, and selected the CyberPower.It works as advertised and comes with its own plug-in power supply.  I can leave my Palm TX hooked to it even when the computer is off and it will charge it.  The only drawback is that the thing is loaded with eight LED's and they stay on whenever it's powered either by the computer or by its own power source.  If you have the thing in your sleeping area and are light sensitive, you'd have to unplug it.",positive
"This device is wonderful, very light weight and portable and works excellent. I purchased as a replacement USB hub for use on my laptop and very much like that you can tuck it anywhere easily. Great quality product.",positive
"I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.  The only disappointment so far has been battery life.  Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.Why is this phone so great?  Simple.  It has it all.  This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.",positive
"OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface. For example, the memory card is under the battery. The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while. This is representative of the entire phone operation. Not for the impatient.If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't. Even the instruction booklet is out of order.APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open. No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications. On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac. Me likes.The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor. I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches. I've had no problems w/ this phone.STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.As for appearance, well, that's subjective. Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'. It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung. Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big. Solid, squeak-free, large screen.MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless. First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc. Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires. Still not sure? If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/a good deal of storage as well. This is no small deal. If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier. The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850). The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia. The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas. As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness. Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors. It films 10 second video, for crying out loud. The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.GAMES - Java. Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space. In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site. There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost. The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone. If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated. A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price. Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable. It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.",positive
"Positives: Bluetooth, IR port, VGA Camera, multiple e-mail accounts, speaker phone, more programs becoming available for Symbian O/S. I use Bluetooth for wireless headset and to make the phone serve as my wireless modem.Negatives: phone too big; voice recognition worthless, low volume from ear piece, IR port weak so TV remote control programs don't work well, slow menu's and response. Get Opera browser if your phone does not come with it since the WAP browser will only frustrate you (Opera has problems on this phone, but works most of the time). T-Mobile programmed the backlight in the display to turn off after a few seconds, although Nokia made it adjustable, and T-Mobile won't fix it.",positive
"Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for. I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available. I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time. I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held. It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer. My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610. I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone. Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical. Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking. I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface. There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed. The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature. I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos. Capacity is not a problem here.4. The Build is just right. The phone is sturdy. I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever. Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it. This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome. I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth. The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary. The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phoneBesides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality. It has great upgradibility. I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net. Now that is neat. The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving. I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.Anyhow some demerits of this phone,The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use. Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds. You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone. When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me. In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied. This makes for a great phone.Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!",positive
I have been waiting to finish my 1 year contract to get this phone. i did find some bad reviews about 6600. but let me tell you folks its a awesome phone. I have a Palmone T3 and i am really having a good time with both now. neeed to try sync option soon. over all i am much satisfied. giving 4 stars cause the keys are placed little odd. thanks nokia,positive
"This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer). My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.If you hunt around the web, you will find many websites with people complaining about the lack of drivers for this phone and the cavelike silence from Nokia when asked for help.If your needs are limited to making phonecalls and taking snapshots, this phone will probably satisfy you. If you need Bluetooth, stay away.",positive
For the money these are great. I use these for a home based business and they get a years worth of abuse in a month. That being the case one will last me between 3-18 months then the wire will develop a break (normal) but at these prices I can toss the bad and replace on the cheap.,positive
"Jabra makes, by far the best hands-free devices on the market. The EarWave Boom is a good model that will satisfy 90% of people who need hands-free functionality for their cell phones.Jabra has gotten away from the full molded ear gels for this model.  I personally prefer them to the mini ear gels, but this unit fits fine in your ear with the ear wrap-around.  It's comfortable and works fine.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack. That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug. Calling this ""Universal"" is a little bit of an overstatement, but with a little research you can verify which model fits your phone.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by. Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine.  For those who experience a lot of interference or muffling, I recommend you try the version with ""Noise Cancelling.""  It's about $7 more but for certain models of phone the difference can be worth it.The Jabra EarWrap has a slightly better wraparound attachment and a slightly longer arm. For those who don't like the microphone arm, the Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie or shirt. Personally I don't like those models.I have not found much difference in sound quality between the different Jabra models.  The differences are mainly in comfort, style, and ease of use.  This product is decently priced, but I think it could be more affordable.Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.  This is a pretty good model though, definitely enough to satisfy most users.",positive
"Good, I was happy with this product.  I got tired of accidentally keeping my bluetooth earpiece in my jean pockets and sending them through the wash, so I bought this and it worked great until I bought a car that had bluetooth built-in.",positive
"I got this because I had to use a non-Bluetooth cell phone for a while and I prefer talking hands-free.PROS: Confortable.  Very good sound quality. Cheap. Fits in my ear well enough that I'm able to keep the phone volume very low and still hear just fine.CONS: Corded.I've since gotten my Bluetooth phone back, but still keep this around in case the Bluetooth has problems.",positive
Used this to replace an original with an old cell phone.  You can't beat the price and lasted years.  Thanks.,positive
"The Pros:The function and design of this headset are first rate. Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.It is small and unobtrusiveThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying ""headset signal weak - switch to handset?""The combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea.  It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers.  Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.  I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk.  If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically.  In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket.  If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons:I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is ""connected"" (from Activesync's perspective).  You will hear a constant ""crackling"" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn.  It took me a while to figure out.  You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just ""disconnect"" the BT session temporarily while talking.  This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure.  The ""hanging"" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear.  There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn't help.  This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another.  Its a shame, since it is such a nice unit, but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.BTW, I am not a midget - I am 5' 10 and weigh 160 lbs.  I have a fairly narrow face, but I think the bigger issue is that I have small earlobes.  If you have small earlobes (rather than pendulous ones) you may want to test fit this unit in a store before buying one here.  I wish I had...",positive
"I received this little gem for Christmas and now I refuse to speak into the phone itself.  This BT enabled unit is the perfect gift for anyone with a cell phone.No more complicated setups.  As soon as I turned this on, my Nokia found it, recognized it, associated it, and I was speaking into it.The battery life is great and the clarity is also dead on.Once you use this product, you too will never go back to speaking into your phone the old fashioned way.",positive
"i had heard so many good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers before i bought it, but what i didn't test out was the reception/range. i have been using a logitech mobile freedom headset for almost a year now and love it, EXCEPT for the fit. it fits horribly.this is where the BT205 shines. it fits great. it doesn't hurt. i can wear it for hours. it seems to have a ton of talk time (at least 6 hours, i would say)...but the reception just plain sucks. i don't know if it's all the electrical devices running in my apartment, but damn, i can't get more than about 5 feet away from my phone before this unit starts to get all crackly on me. you almost have to have the phone 1) within about 6 feet of you and 2) have it on the same side of your body as the jabra. basically, count on walking around with your phone in your pocket.do heed jabra's warnings about the wireless home network interfering with this device! and your microwave. and your electric fans...and running water...they all make reception horrible. i think my problem might have been the wireless home network. but c'mon people, us geeks who use bluetooth headsets are the same geeks who have wireless home networks. duh.summary:pros:*lightweight*comfortable*got a good price on ebay ($42 shipped for new)*easy to usecons:*range, range, range! this is a huge one for me. if i have to keep my phone within 6 feet of me all the time, what's the point?*too costly at $80 for what you get*everything interferes with this unit. you might as well go sit in a room with nothing in it for good reception.needless to say, it's for sale on ebay!",positive
"I've been using my Jabra headset for a couple of weeks and have been very pleased with it. I bought it primarily for use while driving. It's very comfortable to wear. It has performed extremely well in the car. At times, I've used it at home. The range of the headset is quite good, but I get more static in my apartment. From time to time, I lose connection with my phone. I suspect that it's more a problem with my phone than with the headset...I only wish that the phone would come with a charger for the car as this is where I (and perhaps most people) will use the headset. In any case, I can highly recommend the Jabra headset.",positive
"I bought 2 of these headsets (one for me and one for the girlfriend) on recommendation by my Cingular sales guy. It was either the BT250 for $80 or the Moto HS810 for $99.Not knowing too much about Bluetooth headsets at the time, I opted for the BT250. Two weeks later and I'm giddy like a kid in a candy store.It took a while to figure out how to install the headset to your ear, but I'm sure most, if not all, Bluetooth headsets share the same minor inconvenience. The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.If it's one thing I would REALLY like, then it's a replaceable [rechargeable] battery. I'd really hate to buy a new headset just because the battery will no longer hold a charge.Regardless, I have found the BT250 to be a better value than the HS810.",positive
"I owned two versions of this unit. One with the Nokia 3650 (apparently the 3650 requires a specific type as compared to some of the other BT phones) and the second one that I currently own is with the Motorola V600.This comparison will cover both Jabra units and will compare them to the Nokia HDW-2 Blutooth adapter as well as the Motorola HS-820 bluetooth adapters.The jabra unit boasts a much better design. The other two sit on the ear and feel extremely awkward. The jabra design provides a much better and more comfortable fit even with glasses on. the other two has flimsy over the ear plastic pieces that feel very out of place.I felt this unit to be relatively easier to use as compared to the other two. I had NO problems teaming either of the units with the 3650. I did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the V600.THE most important reason I wanted a BT adapter in the first place was to due to the fact that i get a phone signal in my liviing room and there is no signal at my desk in the basement which is directly under the living room. The reception was about the same for both (not use-able). I also noticed that when I went around the corner, I would lose the signal. true for all units.All in all, I would rate each one as follows on a scale from 1 to 5:Quality : jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-2.5Design: Jabra-5, Nokia-1, Motorola-1usabaility (range): Jabra-3, Nokia-3, Motorola-3usability (ease of use): Jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-3Overall: Jabra-4, Nokia-2, Motorola-2One thing i did not get to test was the battery life. Jabra did provide a good two and a half days of battery time with a single charge. i did not get to test the battery life of either Nokia or Motorola units.",positive
"Paired with a nokia 6230. Awesome headset. The battery life is pretty long. It feels really light on your ear and the sound is excellent.Some of these people must be going deaf or something because this thing can get loud. I never have the volume at max when I use this. And if this thing feels heavy on your ear, you must have ears the size of nickels. Or you're using two of them on the same ear...i don't know.Whenever I use this I sometimes forget I have them it until the unit rings... which makes me twitch because I'm not expecting a ring blasting thru my ear.I hate:-wind noise. You can't carry a conversation when you're driving with the windows down. or walking and the wind blowing in your face.-voice dialing may or may not work.-it makes my phone hang and reset. but that could be a phone problem in general.-30 feet? more like 10. 15 at best.",positive
"I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died.  Actually, I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it.  I was impressed with the advertised battery life, and took the plunge.  Shouldn't have.  While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle.  You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight.  Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it?  And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it.  So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line.  On the plus side, the sound is nice and loud in th speaker.  That's about it.  Try something else, like a bluetrek or motorola or something.  I am trying the Motorola next.  This thing is trash.",positive
"I've had this headset for about a month now and at first I was very satisfied. I like the shape, it's comfortable enough to wear all day (and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m.), and the battery lasts almost forever. The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath. The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset. The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down, and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it. So why 4 stars?My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear, this headset is totally NOT adjustable. Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual, but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear. Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely, and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me. Lest anyone wonder, I'm not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length, bending it into the appropriate shape, and taping it to the headset with electrician's tape. Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear. As a bonus, the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset, which helps hold everything in place. Problem solved, but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design?I'd still buy it, no problem there, but I can't give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is, to me, a definite oversight.",positive
"I picked up this headset the other day and I'm relatively pleased with it. Despite a few bad reviews, the sound quality is acceptable for making telephone calls and dicatation, though the sampling rate is obviously too low to listen to music with it. I easily paired it with a Sony-Ericsson t68i and my 15"" Powerbook running Mac OS X 10.3.8.My quick testing with iChat AV was positive and it seems quite usable for use with an iSight for the voice portion of a call. I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.The range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn't amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.It fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first. The multiple earpieces are also a plus. The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea, but seems to be poorly executed. It seems somewhat unstable, so I'm not sure I'd actually keep it on my belt. However, it might not be bad for riding around clipped to something inside of my backpack.All in all, it's not a bad device, though there is certainly some room for improvement. I'd probably buy it again, having used it for a little while.",positive
"The light works exactly as expected.  As long as you are using your headset then the light will indicate that you are on the phone.  I do wish that the lights were a little brighter, or possibly multicolored.  We have an individual in the office that is color blind to red, so that would have been a nice touch.Also for obvious reasons, if you are using your handset, this light is not on.  I wish that the lifter had a feature that recognized when the handset was lifted by hand.  But that is a wish, not a product defect.Overall, I am happy with this device.",positive
"Plug it in, stick it high on the wall above you, tape a Post-It ""ON PHONE WHEN LIT"" and you're done.Nobody's bothered me since!  The nice thing is even lifting the headset from the cradle activates the lights, so I can choose to avoid being disturbed even when I'm not on the phone.",positive
"If you don't have your own office and/or you have co-workers who have a tendency of indiscriminately interrupting, pointing to flashing lights will effortlessly embarrass them into not interrupting you when you are on the phone!  In my case I bought the light as a courtesy to my co-workers; I am the first one in the office to wear a headset and they were uncomfortable approaching me whenever I was wearing it.  Now there is no question whether I am on the phone or not.  Easy to install, plug into lifter and place for greatest visibility (cord is about 5 feet long, secure with screw or double stick ""squares"").",positive
"This item is awesome.  The two drawbacks are:1) The random light patterns are just weird, I wish I could set it to just one pattern, or to just blink regularly, or to just be on when the phone is engaged.2) Plantronics' website lists this as compatible with all of their wireless headsets, however it is not compatible with their CS60-USB.  So when I moved to a soft-phone, I had to give up this gem.",positive
"Easy to use and set up, works reliably, but in my workplace people walk in and see me facing away from the door, don't notice the light and start talking to me while I'm on the headset. I'd like to see Plantronics come out with a brighter or larger LED version, but otherwise, it works as advertised... now about those darn co works that don't pay attention to it, I don't know how to fix that!",positive
"Magnetic mounting is a joke.  It is guaranteed to fall over, scratch your roof and generally be a pain in the buttocks.I wish this antenna were offered with a NMO mount.  It would be very nice to mount this securely, and well worth the trouble and effort to achieve a good mechanical and electrical connection to an auto roof.",positive
"This antenna works well but the mini is better.  The main complaint is the wind whistels through the coil, so it must be set way back on the roof.  No sound from the mini dual band version and just as good reception.Update 5-28-10: Actually, the mini has much better reception",positive
The only thing was that I wish the cable was like 5 ft longer. It doesn't exactly reach where I want it to go with out an extension.,positive
"I tried a yagi antenna with my repeater, but never got a signal. I finally put this up on my metal (ground plane) roof. 2 or 3 bars inside, even though a phone outside in the same place has only 1 bar. Downgraded some because everything Wilson makes requires an adapter to plug into something else. Be sure you get the right adapter.",positive
This was definitely easy to install. It can be removed and transferred from one vehicle to another. Adds just enough gain to work great.,positive
Very please with the antenna but had to buy extra adaptor for it to fit my booster. Should have a bit more info.,positive
"This didn't do much for me. Unfortunately, it may not be the blame. Ironically, I have a home repeater system after trying a couple of quick fixes (I thought). This was an upgrade to a combination home and mobile solution I tried first before realizing the specific product to get the results I needed for my whole house solution. So in the mobile world, I'm sure this would be helpful. It is the system as a whole that needs to be configured to a need which includes area of coverage, location, type of usage, cell frequency and more. So in putting a system together, for a whole home solution, you'd be wise to call on the manufacturer rather than putting pieces together which may not 'fit' the performance or compatibility of the other components in the system.",positive
This headset was a piece of junk right out of the box. I had nothing but problems with it and threw it away after the first day.,positive
"I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now. I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones. (The early blue tooth standard isn't really as ""standard"" as one might hope!) However, it has proven rather fragile. Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch.  Did not impact usability so I didn't care.  For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger (several of my colleagues are having similar problems).  The headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked. I keep the unit in my briefcase, so I don't know why it is proving as fragile as it has.  If you can use it (or the similar HS850) with some assurance that it will not be crushed, it is a good choice.  Otherwise, I suggest looking at other designs.",positive
"On the positive side the battery life is good.The negatives I'll split into ergonomics, sound and RF performance.Ergonomics: It's secure on my big ears, but as others have mentioned that seal is nothing more than marketing and window dressing. There aren't many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all, so if you have big ears this may be for you.Sound: Received sound is weak at best, if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak, apparently, I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone, the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant, if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I'd keep looking, which is why I'm browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven't yet found a ""good"" headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks. A decent noise cancelling headset will let you talk in a normal voice while standing between the exhausts of a 1500hp tank engine.",positive
"This might be the most comfortable BlueTooth headset out thereHowever, I've been very upset with connection speeds and call volumeMost people say that they can hear me very well ----- however, the connection speeds take forever to establish ---- in addition, the call volume is simply too low to even use it regularlyI use a Treo 650 --- I've heard that this headset works excellently with Moto products - your mileage may vary.....UPDATE: I have also tried the Moto 850 ---- sadly, it is really no better than the 810 --- there are some volume improvements, but the volume is simply too low on my Treo 650 ---- I recommend the Scala 500",positive
"I have had this headset for several months now, and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life. This headset works OK, but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect, ie. no background or wind noise, and very close to handset. I do like the feature of the headset turning off, when boom mike closed because thats where the battery savings comes from. Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset, I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws.",positive
"This headset was purchased to replace TWO crappy jabra freespeaks.  This is very small, but unlike the goldlatern bluetreks or the Jabra, does not hide its mass well; it all sits right outside your ear, and in completely inconspicuous.  With my old bluetrek and even the jabra, my hair hid most of it, which for me is a plus, as I do not use Bluetooth headsets to impress people or get atttention; I don't want peoples attention and questions.Which is this headsets only drawback - it has this HUGE, BLUE ORB-LIKE LIGHT on it that takes up the whole front of the piece.  YOU WILL ATTRACT ATTENTION with this headset on.  It blinks in standby, it blinks when in operation, it blinks all the dang time.  But, if you can get passed that, it does work pretty well.  The sound is a little tinny, but pretty clear.  And unlike all my other bluetooth headsets, the headset volume only operates the headset, and doesn't link to the phone volume - this means that you have more adjustability for volume level and loudness, which is good.  The mic seems really good - no complaints from those on the other end, basically.  And the battery life isn't TOO ugly at 5 hours.  And the ear anchor could be a little more rigid and smaller for smaller ears, but it will do as long as you are not jogging around constantly.",positive
"This product appears to be a genuine original equipment Blackberry car charger.  It has the Blackberry name and logo on it.  The plate on the bottom of the cigarette lighter plug of the unit states that the electric output is 5 volts, 500mA (500 milliamperes or .5 ampere).  The plate on the wall charger packaged with a new Blackberry 8800 states that the wall charger output is 5 volts, .75 ampere.  Thus, it appears that the car charger produces two thirds the electrical charge produced by the wall charger (.5 vs. .75 amp.)This car charger is used with a Blackberry 8800 and has performed admirably and without any problems.  It costs a fraction of the price charged by AT&T; ($29.99), apparently for the same product.",positive

It works fine. I like it if I have any problems I will update you.,positive
I have been using my Blackberry Curve for almost 2 years and only 3 times have I been able to run the battery to empty in one day.

"This pad is really good it works for the porpuse that is described, obvisly of you put something really big or something too round, it is going to fall with any movement of the car, but for the phone, glases, coints, some small papers, etc. it works and is really easy to remove and replace in any part of the car board. Highly recomendable.Note: It also looks nice in black car boards.",positive
"Nice sticky pad to keep my phone and glasses from sliding across the dash when I turn. How many time have i done that when i take them off to look for a paper or phone charger when driving. Its a bad habit but so is reaching for the glasses across the car and still be driving, but no more.",positive
"I put this sticky pad on top of a cup holder cover i have on my Honda Accord 2010. I tend to put ipods or my cellphone there and whenever the car moves it slides out and falls to the car's floor. Using this sticky pad, it prevents that for me.It is easy to remove if you decide to get rid of it altogether. You don't have to stick it permanently on any part of your car.Things that don't bother me about it but should be noted.It doesn't stay on the cover that well.Its like it could fall off if there was enough dust between it and the cover.Just like any other sticky thingie, this thing can easily collect dust. It looks like you can just wash it off though. I haven't tried.Update:Yep you can just pull it off, wash it, dry it properly (overnight) and put it back where it was.I bought a 2nd one so that I can put stuff on the dashboard now. So I can use the cupholder.",positive
"Item was purchased for spouse.  Was not what he really wanted, but the item does work for the most part.",positive
"I always have triable keeping my phone from moving when in my sports car. I like to keep my phone close to my hands and this sticky pad allows me to do exactly that even when I make a sharp turn. The phone alway stays in place. If it gets a bit dusty, you can wash it and is as good as new again.",positive
"Works as advertised.  It's a tacky pad that is non-adhesive and keeps stuff from sliding around on the dashboard.  Problem with the iPhone (4S) is that the back is a flat panel of Gorilla Glass and does not lift easily off the Sticky Pad.  Instead, it tends to lift the Sticky Pad off the dashboard by sticking itself to the back of the iPhone.  I'm sure the problem would be solved by using an iPhone cover, but then if I did I wouldn't need the Sticky Pad at all.",positive
I keep one of these at my office desk and one at home. It provides a great place to locate my cell phone or bluetooth stereo speaker. No clanging when I lay the items down. No strange echo vibrations from hard surfaces. AND no vibrating off the counter - which had happened before without the pad.,positive
"I bought a similar one @ a local store & was surprised how well it held my phone, my sons phone & iPod.  I pd almost $6 & it is 1/2 the size of this one.  I needed another one & it looked bigger. Wow!! It's bigger, I have a. Portable fan even on one of these!!  I loved it so much, I bought another one. WARNING.... This has NOTHING to do w/ the product itself, BUT if u use this for your phone, iPod & it's HOT outside & u have this on ur dashboard... DO NOT put your phone or iPod on it!! My phone over heated!!!! Thank goodness it ok my phone.... But u live & learn. I also keep loose change on it... Glasses... Small toys stay too!!!!  Enjoy !!",positive
"Like so many other reviewers, I had this Think Outside Stowaway ""collecting dust"" as I had bought it for an older phone.  I was actually looking on Amazon for a foldable keyboard and came across this and these reviews.  So I found my Stowaway (quicker than I thought I might!), did not load the software that came with it (as the instructions tell you to do), but just decided to see if it would sync with my Playbook.  First, of course, I had to put 2 AAA batteries in it and, VOILA, it worked!!!  I am a happy camper!!!  As another reviewer said, it is surprising that some other manufacturer hasn't continued this concept in folding keyboards.",positive
I just paired this with my Hisense Sero Pro and it works great. I've tried many portable keyboards but none with this build quality and keyboard comfort. Truly feels like a real keyboard that folds up small. The stand holds my 7 inch tablet well. No more lugging around my laptop. This is all I need.,positive
"I bought this keyboard when it was first released back in 2005 took it out today to test it with the idea of selling it. But after installing it on my current device (Verizon XV6800 running Windows Mobile 6.1), I decided I liked it too much to sell. I forgot how much I liked this keyboard. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of two annoyances:1. The numbers are accessible only through function keys - a bit of a pain. I would have preferred another row of keys. It wouldn't have added that much size or weight.2. When the keyboard is open, it's supported in the middle by what becomes the case and the ends extend on either side like wings. If you are a slow typist, this is fine. But I'm a fast typist and I tend to hit the the keys pretty hard so the keyboard tips from side to side when I type. Really irritating. I fixed this by making two little supports from stacked cardboard glued together. I stick these under the ""wings"" and that solves the problem.Here's where I got the latest driver released for the device (it's no longer supported by iGO):[...]This driver is for Windows Mobile 5, but it works on my Mobile 6.1 device. :)You MUST install the driver in MAIN MEMORY - not a storage card. If you install it on a storage card, it won't work.After I installed the driver, the configuration utility suggested that I upgrade the keyboard's firmware. I thought this wouldn't work since the keyboard is no longer supported by iGO, but to my surprise, it did - my firmware was updated from 1.1 to 1.2.The previous reviewer said he had to use the pointing stick to send email. That's because he didn't know the keyboard shortcut for Send: Alt-S.The keyboard folds up very small and compact and it's very light-weight - not a big deal to carry it around along with my SmartPhone. No more picking at the tiny on-screen keyboard when I want to send email from my phone!",positive
"The keyboard will connect to an iphone 3GS with iOS 4 but will not reconnect automatically.I did the CTRL + LFT FN + RT FN keys and the light on the keyboard starts flashing.  Then check the bluetooth on the iphone and it discovers the keyboard.  Then when you pair it the iphone will ask you to enter a 4 digit code and press enter on the keyboard.  That part works perfectly.Then you can use the keyboard on the iPhone 3GS.  But when you close the keyboard and the bluetooth connection is broken, it will not reconnect when you open the keyboard back up.  I tried pressing keys and waiting.  I checked the bluetooth status on the iphone and it shows not connected.  No matter what I do it will not reconnect.  I have to manually re-pair the keyboard and phone to get it to work.  That makes the keyboard completely useless on the iPhone 3GS with iOS4.  There is a video posted on youtube where another person had the same problem.If anyone was able to get it to work properly with an iPhone 3GS with iOS4, please let me know how you were able to do it.",positive
"The driver for this device completely broke my Treo 650, fortunately I have Sprint's insurance plan so I was able to get a replacement Treo. I used the latest driver from the Thinkoutside website. If you have a Treo do not get this device.",positive
This is a great Bluetooth keyboard that is very compact and easy to use. It does work for Android and iDevices and has a shelf for you device to rest on so you can see the screen while you type.,positive
"The iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard is truly portable.  Running on two AA batteries, you can easily carry spares around.  Only gripe about this product is that it lacks a dedicated number row (for 1 to 0).  Else, it would be perfect.",positive
"I just love this keyboard. I've used it with my HTC and now with my unlocked iphone using BTstack Keyboard from Cydia. The only issue is that it really needs an extra row of keys. The numbers and symbols are placed on the top row of letters (where the letters QWERTYUIOP are in the keyboard). To access a number, you need to press the left function key and the corresponding letter. To type a symbol, you need to press the right function key and the corresponding letter. I work in finance and many of my annotations need numbers and symbols, like 10% for example. For that, it takes a long time. I find it easier to type ""ten pc"" instead of 10%.I'll buy a new keyboard just for that. But besides this, the keyboard is just amazing. So if you don't need your numbers and symbols too often, I really recommend it.",positive
"First off, I have had this product since 2007 and was fortunate to catch it at a great bargain!!  Since then, I have not had one problem with it except when I forget to change the batteries!I have been able to successfully pair and use this keyboard with originally a Samsung I760, then a HTC Touch Pro 2 and now my Motorola Xoom tablet.  I was surprised that I didn't even have to download drivers, it worked once I simply paired it.Not having number dedicated keys was a sacrifice but I can type memos, emails or simply work on a novel at anytime conveniently by having this portable keyboard.  The keyboard itself is very durable and has a sturdy feel when you are typing.",positive
"I purchased this product to send over to my wife who is on a trip, and complained about typing on a Blackberry. I thought I better install it before sending it after her, so I could guide her along. No PC where she is, so I tried to download as advertised. Result: Page Not Found.Company advised that since this is a discontinued item (?) they took down the support pages.This would not be an issue normally - you can install the driver from a PC.It is the principle that a company can maintain a manufacturer's description while not the web page to support the claim...You know a manufacturer is a scumbag when their feedback/survey link gives you an error message back...If any doubts read the blackberry link from the bottom of the review page, or click on the one star reviews. A shame",positive
"It seems that this keyboard acts a little like those gold fish you bring home in a plastic bag from the pet shop.  You have to put the whole bag in the tank until it acclimates to it's new surroundings.  I went from wanting to love the thing for the sheer coolness factor....to boxing it up to send back when it wouldn't sync to my Axim x50v....to giving it another chance and after it was good and ready to work flawlessly, I now love it again.  The keyboard is smaller than standard but very useable.  It's great for writing a longer e-mail, inputting contacts, or writing a letter in word, when you don't want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly.  The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap.  Pun intended. The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA.  It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don't want to let go.  The plastic it's made out of doesn't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim, et al, is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it's holding.  Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it. I previously gave it one star, but now that it's acclimated and working I give it 4 only because of the cradle shortcoming or else it would have been a full 5.  I know it shows one star, but Amazon wholdn't allow me to edit the scale.",positive
"Great sturdy design in every aspect. After pairing, it features flawless instant connection to your device every time you open it. A keeper for long, its quality shows it'll last for ages.I just wish iGO would start working on supporting Windows Mobile 6. It does perform as a keyboard should and it does carry out it's core functionality; but, I can't find the drivers for my device or any other WM6 device for that manner. I am currently using similar ones which, though do allow the device to work, don't allow all function keys to carry their purpose or softkey support to be accurate.",positive
"I have infrared (IR) keyboards to use with my Palm Treo 650 and Palm TX. They don't work very well, at least not for me. I had major problems with lag: characters I typed simply didn't make it to the screen.Taking a chance, I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very, very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway's set-up software is simple to use. Reading the short user's manual (not the brief Quick Start) is a must. The learning curve isn't steep, but because the keyboard is intended as a ""universal"" device, tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up, the keyboard performs superbly well. Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen. I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers. I needn't have worried. The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum. Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth, I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character didn't show up. I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported. At first this struck me as a design flaw, but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for. I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided. I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers. You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock. If you have to enter a lot of numeric data, the complaints are justified. On the other hand, for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry, it is an inconvenience, but not a major one. I'm happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today's products. It's plastic with some metal, but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank. On the other hand, it doesn't feel overy flimsy either. Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall, this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing. I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit. The Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard is a very slick piece of work and well worth the cost for anyone who wants to use their smartphone or PDA for typing more than a few words.",positive
"Once you get a keyboard for your pda / smart phone, you won't go back. This keyboard communicates via bluetooth and does a great job at turning your small device into a productive tool you won't want to be without. I use this keyboard with my Palm TX and it does a fabulous job during meetings - it's small (smaller than a notebook), VERY portable and reliable. the entire keyboard as well as my Palm PDA fits into the pant pocket of my cargo pants / shorts. You really can't get much more portable than that.To use you invoke a 3-button key combination to help it initiate contact with your device. Once connected, you'll be off and running. My Palm TX will only stay on at 1-3 minute intervals so the only thing I don't like about this combination is that I have to keep hitting a key once in a while so my Palm doesn't shut off. This of course is a design flaw of the TX and not reflective of the keyboard.",positive
"This keyboard fills my left pocket and my ""Ultra mobile PC phone"" fills my right pocket.  This keyboard allows me to type at normal speed on a device I can keep in my pocket, and I was astonished to see that it would have even worked for text messaging on my older phone, the Nokia N-Gage.  If you have any HTC phone or any phone that supports bluetooth or this keyboard, or even a PDA, I highly recommend this product, although it is costly.  Pair it with anything that can run TextMaker Office for WindowsMobile and you have a meeting powerhouse in your pocket that can tackle the best college note taking in a much more mobile manner than a laptop, since you don't need to take it out of a bag, plug it in, and otherwise waste time.  I also suggest pairing it with the mouse by the same company for the same purpose.",positive
"I have an older PDA (Dell Axim X50) and this keyboard works great! The connection is Bluetooth and was easy to set up.  It is compact when folded up and very light, yet feels fairly sturdy and responsive when typing.",positive
The iGO bluetooth keyboard works great. The only complaint is the extreme left and right tips a little when typing.,positive
"For the money, this is a great item and a must have for mobile road warriors. I am using the iGo keyboard with a Blackberry Curve (8300).Like others have said, there is a nasty sticker that covers both the outside cover and the keys that may never completely come off. When peeling it off the keys, it feels like the keys will rip off their fragile posts.Also, as is common with Bluetooth, getting the two devices to communicate with one another can be tricky. I haven't used it a lot yet, so maybe I haven't figured out the right combination of button presses. But I hate when things don't simply ""work.""The keyboard is fairly solid and certainly easy to type on, especially if you're accustomed to typing on a laptop. The keys are marked with several shortcut functions to launch tasks or apps.This is a great item for anyone who wants a lightweight substitute for traveling with a laptop. While sitting in a hotel room checking e-mail, this is all you need.",positive
"I purchased this keyboard so that I could start doing some serious word processing on my Treo 650, and I've been absolutely pleased!First off, the keyboard does not come with the Treo 650 driver --- you must DOWNLOAD THIS DRIVER OFF OF THINK OUTSIDE'S websiteHowever, downloading the driver is easy, and from there, you can sync it to your Treo, or email it, in an attachment, to itOnce the drive is installed, the keyboard is flawless!My biggest complaint about BlueTooth keyboards is that they lag, as you type ---- but this is not the case with the Stowaway --- every key I pressed showed up INSTANTLY upon my Treo 650So far, it has worked terrificly with my address book, calendar, and email (VersaMail)In addition, the keyboard folds together well and is EXTREMELY thin and portable ---- I don't know if you could carry it in a pocket - but a backpack, briefcase, etc will not feel any extra weight with this productlastly - these keyboards are small --- I wish the delete key was bigger (as I often make typos) but nonetheless, I'm very happy, and certainly, typing on this quicker than the phone's keyboardhighly recommended!HAPPY TYPING! HAPPY BUYING!",positive
"Originally created for use with Palm devices, the iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard for PDAs and Handhelds is still among the best folding, nearly full-sized Bluetooth keyboards available. Its metal case and relatively simple folding mechanism result in a durable product that has given me years of reliable service. The keyboard feels great; the throw of the keys is nice and tactile feedback is on a par with many laptop keyboards. My fingers are none too slim and they easily fit on to this keyboard. Like many of us, these days, I'm a touch typist and I find using this keyboard as comfortable as any I might find, particularly on most laptop computers. I've owned a couple of these - not because they wear out (I still own and use the first one I purchased, nearly a decade ago) - but because I find it's useful to have one at my bedside and another in my gear bag.Powered by AAA batteries makes it easy to operate. There's no proprietary power source or charging system required. It sips power, too; I find it lasts and lasts on a pair of NiMH rechargeable batteries.Pairing with a phone or other device is very simple. However, my Symbian phones do not handle this as they should any authorized peripheral. I have to manually connect; I cannot just turn the keyboard on and start to type, in order to get the keyboard and phone to connect. I suspect this a deficiency with the Symbian OS and not with the keyboard.The folding stand is very useful and fits a variety of devices of roughly phone-size, in either a portrait or landscape configuration.Even without its zippered case, this keyboard travels very nicely and has a durable aluminum shell.Why didn't I give this a perfect 5-star rating? The keypad is available, I think, only with the functions of the old Palm OS mapped on to the keys. It doesn't undermine the use of the keyboard with other operating systems, but can sometimes be distracting that the keys are printed with functions either not available on your phone's operating system or the keys cannot actually perform that function.I find it very unfortunate that most so-called ""smart phones"" do not support mapping special functions on to Bluetooth keyboards. Admittedly, this is not a shortcoming of the keyboard itself. Phone manufacturers are simply more interested in equipping their systems with eye-candy and games, rather than the kinds of productivity enhancements which might make their devices more useful to those of us who try to rely upon them to aid is in our work and home lives.It is astonishing to me that this keyboard isn't more popular and being emulated by other manufacturers. It would be terrific if it were to ship with software that could enable iOS, Android, and Symbian devices to map functions to its keys.I highly recommend this keyboard, if you are looking for a durable, reliable, and comfortable folding Bluetooth keyboard for your handheld device.",positive
"It is so funny watching text fly into my T-Mobile SDA smartphone (aka iMate SP5m or HTC Tornado) using the Stowaway keyboard. This keyboard is all class: just like a laptop keyboard, with the same spring to the keys, quality, durability and lovely looks to boot.Entering numbers is get-used-to'able, however symbols such as () and & or % can be a major pain, due to the fact that a) you have to use ""custom"" key commands using ctrl, fn1 and fn2 buttons and b) if you are an experienced typer, you ""already know"" the ""motion"" for & or * or (), and you'll find yourself doing them! (meaning you are incorrect, on this keyboard)That said, entry is obviously very fast and natural as this is a proper keyboard, just with some multi-purposed keys requiring key combos.The only solution is to FORCE yourself through it and just do it. You will get used to it, just like you got used to fast touch-typing.Anyhow, this thing is a gem for hammering out quick SMS text messages, etc. I mean no more ""click-click-click, clack-clack, click-click-click-click, clack-clack"" to type out a single four-letter word. Nothing feels quite like that lol!This thing will fit EASILY in a purse and will fit in a men's pant pocket. I wear shorts, pants, etc. and it fits fine.The keyboard clicks are quite silent. I use this in class to quicly type out extensive class notes, as I can type far faster (and more legibly) than I can hand-write.The case is durable sandblasted aluminum (like my old minidisc player) and the detachable device stand is sweet! I use it all the time to put my phone on one of those little chair-mounted desks in class, and type in my lap. Sweet!Anyhow, is this thing essential? I mean, I kinda hate not having a notebook around when in, say, a statistics class with graphs and stuff...you can't draw graphs with this thing very well. However, for text-based notes in a college setting, this thing is well worth it. A smartphone as above and a keyboard, and you have one of THE major functions of a laptop, but without having to carry a laptop. Just the phone you'd have anyways, and this flat little thing.NOTE: if you have troubles reconnecting this thing, use the bluetooth connect on your phone first, then use the special driver provided by Think Outside to finish the connection. Two part process.In all, I am a college student and I wish I did not have to pay over $80 for this unit (why can't they make it for $30?), but in the end this thing is slightly sweeter than it's price, so it's worth it.",positive
"I struggled with trying to get this thing to work with my Blackberry 8700g for some time.  I even selected and downloaded a driver that was listed for Blackberry devices on the product web site.  After a lot of frustration, I finally got my Blackberry to pair with the keyboard, but it would still not recognize it when I tried to get it to link to it.  I contacted iGo product support and they informed me that: ""Unfortunately, we do not have a driver for that device currently.""  So, I ended up wasting a lot of time on this keyboard that is supposedly ""for Blackberry and other PDA/Handhelds.""By the way, the carton itself does not state that it works with Blackberry devices, only with Smartphones.  A fairly obscure barcode sticker on the back does indicate, in small letters, that it also works for Blackberry.  In my case, though, back it goes, which really is a shame because I like the quality of the item otherwise and I am sure I could have made good use of it.  In the mean time, I guess I'll keep looking.Lastly, I also agree with the other reviewer who vented about the stupid sticker they place on the unit.  It is glued to the keyboard and to the front surface and is quite a pain to remove.",positive
"I bought this to work with a Palm T3, years ago. They never produced good Palm drivers so it was pretty much worthless. It's been sitting in a drawer for five years and some of the keys stick, but they can be prised up with the corner of a credit card. The keyboard syncs cleanly with an iPad 2 and, if you can tolerate the way it rocks back and forth as you type, it works fine.",positive
"It always worries me when devices like this are still being sold at retail, while third party sellers are able to sell them for under what wholesale would seem to be for the stated retail price. Usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer. But sometimes that allows you to try a gadget that you otherwise might not be able to afford. And if you need the gadget for its originally designed purpose, it may well be just what you want, despite being obsolescent. It is pure speculation on my part, but I believe that the market need now requires F1-F12 keys and this device does not have them.I've considered PDA keyboards before but they always impressed me as flimsy junk, not possibly able to stand up to the rigors of travel or even more than occasional use. This one is different - I believe that if I put it in its little paddded bag it could go into my black bag and come out after 6 trips, two weeka later, in the same shape, ready to go when I needed it.  The aluminum construction seems as solid as it poaaibly can for a folding device.When I look at the support forums for the device on the manufacturer's web site, I see that people are asking about support for portable windows devices.  This keyboard has no traditional windows function keys (originally F1-F10, now (and for many years) F1-F12) [Sidebar: Why 12?  Because that is how many the IBM 3270, a special purpose mainframe terminal used by the designers had] and without those you probably can't use it effectively with windows. I paired it with my laptop, and I was able to use it as a keyboard, without special drivers.  Probably, with a great free program called anyhotkey I could get it to simulate the sending of pfks using extra non-momentary shifts, but why?  A wireless or wired full sized keyboard is what you need on a system like this.I had no trouble getting used to left (blue) function shifting for numbers and right (green) function shifting for top line punctuation, although I wish the silk screening had been against an ivory background and not the gunmetal grey one.  While it might be possible for a driver to use multiple shifts to simulate F1-F12, what then about shifted keys? If the shift to get F4 includes a chord with the alt key, how would you then type alt-F4? The only possible way I could see was if this was something that you got by pushing both blue and green shifts and the top line, but if you then accidentally hit cntl, you'd put the keyboard into pairing mode.So I believe that they are, as I write this, available at a great price for their intended market - Palm PDAs, Some Smartphones, and such. But not having function keys limits this keyboard's future, specifically Windows Mobile devices that can be used with a full Bluetooth keyboard won't be fully functional when you use this device as a keyboard.One other thing that I did was to try it with my PS3.  Works great, and the PS3 does not use F1-F12, so this is probably the perfect occasional use keyboard for the PS3 - you can text with it, or type addresses if you are surfing, or use it for naming things without having to have a full sized keyboard wired to the PS3 (or a full sized bluetooth keyboard taking up space). Nothing special, I just paired it and then typed the number the PS3 gave me on its screen.My main use for this is as a keyboard formy Palm T|X. I downloaded the drivers and synced the T|X.  I then went through setting up a secure connection. The only thing that I do not like (and I am not sure what to do about it) is that whenever I want to use the keyboard, I can't just open it up and start using it. I have to open it, go to applications, start the keyboard application, go into bluetooth configuration, tell it to connect, dismiss the warning that the keyboard has to be paired in the device list, and then do the cntl-greenFN-blueFN chord to make the keyboard discoverable. Then it connects and the keyboard works, and I can change to another application and the keyboard still works.This needs to be done often enough that I made an input area icon (the touchscreen areas that allow you to immediately bring up an application) start the keyboard app.I believe that this is an issue with the way the Palm OS works. Other systems don't seem to need this manual restart of the drivers.Once that is done, so long as the palm does not need to be reset, the keyboard will work as soon as it comes on - so long as you do not use another bluetooth device. According to the release notes, the Palm Bluetooth support can only talk to one device at a time. If the keyboard is unused, it will power down after a couple minutes. But when you touch a key, it will resume communications immediately, without going through the menu. No, it is not a full sized keyboard, and there are some compromises, but it has a really good feel, even compared to many full sized keyboards I own.When one opens the keyboard, the first thing to do is to extend the palmtop support. The little arm that the palmtop rests on is spring loaded, and pops past a stop - if you like it at that first stop, be careful to block the rest with your thumb. There is a release on one side to open the keyboard, a release on the top that holds the keyboard open and which needs to be released when you want to close it. Just go slow.There is a single feedback light.  Off? Keyboard is not connected. Fast blink? Keyboard is ready to connect. Slow blink? Keyboard is connected. Red? Low battery.Simple, easy to use, and works well. This is not a PC keyboard, and it is not a heavy stationary keyboard. For what it is sold for, it is best of breed.",positive
"I received the item in a timely manor, but the best thing about this product, was the outstanding response I received by the seller.

"Use it for my Nokia N95-3 and it works very well.A bit bulky since its not really pocketable but fits in any bags for easy transport.Great for using it on airplanes since it is small and will not take up the entire table.Some keys are very touchy since I noticed that the ""E"" button will press twice.All in all a very nice product!",positive
"I have the version designed and manufactured for Dell by Think Outside, Inc.  It is the same as this product but the keys are black.  The keyboard works great.  The keyboard folds up flat and is about 4""x6"" and it is thin.  It folds out to a full size keyboard, when opened the keyboard latches so it won't fold up when you are typing and the keys have a great feel.  Loading the software to my Axim x30 and configuring the keyboard went smoothly and although I am somewhat comfortable with technology  I am not a ""techie"" by any measure.  The bluetooth is great and there is no need to carry cables and wires and this option has worked well for me for the past two years.The only problem I have is with the stand.  The stand is made with very flimsy plastic; although the manual says that it is detachable I would recommend extreme caution. After two years of extremely careful treatment my stand broke.I don't know if Think Outside, Inc. will sell me this plastic part (I plan to contact them) but Dell does not stock or sell this part even though it is detachable; it does not take a genius to see that this part will not wear well.  After being transferred to four departments and then told to call their parts store the fifth Dell customer service representative told me to either purchase a new keyboard for $99.00 or carry my cradle around.  This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.  But if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take your cradle with you this is a problem.So this is a great product with the above exception.  As a consumer I hope that manufacturers begin to learn that when you purchase something like this you expect quality.  It should not only work well but hold up under normal use and parts should be made available and easy to find.-Feb. 21, 2006Update:  I contacted Think Outside Inc. through their website.  They sent me two replacement stands free of charge.  The customer service department was nice and I got the stands within three business days.  Great customer service!-Feb. 24, 2006Another Update:  I am still using the keyboard and it still works great and my replacement stand is holding up and I still have the extra they sent me.  I would purchase this again and I wish sellers like Dell knew to direct customers who experienced the problem I did to Think Outside for replacement parts.  They had excellent customer service unlike Dell (they wanted me to purchase another keyboard).-Sept. 15, 2006",positive

"Works great with my Moto Q.  Typing sound is annoying but easily turned off.I also caution that you should probably store the batteries uninstalled.  I put a brand new set of Duracells in it and they were dead a month later with almost no use (Just sitting in my briefcase)  I discovered this at the start of a 5 hour flight and fortunately was able to cannibalize a set from my MP3 player.  This only happened once so I can't say for sure that the keyboard sucked them dry.What really annoyed me was the ""Fold and unfold"" sticker which had some sort of industrial adhesive.  What a stupid thing to use.  It took me 25 minutes with cleaning solvent to get that darn thing off.  Also the black vinyl zippered pouch stinks like some toxic chemical.  If not for those two things I'd rate it 5 stars",positive
"Long battery life, connects quickly to phone. Phone callers can't even tell I am on a BT headset, no complaints of inablility to hear my voice will on a call. It is not for people with wide necks, does not stretch much. Can slide back when active and the earphones are not in your ears. Otherwise light, controls are easy to reach and distiguish. I have the similar LG HBS730 but prefer these due to the ease of finding the buttons you want but prefer the flexible neck of the LGs.",positive
"I have had an LG-700 for a few years, and I love it.  But I get complaints from people about the microphone picking up extraneous noises when I am on the phone in a supermarket, or working in the kitchen, so when it started to wear out, I tried this one.  Well....this does have pretty good sound, BUT, the rigid frame for the ""yoke"" is a problem for this guy with a 17.5"" neck.  And the location of the on/off switch is annoying (on the back).  Plus, whereas the LG-700 has 6 buttons, this has 4, and the buttons are sorely missed for all of the needed functions of such a headset.  I often get the ""Equalization changed"" message when I am trying to get Siri to pop up...very annoying!  On the plus side, it does seem to connect to my iPhone quickly, and the signal seems pretty stable.All in all, it is nice...but misses in a few ways.****************Update:  After 3 weeks, I returned this to Amazon.  The fit was just too annoying.  Thank you Amazon, for your great return policies!",positive
"Pros:1) Excellent call clarity and loudness both ways2) Excellent for listening to music3) Fits snugly and stays put around your neck while exercising (unlike the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730)4) Feels much better than theLG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 when in contact with your skinCons:1) Connectivity is not as good as with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730, e.g., it does not connect to 2 devices as once and you have to first disconnect it from the device it's currently connected to before it connects to a new device. The LG does not have this annoying problem.2) The power button is located all the way in the back and it's awkward and difficult to power on or off,  unlike theLG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7303) Does not vibrate when you receive a call4) Does not have easily accessible buttons like the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7305) Does not look as good as the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7306) Does not announce the battery level like the LG7) The battery life is good but subpar to the LGOverall this Bluetooth Headset offers excellent sound quality (as good as you get with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730) but overall it's very poorly and unintuitively designed compared with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 and does not have as good, seamless and versatile connectivityI've had both for about a month and the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 is clearly the better headset overall.I will be returning this one mainly because I'm tired of the problematic connectivity and the very unintuitive design.",positive
"I bought these to replace my LG headset which kept dropping audio during phone calls.  The sound quality is very good.  It has a longer range than the LG. Overall very pleased.  The software that runs the headset is not as advanced as the LG, it doesn't announce the battery level and it can only be connected to one device at a time.  When it announces it is connected, if two of your devices have bluetooth on at the same time, you don't know which one it is connected to because it does not identify the unit it is connected to.Overall, though, I like them a lot.  The sound quality is very important to me and I wear them a lot when I am listening to programs on netflix and for my day-to-day phone use.",positive
"I have been a fan of the LG HBS series since the amazingHBS-700and also own theHBS-730and the newHBS-800.With the SF500, Motorola has clearly taken a more than close look at the HBS series and attempted to improve on it. Here's how I find these two compare:- Battery life: Moto wins. This thing keeps on going, and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730. Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate (it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge, when it's much closer to 10)- Convenience and durability: Moto wins again. The Buds sit tight around your neck and don't bounce. The cords are not as fragile on the LGs, and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds. Unlike the HBS-730 and 800, the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host (the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones). That's funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy: LG wins big time. The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG, and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds; on the Buds, the same button is used for FF (one press) or REW (two presses); also, the power button on the LG is a sliding switch, whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality: I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730; mostly, they lack bass and presence.- Range: excellent, but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device, and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell. When connected to a Class 2 device (which most devices are) the range is 33ft like all other devices; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion... They're not bad, and if the LG series didn't exist they would deserve 5 stars. However, considering they're a blatant rip-off of a successful concept, it's disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series (mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy (button layout, power switch).Which one should you pick? in my opinion, the cheapest one you can find, unless you need to connect to two devices, in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls, stay away from the Buds.Recommended, but they're not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be.",positive
I was hoping for a blue tooth that will connect to more than one phone. I already had the LG and was hoping the Motorola would do better but I was let down. It is a great buy if you are only using one cell phone.,positive
The headset sounds excellent.  The earbuds will not aggravate your ears when they are in... even for long lengths of time.  I would definitely recommend these.,positive
"Update: I've been asked how they hold up with sweat (see below). No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal.  BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym.  They last from morning to night constantly connected.  I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.Edit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)The ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.And truthfully, while they aren't super stylish... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on. These look way less ridiculous than that, and really aren't that bad. Don't wear them to a job interview.",positive

My second complaint: the on/off. I have to take the headset off to access the switch. The Tone's switch is a much better setup and easily accessible. All in all, I would recommend these.

"I lost my 2-year-old LG Tone HBS-700 headset and someone else is doubtless enjoying it.The Motorola cables appeared to be more robust than the LG cables and the price point was attractive compared to the newest LG HBS-800, so I decided to take a chance.The good:- price- earbud fit- strong cables- battery life- reception- button function and placement- pairing- telephone functionThe bad:- looks goofy- the band is a tight fit- two-tone cable color may as well be illuminated with a sign that says, ""look at me!""The mediocre:- sound quality (richness and frequency response) simply cannot match the LG Tone HBS series- equalizer is not very effective (bright treble but non-existent bass)Summary:This product is inferior to the LG where it counts:  the sound.  For me, that is sufficient reason to warrant return of this product and purchase of the newest and ridiculously expensive LG Tone HBS-800.  I am returning the Motorola this week, but I will delay my purchase of the LG until the price becomes more reasonable.  In the meantime, I'll get by with a wired pair of earbuds.",positive
"My LG HBS-730 that I use for bike rides with no problem.  Recently, the route I took has a lot of interference from the near by power lines and tower.  Music from LG glitches so much that I can't enjoy my music anymore.  I also have a Plantronics BackBeat Go 2.  This one is a little bit better, but my music still glitches and break up at the area with the most interference.  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it's stored in my bike jersey back pocket, which is less than two feet from the headset.Before I try this unit, I went and try a LG HBS-750 (one user review said it has less interference).  HBS-750 was worst.  It started to break up even before I enter the interference area.I finally give this one a try.  Wow, I don't know what kind of power they use, I had three rides so far and I haven't experience one single glitch yet.  No music break up, no phone call conversation break up.  It's so nice to finally have some uninterrupted music.I problem I had was that once time, I receive a phone call and the party on the other side couldn't hear me.  I don't know if it's the other party or the headset.  The party calls me back and this time, when I press the pickup button, the headset doesn't respond with button push.The sound is very awesome as well.  I say the bass is better that the HBS-730.  The magnet is stronger as well.  I like it when I tuck the unit behind my shirt and when I am not using the ear plug and let it dangles, it naturally falls down and attached itself back to the magnet of the unit ... through my shirt.  This keep the earplug from swinging back and forth when I am not using it.  I don't know if this is by design or just accident.  Either way, it's cool.",positive
"SPOILER ALERT: this is a stupidly long review. I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because that&#8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&#8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&#8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely &#61514;  Seriously though, it&#8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&#8217;m at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren&#8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &#8220;one device at a time&#8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, I&#8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&#8217;s settings), so I don&#8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &#8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you&#8217;re interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&#8217;s page by searching for &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the &#34;flat loop&#34; design that most of them have &#8211; it looks like a great fit&#8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&#8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). I&#8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it &#8211; a great improvement over traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&#8217;m talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&#8221; collar, and can&#8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&#8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but it&#8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &#8220;Play/Pause&#8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &#8220;EQ mode changed!&#8221; but that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesn&#8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but can&#8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&#8217;t tell the difference, then I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I&#8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&#8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk, I&#8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&#8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say, don&#8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes, I&#8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &#8220;Premium HD speakers&#8221;, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&#8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &#8220;sparkle&#8221; is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then you&#8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221;, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&#8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &#8220;sweat proof&#8221;, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&#8217;t the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&#8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and I&#8217;ve never had anyone ask &#8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&#8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&#8221;, and almost didn&#8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &#8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&#8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don&#8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&#8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so it&#8217;s not visible at all while they&#8217;re being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar &#8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&#8217;ve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&#8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &#8220;a little&#8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&#8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &#8220;I&#8217;m not a lunatic, I&#8217;m just on the phone&#8221; gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don&#8217;t come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or&#8230;  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, I&#8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&#8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere, so I&#8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a &#8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&#8221;, which your phone probably isn&#8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&#8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, I&#8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&#8217;re rated at &#8220;up to 12 hours&#8221; of playback, but it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &#8211; small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&#8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&#8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &#8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&#8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says &#8220;Device 1 connected!&#8221; The voice isn&#8217;t too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&#8217;s ringtone. I think it&#8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &#8220;Ride of the Valkyries&#8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&#8217;t know what power state it&#8217;s in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets I&#8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to &#8220;pop back in&#8221;, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.So that&#8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&#8217;ve made since I got them. If you&#8217;ve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. It&#8217;s the headset I&#8217;ve been waiting quite some time for, and it&#8217;s finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and it&#8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, it&#8217;s available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130. Check these out &#8211; I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be disappointed.",positive
An excellent device works great and fits well in your ear .... truly useful while driving and when you have your phone in your pocket. Was shipped well and in time by amazon,positive
"It worked good for a few months.  Gradually, it began loosing its quality. People have trouble hearing now.  I am also getting ""static"" and cannot use very much.  Works a little better in my cell phone than Skype.  Overall, I do not reccommend it.",positive
"When I first received this product it worked well.  After a month and a half it stopped communicating with my cell phone. I called Motorola and they told me it was guaranteed for a year and to send it back to them. The model I bought is no longer sold and they have a new one out now. They told me they will replace the blue tooth. It has been over 3 weeks since I mailed it in and I have yet to hear anything. I am happy with the blue tooth technology. But I am not happy with Motorola. They have never contacted me since I called them about the prolems I was having and have not even taken the time to e-mail be they received my old one (which I know they have by my shipping receipt I got back). My blue tooth may have been a lemon but Motorola's customer service is not up where it should be. I am still waiting for a replacement to come in. In the meantime I am using the free plug-in type I received when I bought my phone.  My advice is Buy a Bluetooth, just be careful who makes it and check out their customer service.",positive
"I was very happy with my HS820 for the first 3 weeks. It was comfortable and transmission was good. UNfortunately, it was defective and stopped transmitting.  I am giving it a good rating based on the performance up until it stopped working.",positive
"It won't work with my phone. After 2 hours, I got it to connect, but it won't answer when I get calls or turn on when I want to make them. Plus there were obvious scuff marks on the device. It's made of cheap plastic and the charger has the old-fashioned two-prong adaptor. I'm going to start looking for a better device ... especially one that charges with the universal USB adaptor so I don't have to carry multiple cords with me.",positive
I just love this bluetooth headset. It was so easy to pair up with my new Sidekick 3. I did not have to do anything except charge the headset and then turn it on. Thanks again Amazon.com for providing me another great product at such a great price. The sound quality is outstanding. People on the other end just know that I am talking on a landline phone until I tell them that I am on a Bluetooth wireless headset and they are astounded. I highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for a brilliant headset at an excellent price. The Motorola HS 820 is the bomb!!!,positive
"This was my first foray into the BT department. I first had this paired to a Moto v551 then later to a RAZR v3 Silver and Black. The only shortcoming I can find is the method used to turn the unit on and off. There are times you think you have the headset turned off, but in reality you just redialed the last person called. The HS850 is a better designe here, but thats the only ""one up"" the 850 has on this headset. The volume and fitment of this 820 are much better than on the 850. I have only had 1 signal related issue and that was due to me being too far away from the phone. Overall a great buy!",positive
"a couple problems with this headset, when using it with the Treo 650 -1. it does not automatically connect when a call is received or initiated2. the volume is way too lowcheck out the Jabra JX10, Cardo Scala, or Palm Treo headset ---- there are too many great headsets out there, to settle for this onehappy shopping!",positive
"I have to think that some of the other reviewers have older phones, and therefore problems with the unit. It's my first bluetooth headset, but I couldn't be happier.P.S. People dissin' it because it doesn't work 25 feet from the phone or because it doesn't stay on your head when jogging? I guess I'm not as adventurous with my cell phone as some others...",positive
"Bought one then a second one, I'm impressed, my phone is by the same vendor and I think it is... the worst phone I've ever had, but  this headset is comfortable and works with my phone and my wife's LG faultlessly.Be aware that there is no mute button, you'll have to use the phone for that.Lasted 1/2 of a year now junk, will no longer hold a charge",positive
"I am not impressed.I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking. This device does not cancel out background noise. Listeners on the other end say I sound like I'm in a tunnel. Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one's mouth and the ""pinhole"" for the internal microphone. There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise. This is a defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking. The ""ear attachment"" and its hinge is made of flimsy plastic. As a result the fit isn't tight enough. I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing's going to fly off my head into the back seat. It's an extremely annoying distraction that you don't want to have while driving.On the good side, I don't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use.",positive
"This is my first BT headset. The main reasons I chose this one were low price, small size/weight, and having seen a couple of people use this at work.Pros:The size/weight is so small as to be unnoticeable. I find the headset very comfortable for extended periods of time. Price-wise, it was the cheapest headset from a reputable brand when I bought it. Battery life is decent, probably 3+ days, although I tend to charge it about every two days. Great for driving or any time you want your hands free but can't use speakerphone.Cons:People whom I call have complained occasionally about the sound quality. Range is not great, sometimes 10 ft causes annoying ""I am about to disconnect"" noise. Because there is only one main button that is used for everything, it is very easy to accidentally activate voice dialing, last-number redial, etc. Initial pairing with the phone was not intuitive at all: who knew you had to keep the button pressed while trying to pair up? Finally, the blinking blue light on you temple makes you look like a robot!Recommendation:This is an OK first/small/cheap BT headset. If you talk a lot on the phone, look for something else. There must be headsets out there that provide better sound quality, longer range, and have more intuitive buttons and controls.",positive
"The voice reception with this headset was just ok. Sometimes people on the other side had trouble hearing me sometimes especially when driving. I also get a tingling sensation around my ear and a mild ache in the outer part of my ear everytime I use it. It may be something to do with  the design of the head set. Research has never proved any connection between using wireless or bluetooth and the impact on your nerves/brain, and I have to believe them...It's weird though that I get always get a tingling, achy sensation if I use a cell phone continuously for more than an hour but with the bluetooth I get the same sensation in about 20 minutes. So try as I might, I cannot wear it for prolonged periods of time. After I used this headset for about 2 months it just died on me! I used to charge it once every week and never left it on the charger for long periods - only till the blue light went off to show it had finished charging. I did this as other reviewers had warned against over-charging. However, now the headset just died...after 2 months. I called Motorola and they agreed to replace it. It takes about 10-14 days from the time you send it in to get a new one. I'm waiting for the replacement to come back. Who knows how long this one will last!",positive
"It is not the ""greatest""  The sounds works fine on most calls.  it is not very good on call overseas.  people don't hear very well.  However, I am mostly satisfied with it.",positive
"This headset is actually not a bad deal but it is not a great deal either.  The design of the unit does not lend itself to easy, long-term usage.  It constantly falls off my ear and it is a power hog.  I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life (Oddly, it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty).  I am surprised that Motorola couldn't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line (the volume doesn't go up very high).  It's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great.  Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall, I like the idea of bluetooth but I haven't found a great headset yet.  I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you don't find anything else in the price range that you like, buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside:  I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife's Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset.  When I compared the two chargers, they were identical.",positive
Excellent sound quality and easy to pair. Looked just as the ad said and the shipping was right on the money.,positive
"I'm using mine with the Jabra A210 non-bluetooth phone adapter and it works fine. I've used it in the office on my cellphone (handsfree allows me to type and talk with no wires) I use it in the car and it gives me great movement without wires. Very small clips around the ear and you don't even realize its there. Very pleased with this unit. I charge it overnight and it works all day from 530am till 11pm constantly receiving calls. I've had this for a about a week and I'll leave it on this weekend to see just how long it will last before running out of gas. I'm pleased with the quality of the Microphone and Earpiece. Can't believe just how well the mic works. I can shout and whisper and the volume is constant. This is my first bluetooth earpiece and I'm happy with it ! Some calls have slight distortion, but since other calls are crystal clear, I have to believe its the cellphone connection and not the earpiece.",positive
This headset works fine. It fits perfectly over the ear. Volume isgreat! connects quickly. No echooo. Maybe all the nay sayers need abetter cell phone. I've tried three bluetooth devices and the HS820 isfar superior to the rest.,positive
"I bought this headset for probably the same reason most people did, the price. For 30 bucks and from a reliable company you can't go wrong. I got what I paid for. The sound quality and the mic quality are both decent, enough at least for someone who isn't obsessive about how crystal clear the reception is. It has a tendency to drop the connection sometimes for no apparent reason, annoying at times, but not very common.About a month after use, it stopped working for no explicit reason. I sent it back and got a replacement from Motorola. However only a month or so after that, I seemed to have misplaced it, and had pretty much thought it was lost.Today, about a month and a half later, I found it, in my dryer. Apparently it had been in the pocket of one of my jeans that I hadn't washed for a while and it went through a whole wash and dry cycle. Happy that I found it, but I all but gave up on it to work again. I gave it a shot anyway, and lo and behold, it did start charging. So after an hour I tried pairing it with my phone, and voila, IT STILL WORKS! I was stunned. Not only that a bluetooth headset could go through that abuse and still function like new, but a headset that seems relatively cheap and outdated!So based on my first experience it was a 2, but any piece of electronic equipment that can survive a wash and dry HAS to get two more stars in my book. Reliable, and saved me from shelling out more money for a more expensive replacement. It gets the job done.",positive
"and i'm fairly disappointed! i bought this little gem at a cingular kiosk in the mall for $80 and i am thinking it's going back before my 30 days are up! in summary, considering bluetooth still has some improvements to make, this is just NOT worth $80, period. even if this device worked flawlessly, it might be worth about $30 at best.here are my gripes:* it says it has a range of about 30 feet. hmmm...not really. i am even using this headset with a motorola phone (V505)and i can get about 20 feet away from it at best before the audio quality goes south. not the biggest deal in the world. even when i am close to the phone however, there can be some interferance (""crackling"") and distortion. usually mild though. it seems like my microwave interferes with it (when it's cooking)!* doesn't fit snugly on my ear. rather, it kind of ""hangs"" there. it doesn't have any kind of mechanism for adjustment, so here's hoping it fits your ear. using this headset while lying down is hard to do; the device doesn't seem to want to stay put.* drops the bluetooth connection every now and again, even when i am at close range.the ""good"":* looks cool! ;)* battery life seems to be pretty good.* small, lightweighti am going to look into some other options. this simply was a waste of money.",positive
"I always thought it was obnoxious to leave your headset on all the time, but now i know why people do it. One you forget you have it on and two it's kind of a pain in the neck to setup. This particular product is pretty good, it pairs up well with my RAZR after saying yes to no less than three questions and works very well. The only complaint I have is it could be louder, but it serves my purpose.",positive
"The audio is very soft of this headset.  I have to use one hand to push it against my ear each time I want to use it.  Also, it is always checking to make sure it is still connected to the phone, so it beeps every 5 to 10 seconds.",positive
"I love this headset.  It's light, has good voice quality, louder earpiece volume than the phone itself (Mot V710) and the battery outlasts the phone.  A previous reviewer mentioned having to carry 2 chargers.  Motorola makes a Y adapter so you can charge both your phone and headset from 1 charger.  I think I paid under $10 for it but don't quote me.  I love the headset but when I'm in an airport, it picks up the background noise as loudly as my voice.  If it was noise canceling it would have gotten 5 stars.  One last note: My phone doesn't ring when connected to the headset so you must have the headset on to know you have an incoming call.  This is a complaint about the phone though not the headset.Update 03-05-2005I just bought an HS-810 because I keep getting complaints of background noise being louder than my voice.  I like it better but the 820 does have better incoming sound quality.  But all in all, I like the 810 much better.  The flip open design is especially nice.  Search for the HS810 to see my complete review.Update 07-21-2005My Motorola V710 went in the dunk a few months ago so I had to buy a new one.  The new software allows the phone to ring even when the headset is connected.  Much better.",positive
I got this as a Christmas present for my brother and he absoultely loves it. When talking to him it sounds very clear and there is no static. It is a much better than my Jabra headset which cost nearly twice the price.,positive
I bought this from Amazon. I linked quickly and worked as advertised.  I found the various button modes difficult to keep track of and found it a real problem over time.My biggest complaint is that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume.  Obviously Motorola did not test their design in a car that had some road noise.  I found it only adequate in a quiet room.  I suspect it is the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal.  I am wondering if an in ear type will be better in the long run.Save you money on this one if you plan to use it in a car.  It is fine if your sitting in quiet room.,positive
"This thing just doesn't work well with the Treo 6501. it doesn't automatically connect, when a call comes, or when a call is initiated2. the volume is way too lowthe comfort is good, but for the price, there are many BETTER headsets out there ----consider the Cardo Scala, the Jabra JX10, and the Palm Treo headset - those are your best betshappy shopping!",positive
"Lasted 3 months, lucky I have two(charge one, while using the other), the units last only for about 2-3 hours of use, hardly good for all day jobs.Like the fit though, but These items need to last the day.",positive

It's an extremely annoying distraction that you don't want to have while driving.On the good side, I don't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use.",positive
"At first, I was a bit leary about buying one of these, because I had heard that they were never loud enough unless you were in a very quiet place. NOT TRUE! I have to say I've had to turn down the volume on this before! Now, don't take that out of context, but this is a great product. I live in Texas and drive a loud truck, and I've been able to use this product driving down the road! I would definitely recommend this product. A great purchase for the money.",positive
"This headset seems to work fine, but the audio quality is nothing to write home about, to the person on the other end of the line you will sound soft and like you are talking on a speakerphone. They will also hear a lot of background noise. I am much happier with the Cardo Scala 500 Bluetooth headset. It has much better audio quality and even comes with more stuff for about the same price.And, you may not really *need* a wireless bluetooth headset because you can just use a wired one or use your speakerphone. But I admit that it's sort of cool to be totally wireless-you can put the phone in your pocket or purse and be totally unencumbered by wires, which feels a bit safer and freer, especially while driving or when you have to work with both hands and talk at the same time for example.A note about the battery-do not store this unit (or your phone) in a hot car! Heat damages batteries and shortens their lifespan.",positive
"Problems I've got with this unit:1. Too short range; much shorter than stated 10m;2. Lost signal or lost connection with cellphone more frequently than I imagined;3. When I used this headset to call my friends and T-mobile customer reps, they usually complained that they can barely heard my voice. Maybe the voice collected by the headset is too weak!",positive
This is a great cable for me !!I love using it in my car.I connect it to my smartphone to listen to my radio app while I am traveling out of town.Once I lose  range of my favorite  radio station I plug it in and  continue listening  to my favorite radio station thru the app. .Great deal !,positive
"I bought this to connect walkman type gadgets to my car stereo.  It worked well at first, but the wiring quickly started having problems.  The sound would cut out and I'd need to mess with the cable to find a position where the wires inside would be touching correctly again.  After 8 months, the wire is now completely detached from one of the plug ends.  Maybe the heat of my car played a role in the breakdown of the cable, but if that's how you're planning on use it, don't be surprised if it starts shorting out on you too.",positive
"It does what it's supposed to.  Hook up my cell phone to my car so I can listen to my mp3.  I'm not a audio geek/master so I don't know if it's a good decibel or crisp bass or tremble, but songs seems to play well.",positive
"We bought this item to replace a broken 3.5 mm cable we use to connect our FM modulator to our iPhone 4s.  We needed something with a thin piece of rubber over the plug so that it didn't catch on the after-market case on our iPhones.  this product worked great, and the price was excellent.",positive
The price was good and the cable works great. It seems to be well made. There isn't much else to say about this product.,positive
This is a basic cable.  It works and it is cheap.  There is not much else you can say about it.,positive
"The concept of the phone is terrific.  I have to use a 2-way pager for work, and instead of carting around a cell phone and bulky pager, I now just have this one small item.  And while I didn't think I'd really use it, the Bluetooth functionality has definitely sold me.  I can use it not only for a wireless headset, but to connect to the internet and to transfer sound files back and forth as well.The software of the phone seems to be a bit buggy still, unfortunately.  When I lock the keypad, I still sometimes hear tones when the keypad is pressed and the display lights up.  The menus are sometimes slow to respond, delaying as much as 2 full seconds (doesn't sound like much, but it can be irritating).Overall, I'd buy the phone again without hesitation, but I'm an early adopter.  If you're willing to put up with the occassional buggy behavior, I'd definitely recommend this phone.",positive
"If you have large hands ( like me ) you will find the keyboard difficult to use. I had particular difficulty with the 5-way directional button. No matter how carefully I used the button I ended up hitting the adjacent buttons too. I also had problems using the camera feature because of it's tiny size. However, in the interest of full disclosure, I am a bit of a klutz. I was also displeased to find that the unit's limited memory made any real web browsing impossible. Also, there appears to be no Bluetooth compatibility with Macs. It will sync with the use of a data cable ( a separate purchase required ), but I think it's a shame to spend the extra bucks for Bluetooth only to find it is of limited use.What made me decide to return the phone was that I found the signal to be weaker than any other cell I have ever owned. We live in a little valley that compromises the signal of any cell phone, but the A630 couldn't establish a solid connection.It's a great looking device and it feels very well built. The screen is small, though it provides a very sharp image. I strongly expect that a more nimble fingered PC user might find the phone's many features to be tons of fun.",positive
"The A630 is another ground-breaking handset design from Motorola.  It showcases the ingenuity of American engineering when you see the QWERTY keyboard hidden underneath on this lightweight (4 oz.) cell phone.  It's stylish, too, and has great reception -- that is, where T-Mobile has coverage at all.  Compared to the Sidekick II and many other T-Mobile phones, the A630 has the best signal-keeping capability, but T-Mobile just sucks big time, unless you live right next to one of their sporadic cell towers.  Worse, their GPRS (data) network is slow and congested.  While surfing the web on the A630 is really cool when the network is accessible, for most part of the day the network is slow and often inaccessible.  We really need the govt to step in and mandate that these cell companies upgrade their networks first before charging consumers an arm and a leg for data services.",positive
"Wife loved it as the ""Razr"" thin phone craze took over. Flip phone with keypad was nice. Used it 2 years with 0 problems.",positive
"This phone is good for the price, but if you really want a good mobile email solution, get a Sidekick II.Positive:The A630 has good sound quality, and absolutely fantastic sound quality if you use a bluetooth headset. T-Zones service is an inexpensive way to gain access to your POP3 email accounts. It has a keyboard. You can download pictures to and from your computer using a bluetooth connection (I did this using my Mac).Negative:The built-in email software is very poorly designed. It is sloooo[...] It requires way too many key clicks to accomplish common tasks. The most common email commands are buried in the menus, the least common commands occupy the prime spots. Someone didn't think about this enough. It takes me 7 clicks to delete a message -- that's too much. They don't take advantage of the keyboard enough: The keyboard has a Delete key, but you can't use it to delete a message. That's a waste. Likewise, you have to scroll through your emails one...line...at...a...time. Why not use the space bar as a quick scroller, like in Outlook? To issue a command, you have to use the menu and arrow keys. They should have assigned letter or number keys to each menu command so you can navigate more quickly with single keypresses. (My old Sony-Ericsson phone had this feature)The case is pretty, but because it's perfectly symmetrical, you can't tell which end is up by feel alone. The keyboard is so slick that you can't dial by feel either -- you need to look. These are safety issues. (but if you have a headset, you can dial by voice)So far, the battery doesn't last more than a day with below-average use.The A630 is best for people who want bluetooth, and who primarily talk or text, and who use POP3 occasionally, or not at all.",positive
Pros:1. Compact in Size;2. eye-ball-absorber design;3. Good bluetooth connection (w/ HS820 headset);4. Convinient input keyboard;5. The screen is clear enough to show a vivid picture;Cons:1. battery is toooooo weak. A full charged battery can only last for one day (with normal amount of incoming and outgoing calls and without any other devices connected). A lot shorter than they claimed in the description (6 days in waiting mode)!2. A little bulky compared tp other camera phones(like samsung);3. The phonebook is a little different from all the other brands;4. System freezed up once when I input phone numbers with bluetooth device connected. I have to reset it by taking the battery out;5. No zoom function with the build-in camera; Can't observe the picture from front small screen when taking photos with the phone closed;6. No software; Just one Java game come with the unit. No choiceother than purchasing more on line.,positive
great product at a great price,positive
"I have placed these in several of my phones since they first came out in the 1990s. I know that they made a big difference in my older phones that had physical antennae&#8217;s which needed to be pulled out of the phone.  Since the phone antennae&#8217;s have changed, I haven&#8217;t been able to notice any significant improvements with these installed or without them. I install them now because I got some for free and this is probably what they are now worth. The level of improved reception is about as noticeable as the loss of cash that I paid to get these free signal boosters.",positive
"This item does nothing to enhance the signal in your phone, I followed the instructions and applied the antenna as stated but no change in the signal strength. I guess that's the reason why they're selling so cheap. Do not waste your time with this product.",positive
"Forgot I had this on my phone until I got the request to review it. But, my phone has been working exceptionally well lately...because of these boosters!! I have a Blackberry Torch. You just put this sticky little piece of film by your battery and *viola* you have way better reception!! Seems to do the trick. Recommend!! And it's a great price to boost your phone's antenna.",positive
So far it's working as intended. I'm satisfied and the price is right. Easy instruction of how to install the booster inside your cell phone.,positive
It gives more bars then had before. Such a perfect item. Made my bf very happy as well. So perfect of an item.,positive
these things are ajoke they do nothing for the phone but for the price it was a fun thing to try. but really not worth a dime,positive
"We've had the Sidekick II for about two months.  Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to ""press 1 for English"", etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.  Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter ""A"" has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.Oh, yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.  You can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper, it isn't really ready for prime time.",positive
"First, let me just say to those who bash this phove because of T-Mobile, STOP!  You are here to review the phone, not the service.  How is it phone's fault?  It's your service and shouldn't be phone's fault.Pros/Features:Qwerty Keyboard makes it easy to send text messagesWeb BrowserAOL Instant MessangerYahoo MessengerEmail at your fingertipsCamera Phone with Room for up to 36 photosOrganizer/Calender/CalculatorNifty Design reminds you of a mini-laptopCons:Bulky:  Looks like a mini-laptop but won't fir easily in your pocket...Case/Belt Clip is a MUSTButton Size:  Could be small for those with big fingersWeb Browser:  Slow, but beacause the sites could be cached, it gets a tad faster.  Don't expect cable speed!  This is more of 28.8 speed.No background wallpaper: Because of the deaktop icons, background image isn't availableOverall...Positive Outweigh the tiny Negatives by a ton.  If you are an internet.IM junkie, you will fall in love with this phone.  The reception in my area is fine.  However, the reception varies from area to area.",positive
"I really enjoy this device--being able to check email and blogs and send IMs while out and about is really nice. However, it's kinda huge compared to a regular cellphone, and I found that to be a bit of a drag. My service agreement seemed kind of pricey,  and the coverage was poor (I couldn't get a signal in my own kitchen, and I live in the middle of a big city, not out in the country) and in the end, I've shelved this phone for a smaller one with a cheaper monthly fee.",positive
"I started out with the sidekick color switched for a short time to the Blackberry 7100t and then came back to the sidekick II. I So love this phone. There is no other phone on the market that compares in many areas.Pro's -Super easy to use.Best messaging out therebest screen out therecrazy good data servicegood downloads for ringtones, games and appsGreat signal (I was in rural Kentucky and still got a signal)Very reliableBest Data/Voice plan with T-mobile -- I have been with T-mobile for 5 years or so and have tried other services during that time. No other service has provided any better phone, signal, or features for a lower or even a competitive price.Con'sIn order for service to remain good you have to periodically reset the phone. Dont know why, but when I do that it fixes any reception problems. T-Mobile techs said this was a good idea.That's it everything else is normal and great about this phone.Unless you need corporate email dont bother with the blackberry. It was the worst phone I have ever used.",positive
"I've had my SKII fo a little over a month now and find it a good fit for my needs.  I am a business user, not a Snoop Dog groupie, and this is a VERY cool device.Coverage in my area (Austin, TX is good)and while I have not yet traveled away from the IH-35 corridor, I had good voice and data coverage all the way to the TX/OK stateline (as far north as I went). For $20/month all you can eat data, this is a screaming deal.  I don't find the web surfing that useful (speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago.  The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident, but if that's a concern, limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth, no resident memory for email, pictures etc, no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature, easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email. The web and other stuff are ""OK"" but TMO data network will have to get faster and more WAP coded websites for content that is relevent for that to be a big reason to buy/use this device.I purchased through Danger's website total cost $0 after $200 instant discount and $100 in rebates. Worth a year's contract with TMO in my book.  Paying $49/mo for 3000 regional anytime minuets and $20/mo for all you can eat data (email, text messaging, etc, etc EVERYTHING DATA included).I would recommend this to anyone that really needs email and occaisional web service in addition to phone service.  Not the smallest/best coolest phone, but the best convergent communication device on the market right now IMHO.",positive
Pro's:Very easy to use.Qwerty keyboardOTA (Over The Air) software upgrades that add usability to it once or twice a year.Full buddy list loading for AIM and YIM.Synchs to both Windows and Mac computers.Large clear screen.Allow for export of web bookmarks.Use up to three Pop3 or Imap4 email addresses with it.Con'sNo external memory.limited camera memory.no Bluetooth.no spell checker for the emailNo Microsoft Exchange email support so no corporate email unless it is a Pop3 or allows you to login from the web.Overall an excellent device.,positive
"I give it five stars - despite some technical problems:You can send and receive vcfs in e-mail attachments - but you can't always file them when you receive them. They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory, and otherwise are formatted correctly, they will get taken. But, some applications, for example, evolution, that great Linux e-mail application, does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename, so the sidekick will not file evolution's vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard's formatting, the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface, so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs, but you can't click on them. You can't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself, then click on the URLs out of the mail, where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say, ""With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser?"" - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.That is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site, and, in openoffice, I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express, and then imported.  Oh, yes, I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file, just like Outlook had, and, poof, in about a minute, a couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using, but that didn't work.I've resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes, I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.I did drop $10 for the terminal program, and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode, by port. I can ssh, securely, to my server. There are lots of disconnects, mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes, but a program available in Linux called ""screen"" allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them, see their output, get status, and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal, it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways, emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode, but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only, sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client, which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client, which drops and reconnects all the time, is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and, unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text, or, if there is none, ""[IMAGE]"", the button completely goes away, which means that you can't access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally, web sites are mis-represented - on eBay, for example, there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don't work.Despite all these niggling problems, and t-mobile's hapless tech support, I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand, but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh, browse at all, much less pull up mapquest maps.",positive
"The Sidekick 2 has a better form factor than the competitors such as Treo 600/610 and Blackberry offerings. It has a better more comfortable keyboard. It's more like a mini computer than a phone, which I like. It can fully multitask, unlike Palm. You can download a webpage, check email and chat on AIM all at the same time, unlike  on the Palm, which will interrupt the process if you leave the application. Further, the Sidekick II has both AIM and Yahoo! Messenger.I like the built in camera and I find I don't miss having a Palm at all especially now that you can use Intellisync with the Sidekick 2 to sync all your contact/calendar information with your desktop computer. I never really liked stylus input on the Palm anyway and again the keyboard on the Sidekick is a lot better. The Blackberry units are nice however I still find the Sidekick more cool, easier to use and it has better instant messaging capabilities.My only slight complaint is that the Sidekick 2 does not have a replaceble battery. I would much prefer to be able to swap out the battery.",positive
"I have used a lot of screen protectors for my iphone, and this one is the best. I'm happy to finally have a clear screen cover that works. For the past two years I wouldn't even try them, using only the anti-glare covers. Then I would get tired of the anti-glare covers because in my opinion they detracted from the attractiveness of the screen.This cover looks great; you have to look real close to even realize there is a cover on there (wasn't the case with previous clear covers I had used). Boxwave sent me cleaning supplies with the two covers - that made it very easy to apply without getting any dust caught in between. And finally, finger prints do not show up as readily as they do when there is no cover.Nice screen cover. Highly recommended.",positive
The order was delivered on time and the clear touch is nice fit for my Galaxy S4. I ordered the anti glare version and it is easy to apply w/o any air bubbles. The protector works nice on the sun light. Also no finger prints or marks visible. Would definitely recommencement.,positive
"Absolutely love this screen protector. It came on time and the product was just as expected. I love how it comes equipped with everything you need to install it. A wetnap, dry nap, cleaning cloth, and the flattening clip you use to even out the protector once its on. It looked very professional and my Galaxy S4 Screen looks SUPER vibrant and clean. You can not even tell that theres a screen protector. I would recommend this screen protector to anyone because the value surpasses the price. Afforable and efficient.",positive
"I've been a loyal BoxWave customer for years. The quality, price, value, and dust free installation are unbeatable. These shields do a great job at protecting ALL of my electronics and also hold up well to scratches so that I don't need to even replace them. Could not be happier.",positive
Just recived my screen protectors and there amazing. They came packaged very well. They come with a very thivk cleaning cloth and some wet and dry cleaning wipes. Once I put on protector on it was really clear no problems at all great feeling to the protector it was cut really well. Will defenetly buy more when I need them wont be using another protector but boxwave.. very satisfied (:,positive
"Oh my, crystal clear... stands up to its name. ..absolutely easy directions to follow... No lint. . my screen looks like it has no protector on it. I am very careful with my device, so I do not know how it will handle items scratching the screen or fingerprints..I received it quickly, and I didn't have to pay for shipping, plus because I bought one item, received this packet for free. It comes with two screen protectors. If you follow the directions, you should not need the other. I have purchased others, and followed the directions and still end up with lint underneath... YES, I would recommend this item. ..It is a must have for your phone. ..",positive
"I'm a lover of all gadgets and always have to get the ""coolest"" cell phone out there at the time.  This phone has been really great over the past 14+ months that I've owned it (I have the blue version).  I've not had ONE problem with it doing anything it shouldn't do (i.e. randomly powering off, antenna problems, etc).  I cannot say that for every cell phone I've ever owned.  LG makes a great cell phone and within their different models, I think this one is the best I've seen so far.  My brother has this exact model and loves it, too.The phone has a beautiful color screen, easy to navigate menus, a nice camera and video function, and OUTSTANDING battery life.  The only complaint I will echo is that it would be nice at times to have a speakerphone.  Other than that, this cell phone is the best I've found - including several other LG models that friends and family own.",positive
I had it over 3 years and it was working great. Battery lasts very long. Phone is very durable and solid.,positive
"I regret buying this phone, it's really big, and verizon service isn't that great with this phone.  For some reason other verizon phones have like 3 bars when mine has 1, or will have 1 bar when i'm getting no service.  That said, the phone does have a beautiful inner LCD, the outer LCD is pretty bad.  You can play with the settings. It has loads of features like alarms and calanders and everything else you could think of.  The camera is terrible, which is pretty much true with all cell phones though, so that's a non unique gripe. The phone is also moderately fruity, like when you make or recieve calls, the outer LED will start blinking purple, blue, pink etc and it makes you look like a teenage girl, and the menus are all kind of childish.  That said, when the phone does have some bars, calls never drop and it's pretty easy to set up the phone.  I'm not sure what other options there are out there for verizon cell phones, i recently switched from tmobile, but im sure you can do better than this phone, good luck.",positive
"i like camera phones, but i can't believe this phone don't have usb cable to upload pics..i have to pay $.25 for sending each pics..Viewing all camera phones, this one is pretty nice..It's got flash, and it's got 4 different types of resolutions..It zooms in more than i expected..Other than camera, for contact list, it gives you to save #s, pic, ringtones for a person..I think thats good..i guess that's all i'm gonna say..Overall, phone is decent.For other viewers, if you wanna buy this, you should buy it now, and don't wait cause more updated phones will come out soon",positive
"Ok, so I used to have a Motorola T720 (one of the worst phones made), and a Motorola Timeport 8767 (One of the best phones ever made).  I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store.  I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think...this thing is huge!  I don't need a camera in my phone...but then I pick it up and play around with it.  It's pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen is nice, bright and clear.  I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives, I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much...the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen.  Included are some wallpapers, 3 ""real"" pics(A Sunset scene, an island scene, and a group of people scene), a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few ""doodle type"" cartoony pics.  You can change the settings for the display easily, as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto.  The front LCD is nice enough...you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones...kinda forgettable (I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones).  You can however, record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic, as well as download them from Verizon's Get It Now Brew service.  You can also, use MP3's as ringtones through a little trick.  One think I like...this phone is loud!!  I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even.  The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly (though this requires you to flip open the phone).The camera is located where the ""hinge"" of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens.  You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones, etc.  The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera.  There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics.  The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends.  While I figured I'd never use this feature, I have twice already.  The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice...it's fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone, they won't probably guess you're video recording them. :DThe call quality is nice,loud, and clear...much better than my old cell phone. Battery life for me has been approx. 5 days with light usage and charges in a little over 2 hrs.  Mind you, the old ""blue versions"" of this phone had a charging plug near the data port...the new ""black face"" ones charge straight through the data port.The holster that came with mine (the black vx7000) was great...solid and not cheapy like some phones are.  Notice that the face of the phone flashes colored led's near the ""flash"" when you receieve a call or are making one...some like it some don't.I like the phone and it's size is deceptive. Tonight I showed it to a friend and she said, ""that thing is huge!""..then we compared it to her Panasonic camera phone and she noticed...hers was bigger lol.  This is one of Verizon's best cell phones right now...highly recommended.",positive
"Guys,I have used several of my friends bluetooth headsets (motorolas and jabras) and had decided I didn't want one.  Then I found the Mobile Freedom and read the reviews.  I know Logitech and have used a lot of their stuff with good results so I tried it.  IT DOES EVERYTHING YOU HAVE READ!!  It's quiet in the wind, it's battery lasts for days for me, it's easy to use, easy to pair and the sound quality is awesome!!  Nobody could ever tell I was using a headset.  It takes a bit to get used to the ear clip, but once you do there are no problems.  It may be a bit heavier and larger than some, but then those little tiny ones that look so chic also have TERRIBLE reviews and TERRIBLE performance!!  Try it out, you won't regret it.",positive
"I get significant transmission static with this headset with my I-mate Sp3i unless I point the phone directly at the headset from a few feed away. It has static if I put the phone in my shirt pocket! Since I haven't done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets, I can't say if it is the headset or the phone, but either way, if you buy one of these and have the same problem, make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder (the part that holds the headset to your ear). This is a bad design and honestly, there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear. The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out, which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so. Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note: The wind blocking technology works well, but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent. I've asked a few of my techno-geek-friends when I'm talking to them with the headset, and they all say that the sound quality seems to be missing a full dynamic range.Good luck!",positive
"I bought the Logitech after reading numerous reviews on various brands.  I use the device with a Motorola V551 phone (Cingular).  It works geat!  It charges very quickly and the charger folds up in a compact fashion when not in use (the electrical prongs fold up into a recess in the charger). The unit holds a charge for a long time.  I left it in a drawer for a month, pulled it out and it was still ready to go!I use the device a couple of times a month on business, when driving, etc.  The windscreen is outstanding and cuts out noise even when driving with the window open.  some people complain about the ear piece.  It seems fine to me and you can adjust it easily, but keep in mind any headset is an annoyance when you first wear one.  Then it becomes second nature.the sound is great, the phone detects the device quickly, its fairly comfortable. All it all it performs just like a device twice its price,",positive
"Its the only bluetooth headset I've used, so I don't have anything to compare it with.  Has made my ipaq 6315 much more usable as a phone.  Sound quality is good, some people say I sound far away, I'm experimenting with the gain on the ipaq, we'll see if that helps.  It was a little tight for me at first (big ears), I was able to bend the part that goes around the ear a little and its much better now.  Great battery life.Would be nice to have an external ringer on it, so I could hear it ringing or vibrate if I were away from the phone.  Good range 15-30'.",positive
"i had bought the motorola HS820 before this one for $80. i have a motorola V505 from at&t.; the motorola worked pretty well, but i thought $80 for a bluetooth headset was way too much. i returned the motorola and picked up the logitech instead and for 1/2 the cost, i was just as happy.it fits a little awkwardly on my ear, but so did the motorola, so i am thinking my ears are the problem. call clarity and voice recognition is good. battery life is good. weight on ear is good. overall, i am pretty impressed!i wish there was some way to adjust the tightness of the earpiece as it feels kind of loose on my ear. would also be nice if the ""on"" button wasn't so small that you covered it up with your finger when you turned it on, making it hard to see the flashing blue light.whenever i use my microwave, it makes the bluetooth connection drop. just warning ya'. ;)",positive
"I've been using this headset for a few months and couldn't be more pleased with the battery life. It recently had no problems keeping up with a four hour Skype session!It is also capable of pairing with multiple devices, so you can for instance use it with your computer at home and your cell phone on the road without having to redo the pairing every time, something cheap brand-X headsets don't do.Logitech was kind enough to supply a very tiny charger, perfect if you take your headset on the road. For those international trips, no problem: it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz (translation for the technologically challenged: you can use it anywhere in the world, just get a cheap prong adapter)On the negative side, it's possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you're not careful. Of course the battery won't charge up and the light won't go on, a dead giveaway. It caused no damage to my headset, but the connector design could be better.I found this headset very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The volume is loud and the sound quality is very clear. People on the other side liked the sound quality as well.There are a few negative points that cost this otherwise excellent headset a star:* after 10 minutes of inactivity, it goes to low-power mode ""sleep"". When the phone it is paired with rings, it may take up to 5 rings for it to wake up and start ringing. If you press the answer button before the headset starts ringing, you will lose the call. If you want to answer right away, you can always answer on the phone but if you do so pressing the answer button on the headset will not transfer the call to the headset like it did on my Sony Ericsson HBH headset, but hang up. To transfer the call to the headset, use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating, non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks, don't forget that this is a very capable, well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price, one of the best out there. If you can live with the looks, it's a super deal.",positive
"the ""behind the ear"" thing just broke...I baby my stuff and treat it VERY lightly, and this piece of junk just fell apart!!!Very dissapointed!!!I should have made my additions to this review long ago, but Logitech cam through for me on this headset in a huge way! They immediately sent me a replacement of the headset, but not just a replacement, an $85 replacement! Then told me to keep the broken one, which I was able to fix with some Krazy Glue!Really incredible customer support...I will never hesitate to buy something branded with the Logitech name!BTW, 5 stars on the earpiece itself once it was repaired with the glue.",positive
"I'm a great believer in spending as little as possible on glitz,bells and whistles, and generally go for performance and practicality. Sound quality and features are fine for the price.  But the unit is quite difficult to wear -- the boom is wide and boxy; the weight is unbalanced, as well.  I could not get a comfortable fit.  My ear is well within normal range of size and shape, but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive, wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here.  If you don't care about medium to long term fit and comfort, or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear, you may be happy with this headset.  I wasn't, and am returning it.  I'm going to give the Cardo Scala a try;  if it's no good, I'll probably go with a Jabra, and spend a bit more money.",positive
"I've had this for about a year.  It works great.  Great call quality, no static.  Battery life is real good.  The only bad part is this looks like a part of a males anatomy and I don't really want that on my head.  Otherwise great buy.",positive
"Let me say a few things:Buy THIS device.  Here are the reasons:- 7-8 Hours talk time- True 30 feet range- Wind filter for clear talking- Small and comfortable, doesn't intrude your ear- Crazy price, huge quality- Warranty and reliability of Logitech!I've used a Sony Ericsson and Jabra BT200 and I would say the Jabra is much better than Sony Ericsson, but the Logitech blows them both away.  It's faster to put on the Logitech and the range is much better.  The microphone is clear and crisp and the speaker volume is loud and sufficient.For me, I used a Jabra A210 bluetooth adapter for a Sprint Sanyo 8100 phone w/2.5mm headset jack.  It gave me BT on my phone so I could use this headset.  The auto-answer and hang up depends on your phone whether it would normally do so with a headset or not.  Works great for me!If you are considering a headset, get this one.  It's what bluetooth technology should be like.  It's so great that Amazon sold out...  nice.  It was $39.99 (where did they all go???)",positive
"I was a bit skeptical when I saw the price and read some reviews but I thought hey its Logitech it must be good.  I was right this headset is very comfortable compared to another headset I just bought.  The ear speaker is loud even to the point that I don't have to have it on the highest setting.  The mic was the thing I was worried about though, so I called my friend's cell phone and talked to myself and I was pleasantly surprised with the sound volume and clarity.  Also I haven't had any complaints from other friends I've talked to with the headset.  It has been my experience that Logitech makes the best wireless devices for the buck and they didn't let me down with this one (second Logitech wireless devices in two month; I also bought their xbox controller which is definitely also worth the buy.)",positive
"The sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech.",positive
"I have used it now for 2 weeks with a RAZR V3 and I am satisfied it works as advertised. It was very easy to pair the headset with the phone. The sound is good even in noisy environments. The headset is light, confortable and fits well.My only complaint is about the smart button used to turn on/off, answer, dial and pair. The button is also a LED indicator. The LED flashes diferently (different colors, intervals) for various modes but it is difficult to see the LED while pushing and holding the button. After a few days I got used to it and now I know how long to hold the button down to switch on/off, pair or use voice dial.At $42 it is a good deal.",positive
"very cheap excellent value. the problem with most is their uselessness when confronted by windy conditions- this does a much better job than most. v simple instructinos, though it lacks the ability to switch easily between headset & phone & back.nevertheless at $35 or under, brilliant value.",positive
"I bought the Logitech Mobile Freedom Headset (980228-0403) for use with VoIP on my HP zt3000 Windows XP SP2 notebook. I wanted to use a wireless headset and VoIP to make international calls, mostly from hotel rooms. This headset did not work out of the box for my situation. The Logitech support website was great. It said to upgrade the notebook's bluetooth software. The HP site was also excellent. I downloaded bluetooth and many other newer drivers. Once installed, the headset immediately worked as docuemented. The other newer drivers solved all the weird hibernation problems I've been experiencing too. I'm using Skype for VoIP service. Skype setup has an option for using the bluetooth headset for Skype only, otherwise the normal audio devices are used. All in all, installation was a bit of upgrade work but competently supported. I now have a VoIP connected wireless headset that allows me mobile freedom. Due to my usage, I have no comment on the audio quality or useability with mobile phones. The device apparently will not work with the majority of PocketPCs due to a lack of bluetooth software. Thus I only gave it 4 stars. However, HP does sell stereo headphones (no microphone) for most IPaq models.Update: 15-March-2005 Am able to pair with Axim x50v PocketPc. Has considerable static. Skype and other apps nearly unusable. Continues to work with XP well. Suggest Plantronics MX100I Stereo Headset for using Skype on a PPC.",positive
"Got this headset to replace my Jabra (which was incompatable with my Nokia 3650). Fit and comfort is extremely subjective but I found the Jabra to be far more comfortable (I would actually forget I was wearing it); that said, this unit is not uncomfortable (until after a couple hours) just not nearly AS comfortable or securely fitting.Very few complaints as far as performance. It was easy to pair with my phone, my wife's Motorola V3 and even my laptop. Sound quality is clear for both parties (recipients occasionally complained of a pinging noise with the Jabra) and the noise reduction actually works to eliminate wind noise. Battery life is excellent. The single function can be a little aggrevating (especially when trying to turn it off as you have to hold it down for a long time). The only weird and very rare quirk is occassionally calls will be interrupted with a strange sound that sounds like someone dropping a manhole cover as it spins on pavement - very strange, very annoying and fortunately very rare.Overall, performance is top notch, comfort is acceptable and value is difficult to beat.",positive
"I have been using this for a month.PROS:It is a good value.  It works really well, and it lasts a very long time on a charge.  The WindStop feature works very well.  People have been able to hear me very well while driving and even while playing volleyball.  It stays on the ear well but is not uncomfortable.CONS:The unit looks okay but is less attractive than some of the other high-tech units on the market.  3 of my co-workers have commented that it looks like I am wearing a phallic symbol on my ear, which is really not the look I would like to achieve.",positive
"Because I spent a lot of time on the phone, I am very particular about BT headsets.  I have tried every brand of BT headset you can imagine, I mean EVERY brand.  I was so frustrated to a point I was ready to go back to wired headset until I ran into this little guy.  This is by far the best one, hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don't understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby, in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity, which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset, you end up with wind noise, car noise, AC noise, every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional, the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to ""get off your crappy Jabra BT headset"" or ""take me off your Motorola BT headset"".  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem, the sound quality is amazing, by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone, this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit, but it's really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is a ""correct"" way to wear this, and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can't speak for all, but I personally don't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety, so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note, this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.  I am sure customers that raved about Jabra would rank this unit out of this world!",positive
Good reception. It fits OK on my ear but not perfectly. It seems sturdy. Price was better than most. The wind doesn't bother it much either.,positive
"We bought the Plantronics HL10 Handset Lifter to go with ourPlantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headsetand have been very pleased with both devices. Using the handset lifter give you the ability to answer calls directly from the wireless headset, which is good if you spend a lot of time away from the physical phone to which the headset unit is connected.Setup was amazingly easy, just following the directions allowed us to get this installed in just a few minutes on our very inexpensive no-name speaker phone.Like our Plantronics Headset, this has passed the test of time and I would buy a new one if it failed today.Highly Recommended!CFH",positive
"This device allows me to answer incoming calls on my NEC phone while I roam the office with my Plantronics wireless headset in place. This headset already has enough wireless range to cover half the floor in my building, so the ability to answer the phone at such a distance is extremely useful in a bunch of situations. A couple of key features:When a call comes in, either Intercom or from an external line, there is a chime in my ear that alerts me to the call. I can then press the single button on the headset and the receiver is lifted, allowing me to receive the call.When the call is done, I press the single button again and the receiver hangs up.It's about as simple as conceivably possible.The install instructions were however less than perfect. To get this to work properly, I have to unplug the phone base from the handset and in to the Plantronics unit. The handset is then plugged in to the Plantronics unit. This was not explicitly stated in the install instructions. It took 10-15 minutes to figure out the trick. Once that was worked out however, everything has been perfect.The only thing that I cannot easily do is pick up parked calls as there is no function to select a line. I can live with that shortcoming.",positive
"First of all, I must start out by saying that I am a little surprised that this little mechanical device is even necessary with all of the technological advances out there these days.  The HL-10 is kind of a ""throw back to the seventies"" in terms of its jerry rigging function.  Having said this...  Plantronics builds quality stuff and I am sure that there is a good reason for it.  The device does exactly what it is supposed to do once you adjust it for your individual phone.  I was a little concern that it would fit my phone but they include plenty of adjustment options to take care of any setup.  I am using it with a Plantronics CS351N  headset - which I love for it professional wireless function.  I tested the HL-10 by picking up/hanging up the headset 10 times in sucession and the lifter raised and lowered the receiver successfully each time.  That was good enough for me.  Definitely worth the $ if you own a wireless headset and you roam around the house/office while talking on the phone.",positive
"There isn't much to say here.  For the phone system I have, this was needed to enable the remote functions of the  Plantronics-CS540 Convertible Wireless Headset.  It could be more aesthetically-pleasing, but as I'm sure it's designed for a wide variety of phones that need a remote lifter, I suppose you can't complain.Mounting the unit can be tricky.  You need to be certain it will work properly before you use the sticky tape to mount it in place.  So, you wind up holding it with one hand while working your headset to activate/deactivate it several times to be sure you've found the right spot for it.Comes with a special headset adapter for phones with shapes that offset the lifter bar.",positive
"This device takes a signal from a wireless headset like the CS540 and lifts up the receiver from your base phone unit. Depending on your phone's angle and the conformation of the receiver, it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent. But the next one lasted 2 minutes (an M22) which only lasted that long because I tap danced on it before I threw it in the trash. The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn't arrive DOA. That's right, dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped, only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice! Overnight emergency turns into a tech job for me, plus a week's wait. I put all this stuff in the review, because I'm not sure Plantronics deserves their top spot in telephone headset and accessories. We're pretty much stuck using them and I see the quality going down over the years. This lifter is case in point; it's not the swiftest design imaginable. The little extender rod/gripper that is your last-ditch method to get your receiver to hang up is a kludge, in my opinion. Perhaps you've had better results, but I find this thing less than perfect.",positive
"It looks strange stuck to the side of the phone, but we have an older Starpluss STS system that needs the handset lifted for a wireless headset to work properly.  This item was easy to set up.  It took about 10 minutes to unpack and install.",positive
Our office phones lifters stopped working so I decided to take a chance on these lifters instead of having to order a whole new headset and so glad I did.  They work great!,positive
This handset lifter is great.  It works exactly as I expected it to. It also arrived when I expected it to.,positive
"The vender of our phone system wanted to charge us hundreds of dollars for some other mechenism to interface with our wireless headset system.  The Plantronics HL 10 was not only much less expensive, it works flawlessly and was easy to install.",positive
"HL10 Handset lifter works great, very fast to pick up if away from the phone base!  I would buy again.",positive
"Works Great, a very useful accessory for any wireless headset and the Amazon price is right compared to what Plantronics wants!!!",positive

"I had to teach an on-line WebEx class. Normally I am provided a phone bridge. However, this time, they wanted to utilize VOIP only. I didn't want to use a normal head set with a cord tie'n me to within 6 feet of the computer. I needed 8 hours of talk time, I'm the instructor. This fit the bill. I let it charge over night and it's ready for the next day. I do put it back in the charger during lunch break. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is that my ear hurt at the end of the day. The piece that goes over the head to keep the unit to my ear put to much pressure on my ear. I will have to try the other ear adapters.",positive
"This is a usb wireless headset. just plug it in to your mac or pc and it sees it as another sound device , no drivers needed (xp or os x) I tested it with Skype on the mac and teamspeak on my pc . It comes with a sound api for windows for skype and a few others that allow the buttons on the phone to pickup or hangup calls , I did not try it out because I just like to use apps as is without special add ons ...The range is great , so if you skype and dont want to be tied to your pc then plug this bad boy in and your free to walk all over the house , same goes for teamspeak for the gamers out there.It was so pleasing for something to just work out of the box for a change! I tried for hours to do the same thing using bluetooth and it was a mess... This thing just works!",positive
"Set it up, it worked great for a little over 24 hours and the base unit failed to connect to my laptop. Returned and purchased a different item. Didn't want to take the business risk of replacing with the same thing.  Can't afford to be offline for as long as it will take to get this replaced.To be fair, I have used several Plantronics headsets and they were all great... my all time favorite is now 10+ years old and not compatible with Google Voice (though it does work great with Cisco IP phone). I also have a bluetooth Plantronics Voyager headset for my iPhone and it is also very good.",positive
"I use this product for skype calls.  I found it to be the most high quality (but expensive) wireless headset for VOIP uses. I use it on Windows Vista and Windows 7.  The headset lasts a long time (all day) without charging, and I can go from my computer outside the house and half way down the street and I still have clear calls.  The ear piece is not as comfortable as I'd like, but after you wear it a while I think your head adjusts to the shape.Software install was easy, and setup was pretty no-brainer.  It has other functionality and adjustments that I do not use and have not had to learn about.I use this brand also for a regular phone headset on my work phone and absolutely love it.  I've found very high quality calls and battery life on every Plantronics device I've ever used.",positive
"My previous two PalmOS phones were a Kyocera 6035 and a Samsung i500. Had I not needed Bluetooth to work with my new Toyota Prius, I'd have stuck with the i500. In fact, if Samsung/Sprint had released the i550 (SD memory slot, faster, etc.) I would have never considered the Treo 650.  So, let's talk about the positives of the 650:Camera w/movies is nice.  Memory card slot is nice.  It's fast. Bluetooth sync with my Mac Powerbook is awesome - no more plugging up cables to HotSync! Handfree in the Prius works great. Having a PalmOS 5 based machine gives a more powerful web browser that can view more sites. Higher rez screen is nice.On the downside, the lack of graffiti would be okay if this keyboard was as good as the one in the old Motorola PageWriter, but instead, it's as small as they could make it, requiring shift-keys to get to slashes, @ symbols, numbers, etc. A real hassel and even though I could blaze on the PageWriter, I've been reduced to about half the speed on this keyboard due to all the extra work.  Having software-graffiti would have been nice, and the third-party add-on ""write on screen"" apps are okay, but not as accurate as what my 6035 or i500 had.No voice recognition at all, but for $20 you can get a program that is awesome and doesn't have to be trained.  ""Call 5 5 5 1 2 1 2"" and it does.  ""Call Bob Tompson Mobile"" and it matches it to the address book -- no training, beyond numbers. VERY NICE.Battery life is so-so.  You have to charge it each day if you use the 'net much. i500 was poor, too, but better than this.  The 6035 I could use for almost a week without charging it!  (6035 and i500 had analog modes, too, while the 650 is digital only.)So, it's okay, I'm okay with it, it crashes/reboots randomly all the time, but ... there's really no other option on Sprint.I would have taken a flip phone over this huge brick phone in a heartbeat... But there is none, so, with that said, the Treo 650 is okay.  More steps back, a few steps forward, but no other choiuce.",positive
"I just got the Treo 650 through pre-order the other day after using the Treo 600 for over a year (and 4 replacements ... the 600s just kept breaking). It is a dramatic improvement and I love it.The screen is now high res and looks incredibly clear, the Bluetooth works wonderfully with the wireless Jabra headset. When a call comes in simply hit answer on the phone and the call comes through the headset. I don't particularly like the comfort fit of the Jabra on my ear so I will probably be looking at other alternatives as well.The camera is now actually good enough to take snapshots you would keep. Almost as good as some of the low end digital cameras.  A few of the critical buttons are placed more intuitively.Initial setup went pretty smoothly, so far, it seamlessly upgraded my old Treo 600 software and imported all my contacts and calendar as well as almost all my applications.  The Sprint phone rep that activated my phone actually seemed to be quite knowledgable.The only real CON is that the Treo 650 Hotsync cable connector is big and clunky compared to 600. IMHO they made a backward step by replacing the sleek original Treo connector with the Tungsten design connector. It requires a separate power supply to charge.  I have been used to charging my Treo 600 through the single USB hotsync cable to my laptop.  This extra power connection is a messy annoyance.  The upside is that since the battery is removable I can have a spare charging elsewhere.Overall opinion is that I wouldn't even consider returning to or buying a Treo 600 now that the Treo 650 is available.",positive
"I am not too picky when it comes to a PDA phone, if I can keep my outlook calendar, appointment, and call the contact store on it, I'm happy! But I do wish the Treo 600 can be better!I had the Treo 600 for almost 1 year and upgraded to Treo 650 as soon as PalmOne asked me to that's because Parts of my prayer has been answered: A better screen resolution; touch screen is more sensitive than the 600, I use my finger instead of the stylus now; camera is a lot clearer and the zoom works great; removable battery is really handy to use that fully charged spare one any time; my favorite bluetooth is built-in. And that little keyboard lites up in bright blue and white is very easy to read. Thanks to the faster processor, the program loads a lot faster.However, I am still looking for the built-in WiFi, and the bluetooth does not take voice command; reboot is not as easy as Treo 600. I do not notice the boot up being slow because I rarely have to. However, I did notice that it takes up more internal memory and thus make the available ram less than 10MB the first time I turned it on. (Palm is doing a flash upgrade to fix this, so I heard.) With an SD card, I put a bunch of application on it to get around this until it get fixed. And I was able to have about 18MB available internally.I like this new Treo 650, as to all my handheld gadgets, I bought a fitted case to protect it. If you like me want to keep everything in perfectly nice looking condition, I recommad a case and a screen protector. Remember, this is a hefty investment comparable to a PC, this Treo 650 may even be your home phone, make sure it is well-protected.",positive
"I have had this phone almost 6 weeks (40 days).  At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working (a, s, d, f, and g, etc).  I was told to call Palm in India, which I did, and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up, because I have really loved Palm.  This is my fourth Palm device, though it will likely be my last.  I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation.  My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, my Palm T3 and my laptop).  And then, that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course, when I took the phone to Sprint, they said it was Palm's responsibility to repair.  When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes, as they always do.  Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink, that they said they would give me - this one time - a ""free return and repair,"" meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days. They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $25 to get a refurbished replacement, complete with a 90-day warranty (which I now know means nothing).  These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just don't work, and that I needed something immediately.  I don't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people, or how I can be made to feel like they're doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn't that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon's remains very, very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone, or any device, it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working, the company that sold it should stand behind their product, instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence, other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s, as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box, the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle, which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often, the phone just resets itself - can't figure this one out at all.  Also, when someone calls in on Call-Waiting, you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words, when you accept the Call-Waiting call, it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously, even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also, there are limited, non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don't get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise, all the Palm applications work as they should, and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all, I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm, and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant, but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?  I know mine tries to; otherwise, we're out of business.",positive
"I purchased this phone a few months ago and can truly say it is one of the best investments I have ever made! I had doubts on how comfortable I'd be lugging around a big phone like this, but that was short lived once it was in my hands. I get so much use from this phone, not only for the phone itself, but for the PDA capabilites. I have never been so organized and on top of things. The only thing is that it sometimes freezes when it connects with my Bluetooth, but it's a minor complaint and one easily overlooked when I look back and see how much this phone has helped me.",positive
"I've owned a Palm of some type for about seven years, and had a cell phone for slightly less time.  I've always resisted buying a combined device, because I thought ""they aren't ready yet.""  When it came time to replace my PDA, I decided that the Treo 650 might be ready.  I had concerns about the size of the screen, and about integrating PDA and cell phone functions.  Overall, most of my nervousness about it was groundless.  I am pleased with the phone so far.Good points:Works well as a phone--Better signal than the Nokia phone it replacesScreen is very readable, even though it is smaller than on a traditional PDAPalm functionality is fine.  The interface has been redesigned a bit, and you seldom need the stylus.  Most entries are done with the rocker switch at bottom center of the screen, or with the keypad.  You truly can do many functions one-handed.  But they managed to do this without losing the feel of the Palm, you aren't having to re-learn from zero.The memory is non-volatile--In English, this means that if your batteries go dead, you don't lose all your data till you re-synch your Palm.Bad points:Those who complain about a slight delay when dialing from a number in the Palm contacts list are right.  It's not really a problem, but it is an annoying couple of second delay.If you are one of those who read books on Palms, I'm not sure the screen will do for prolonged reading.Battery life is fair.  I am able to get two days out of it with medium use, and have a bit of life left in the battery.  Not like the days of the monochrome Palms when you'd go for a week between recharges!It's only so-so as a web browser.The price is hideously high.Keyboard is cramped, but about as good as you can expect on such a small device.  It is definitely useable.  My instinct was to use my right thumb only, but I now believe the people who claim that if you use both hands (thumbs only) you'll be faster.From what I've seen of the Treo 600, I do not believe the upgrade would be worth it for those who currently own a 600.  If you are waiting to make the jump into a combined PDA/phone, I believe thhis is a good point to do it.",positive
"I am in love with this phone!First off, the Palm functionality is wonderful! The address book and calendar all work excellently, and the cross-functions are greatImprovements include SMS messaging, which is much faster and now includes hyperlinks for phone numbers and web addresses, unlike the Treo 600The web on here is faster ---- the screen is crisperHowever, BlueTooth is the BEST new feature ----- wireless data transfer is, usually, quick, and the wireless headphones are greatLastly - many have complained that the phone is too slow with its functions and unstable --- however, ever since the system software was updated to 1.12, it has made the phone much quicker and much more stable!Ordering a new phone today should come with that 1.12 software built into it, alreadyI am a former Treo 300 and 600 user, and the 650 is a wonderful upgrade and worth every penny, considering the bluetooth and software improvementsso buy it!!! - you won't be sorryPS - the Cardo Scala bluetooth earpiece is the best earpiece out there for this phone",positive
"I purchased the Scala 500 as my first BT headset and I regret it. The company is v-e-r-y slow to respond to email messages to their support box, so call them, don't write.While the sound quality of the unit is very, very good, there are other issues with the unit. First, the fit on my particular ear is horrible... always feeling like it was going to fall off. I never trusted it walking through airports as it just didn't feel secure.Second, the unit literally fell apart in my hands after three or four months. The portion that protrudes gently into my ear came loose, then broke off. I note that others have metioned the same thing. It just wasn't well constructed. Bummer! I've replaced it now with another low-cost unit made by Plantronics, but while I miss the sound quality of the Cardo, I am disappointed by their slow support and poor quality.",positive
"Solid bluetooth headset, particularly considering the price. I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside. It's extremely lightweightSolid bluetooth headset, particularly considering the price. I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside. It's extremely lightweight and can be worn for hours on end without discomfort. I've only had this for a few days, but so far the battery life seems great as well.",positive
"I had this headset originally, and then lost it.  After I lost my original, I figured I'd give a motorolla one a try, and purchased the most expensive motorolla on the market (H700).Using my treo 650, I COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING people were saying, and got constant complaints that the people I was talking to couldn't hear me well.  The volume was terrible, and so was the sound quality.This headset is SO LOUD that i have to keep it on the 3rd from highest setting.  The clarity is great!  People think I'm talking on a land line.  For the $35 bucks, I bought a new one and chucked my motorolla in the garbage.IM SO HAPPY TO HAVE MY SCALA BACK!",positive
"Let me say up front that I ordered this from Amazon after reading all the glowing reviews, and I've been fairly disappointed by the performance I've experienced.  My experience was specific to using the Scala with Sprint's LG-PM325.First, the audio quality was not good.  If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset, I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception.  Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio.  When using the headset with my phone, while the phone was in my front pocket, the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable.  And it's not by hearing.Second, there's the shiny blue light.  When I read other's comments about the flashing blue LED, I really didn't think much of it.  But in the dark, this thing is a strobe light.  At night, with my headset left on some countertop downstairs, and while I was upstairs, I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling.  That's part A.  Part B, the flash results in a very slight audible clicking, not unlike when a camera flash goes off.  Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence, be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you're wearing the Scala.Battery life was good.  Pairing was excellent.  The piece stayed on my head pretty well and comfortably, and making or answering calls was straightforward.I've returned mine because of the two problems.",positive
"Probably the biggest compliment you can give this headset is that you'll often forget you're using it.  The Scala 500 is incredibly lightweight and (when adjusted properly to your ear) very comfortable.I'm impressed by the controls.  Both the main button and the volume 'wheel' are very accessible and very responsive.  With the Sony HBH35 headset I was constantly dropping calls due to the unresponsive controls.  This never happens with the Scala 500.  Additionally, volume is easily regulated.Pairing with the Motorola MPX220 phone was quick and easy.  Additionally, reconnect is quick and reliable following a disconnect due to powering off one of the units or going out of range.  (Range, by the way, is good; comparable with the HBH35 headset.)You can hear the other party clearly and crisply.  Transmission of your voice, I would say, is good.  Though there's infrequent interferrence (static) on voice transmission, I've never had anyone complain about difficulty in hearing/understanding me.  There's NO annoying ""bluetooth echo.""To sum it up:Plusses:  Price, size, weight, comfort, pairing, controls, sound quality, range, responsive customer service.Negatives:  Requires charging cradle (one more thing to haul around if you're traveling), no 'fuel guage' to indicate battery life (red flash comes on, but only when it's close to dying)",positive
"Works well even in the wind.  Can't listen to music through it with my SLVR though, as expected.  I find I don't use it much though.I set up a shortcut in my SLVR for quickly enabling bluetooth when I am wearing my headset. If I have a bluetooth headset active, it refuses to play music at all - through the built-in speaker or a cable.  But this is the fault of the SLVR.Update:  I dropped it outside, where it got rained on for two days before I found it.  Thoroughly dried it out and turned it on.  Still works!",positive
"This is my first bluetooth device. Read reviews and considered other headsets costing $50 and $100. Based on reviews and value, got this one. Have used it three days.It works well and came with a good set of accessories. My only complaint really is that the tone of voices on my end sounds a bit like a tin can phone. Intelligibility is not a problem, but the sound is a bit disconcerting. Most people I talk to say it sounds fine on the other end, but one complained of the ""tunnel sound.""But it is a good value. It synched with my T-Mobile Wing right away. I think it dropped a couple of calls, but cannot be certain where the blame lies. I just walked away from the phone and when I came back it reconnected immediately.Other comments: The eyeglasses clip is a great idea but I'll have to modify it to work with my thin wire frames. The ear clip is fine. The supplied neck cord is a good idea, but I'm not using it. The belt clip seems a bit vulnerable as it sticks out pretty far.Mine was missing the full manual (a return?), but the online PDF was easy to find.Overall, I did expect slightly better performance, but am satisfied with the value and general function of this headset.",positive
"I was so lucky to find this headsetI use a Treo 650 ----- I have tried a variety of headsets, including all of the Moto's --- the Scala is clearly the BEST for the Treo 650, and likely, many others1. The volume was very good --- louder than any other headset I used with the Treo 6502. The connection times are usually very fast too ----- most headsets take awhile to establish a connection, but this one usually takes just a second or less, and of course, automatically picks up both outbound and inbound calls3. 90% of the people I talk to say that they can hear me very loudly and clearly --- rarely do I get a 'barrel' effect going with this headset, as many others produce4. The wind-noise-cancelling technology is for real --- I have talked a couple times outside, in blizzards with this thing on --- quality was loud and clear on both ends, despite the high winds!However, it seems that I have to re-connect the pairing for this device, every now and then (maybe once every 3 weeks or so) ---- otherwise, I'm very happyPretty good talk time and battery, and of course, the volume is great!Check it out in new colors ---- clear, blue, and red!Lastly - the price cannot be beat!highly recommended! - HAPPY TALKING!!!!!",positive
"Let me begin this review by stating that a lot of people have used this device quite successfully.  As for me, there were two main problems.  First, I found the sound level to be too low.  While it's easy enough to turn up the volume, the problem lies in the microphone being so close that it causes a major echo for the person on the other end.  The second problem I had was that I was never able to transfer a call from the device to the phone.  I tried to use this model for a couple weeks just to make sure but, after that time, I decided to send it back and keep looking.",positive
"Compared to Motorola Bluetooth headsets, this Cardo really rocks. It has much better mic and speaker sound quality and volume than Motorola. The Motorola makes me sound like I'm talking on a speakerphone while the Cardo is a bit better in this regard.That said, because the mic is so far away from your mouth, you will still sound very distant and a bit muffled. With this Cardo, callers still complain when I'm in the car or outside on a windy day that there is a lot of background wind noise.I ended up going back to the wired headset that came with my Motorola RAZR phone, which has much better audio quality and is not as cumbersome to setup during a call as a Bluetooth headset.",positive
"I am using this device with a Polycom landline phone.Trying the 3 settings I can get a decent connection on my end with a separate Bluetooth earpiece, where I hear the other party fine with little noise and no echo.But on the far end, even landline to landline, there is an annoying whine and some echo, no matter what the setting.  This isn't good enough, I prefer to use the corded headset.I am returning this product to Amazon.",positive
"I use a nextel i730 and this jabra adapter fits on the back perfectly with velcro. (adapter is approx 1/8 thin)  The adapter has 3 tiny setting to adapt to different phones and I find setting #2 to work fine with my motorola HS820 wireless earpiece. This adapter works on Nextels direct connect and regular phone calls, my last adapter would not do the direct connect. So far I have had the adapter and earpiece on for over 16hrs with out a charge, while receiving many phone calls and direct calls during these hours. Can't wait till Nextel comes out with a bluetooth phone but till then, this is the only way to go!",positive
"I bought this item @ a local retailer, was happy cause i got it on sale (probobly clearance) well it worked 2 days then the wire going into the unit it self would get static if touched!  I can not find my receipt, so i e-mailed jabra & they are acting like this isn't an issue! wanting to know how many phones i tried, if i tried more than 1 headset, etc.... i will prolly get no where or if they do accept a return the S&H Charges will be stupid & not worth replacement!  Just get a nice wired headset, less $ spent & less headache!",positive
"Ok. I just bought this adapter today for my PDA cellphone.  The product integrates well with everything (My Laptop - sony vaio, cellphone (siemens sx56, my panasonic cordless home phone (although with the panasonic, ppl complain about my voice being faint)).  But the issue is , I hear static crackling noises even if I'm not in a call. As soon as my bluetooth headset is connected to the a210 adapter, it produces faint-medium crackling noise. The noise is exactly like the one it produces when you move out of range.  But happens even at 1-2 feet distance.  I was initially confused on what is producing this.  The battery was fully charged on the adapter.  The bluetooth headset is not the issue, as it connects well with my laptop (which has integrated bluetooth).  Then I figured, if I keep the adapter and phone closer (few inches away from my ear) to my headset, then everything works well. Otherwise even at a distance of 2-3 feet , it starts the crackling.  I even switched modes (1,2,3) on the adapter and still the same issue.  Although it works upto 20-25 feet, the crackling starts at a distance of 2 feet.  I even turned off my wireless networks to test this.  Also exchanged it for a new one, to see if it was a item specific issue.  But even the 2nd one is having the same problem.  The manual says, that it is due to interference.  I think many 2.4 Ghz can cause this inteference.  Alhtough I turned off all of my wireles devices, it still caused the issue even in my car (slightly better, but not totally gone).But in any case if you don't hear the crackling, it integrates very well with everything.  The crackling is heard only by you, not by the person on the other side.  So we can probably live with it.  There are not many bluetooth adapters that are available out there.Note: Many reviewers here complain about this adpater not working well with home phones.  First of all, if you read the manual, this is not designed to work with home phones (if it works well with home phones, then you're lucky).  It is designed to work primarily for mobile phones only.",positive
"Perfect for my Contour Roam GPS camera.  I got two of these to have as powered spares, along with a portable charger (that also charges via USB), so I can always keep one charging, one charged, and one being used!",positive
I bought this from Amazon to have an alternate batters from my GPS logger and it gets the job done. Its cheap and worth the price...,positive
"I bought this battery to replace the one in my dash cam. i charged it up like the instructions said to do, and wow. i can use my dash cam a long time before plugging it in to the power point in my truck.the price of this battery is really good for the service that you will receive from it.if you need a new battery get one of these.",positive
"After searching and searching for a battery for our baby monitor -- the Levana BABYVIEW20, I found out that it uses this Nokia battery. I was too nervous to buy this type of product for any seller other than Amazon. I did just that and it works and fits perfectly.",positive
I could NOT get it charge. Did not sent it back because it would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it. I ask for help on this and got no where. But I did order Nokia BL-5C and it works great.,positive
"After 6 months of use, the battery still performance well.  I can't tell if this battery is genuine or not.",positive
"No issues at all with this battery order.  Its an OEM Nokia BL-5C battery as advertised.  Nothing exciting and performance is as it should be for a new battery.  Price was excellent as compared to retail, so I am very satisfied with purchase.",positive
"I purchased this for my father-in-law. His battery was about to wear out its welcome. It arrived ahead of scheduled date, and has not had a problem with it.",positive
"I recently purchased two of these batteries for my four-year-old Nokia cell phones.  Based on about a month's trial, both batteries seem to hold a charge for a reasonable amount of time... much better than the old batteries.  Seem to be a good choice, especially for the money.",positive
"The nice thing about this battery in my case, is that it came fully charged and ready to use.  It fit perfectly in the phone as I would have expected.  It's an excellent buy compared to other sources.",positive
"I purchased this battery for a premium as it boldly proclaimed &#34;Li-Ion&#34;.  That purchase was before I noted that all of the other, more inexpensive batteries were also Li-Ion types, and also OEM.  My fault for not paying attention.  Be advised there are better prices for this exact item on Amazon, so please keep looking.This having been said, the item was shipped quickly, and arrived so fast that I almost had to duck.  I therefore have no issues with the seller, who is doing a good job.",positive
Works.  Good quality battery.  What more can I say about a battery?  It fits.  It charges.  It powers.  It's a battery at a very reasonable price.,positive
I bought this is a gift for my brother. He loves it! It works perfectly with his iPhone 5 and even works with Siri.,positive
"Loving it. Clearly sound on calls, long live battery and comfort ear hock. I trust all of Motorola Bluetooth Headset.",positive
"Overall, an OK headset that, versus the H700, trades better inbound voice quality for less outbound quality. Given its low price, though, it's a great value, though I can see why some RAZR and PEBL boxes include this for *free*. My report card:Design: A-, nice simple design. Buttons are few and easy to use, though the main button is a bit sensitive. Single-tap to power-on  is a welcome feature. USB charging a real plus.Aesthetics: A-, it's attractive in its minimalist aesthetic. Color options are cool. (And there more of then if you shop elsewhere!)Build quality: A, it's a solid unit with good materials.Comfort: B+, it's lightweight with a decent ear clip. Unfortunately, the earclip is loose on the headset which, combined with the light weight, make for a very ""floppy"" fit.Compatibility: A, no problems pairing. Connects quickly when turned on. Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use.Outbound sound quality: B, callers can hear me fairly well, but many have complained of a pronounced ""speakerphone"" effect requiring some self-repeating. OK noise cancellation.Inbound sound quality: B+, volume is more than adequate, but could be a tad bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but could use some bass. Minimal static.PS: A previous reviewer believed that, like the HS850 with its folding mic boom (the on/off and connection switch), you need only turn on the H500 when receiving a call; the headset would connect quickly with the phone and pick up the call. THIS IS FALSE. You must leave the H500 turned on and actively connected to your phone in order to use it, just like any other headset.",positive
"I bought this Bluetooth as a back-up for my pretty pink Motorola H500. Therefore, I placed it in the drawer until I needed a replacement, and last night i needed it. I plugged it up for a couple of hours and tried to pair it to my new phone and it did not work. I then charged it overnight and again tried to pair it and nothing (not one indicator light). I plugged the blue-tooth back into to the charger, it had a steady blue light and i tried pairing it to my phone while it was on the charger and it worked; unfortunately, i can not walk around with a charger and outlet attached to my head. Consequently, this was a lemon and due to the months passed from my internet purchase, i am unable to return it or exchange.Therefore, the moral of the story is to test everything you purchase from the internet. I learned a valuable lesson.",positive
"This probably isn't being sold any more, but I really enjoyed my time with it.  It lasted me three years!  Compared to the new ones out, this is bulky and sound quality isn't as good.  But the fact that it remained in tact in working condition, especially with a rechargeable battery is remarkable.",positive
"This bluetooth is basically ok but the part holding on to your ear is very 'flimsey' and tends to want to fall off if u bend over so u have to keep securing it on your ear, which is quite annoying as I almost lost it a few times not realizing it was no longer on my ear...so it's a huge drawback for me. It seems to work ok otherwise tho sometimes I do have a  sound problem that is not present when I just listen straight from the phone without it...it's sometimes quite garbled. So this product for me though cute, is average in fuction.",positive
"I have paired this with an unlocked RAZR, and so far they both have worked great (2 months).It fits well on both ears, not so big, and the voice quality is very good. I also found the price from amazon, really competitive",positive
I STILL USE IT TILL THIS DAY. IT HAS NEVER LET ME DOWN. I LOVE IT. HEADPHONES CAN'T EVEN TOUCH THIS!,positive
"While this doesn't have the range of the Nokia bluetooth headset i tried, it is vastly more comfortable.  I've used it with a Samsung t809 and had no issues with it over a couple days before this review. Range was about the 30 feet they are supposed to have, beyond that signal fading was rapid. Very light, easy to use and fortunately mid range signal tones.",positive
The Motorola H500 is a very good unit.  It has excellent sound quality and is easy to operate.  The only negative thing is it does hurt the ear after wearing it for awhile.,positive
"Bought two of these yesterday.  Pink one for the lady and grey for me.Voice quality, both incoming and outgoing is excellent.  So light, you can wear it for hours w.o. a problem - you forget it is there.  Volume is definitely loud - but can be adjusted, if you want.We are using it w. SE r520m phones - first generation (""years"" ago) that had BT built-in.I had bought a Cardo ""Allways"" head set in 12/03.  It was so cumbersome, neither of us really used it. It was uncomfortable.I can see I'll be using this most of the day.  I am a heavy cel phone user - 2000 min./mo. - mostly day time.I find it strange in reading reviews of these items that some find a model to be quite good in a feature (eg. volume) and others find the same model unacceptable.  Since no two people have the same size OR shape ears, probably a headset should be tried on for fit before purchase - just like you would a pair of shoes....mt",positive
"The price of bluetooth devices has gone down dramatically that I was able to justify buying one:)  The H500 works fine with our LG Shine.  Although you may need to talk a little louder so that the other person can clearly understand you (Well, not too bad really).It was an easy setup.  The device itself looks fine, not too dorky in my opinion. It also has a nice blue LED light. Available in many colors of choice.Why not 3 stars?  The volume control is hardly palpable.  It is hard to adjust the volume while in use.  Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust.  Even the call button is difficult to press.I like the ear hook can be flipped to be used either on your left or right ear.  It is also not too heavy to be worn comfortable on your ear.",positive
I bought an H500 a few years ago when it first came out. It was plagued with low volume and poor connection. After using a nokia bluetooth for the last year I got this one again because of the no cell phone laws in California as of July 1st.This headset is plenty loud with my Sony Ericsson T650i and I haven't had it drop the bluetooth connection yet. The volume sits a little below half and I can hear perfectly in the car. Battery life rocks and voice clarity is a lot better than I remembered it with the first H500.4 out of 5 stars because the ear clip is flimsy and doesn't allow the H500 to sit tightly against your ear. So if you're planning on using this while running or during an intense walk - don't count on it.Definitely recommend this as a great bluetooth device. Can't go wrong with the price!,positive
"I bought two of these. One fits over my ear perfectly while the second unit takes a little more time to secure because the ear hook is kind of loose. They're both plenty loud enough, clear reception, good range (phone can be two rooms away), and people on the other side of the call say they couldn't tell I was on a headset.Great performance considering the price paid.",positive
"This Bluetooth sucks. Plain and simple... I mean I paid, what, $15 for the thing so wasn't expecting the best but at least working quality. I always buy the Motorola H730 or H750 which are upwards of $60 but I always lose them. Always! It is a curse so I figured I would get a rinky-dink cheap one so I wouldn't cry in the corner losing out on a day&#8217;s worth of work pissed and distraught over losing my (what is this my 6th) Bluetooth. But with every call - EVERY ONE - it was unbearable static on my end so much so that everyone mentioned it. Hell, even the recorded lady on the voicemail was like this thing sucks! So yeah just spend the extra cash and go up a few grades because this was a lost cause.",positive
"Very pleased with this purchase, excellent sound quality when speaking and listening. Also, the plug for the charger is sturdy and a good fit for the headset.",positive
"I needed a BT headset for the longest time.....since I never used one and was getting worried that I may get busted one day.  I saw this on Gold Box and ordered it immediately for $15....how could you go wrong?It is intended for use primarily with a Blackberry Javelin (8900).  It paired quickly has held a charge for 2.5 days thus far (light-moderate usage).  My opinion is that it does what it should at its price point and I was not expecting a miracle.If you are looking for a BT set that has loads of noise canceling and voice detection..then this is not for you.  Look for a Jawbone by Aliph...The H500 is a model that has been around a long time and is perfect for my needs.  I just wish it were a bit louder and thus I am giving it a 4/5.Great value, great item.",positive
"This is my first bluetooth headset so I don't have anything to compare it to, but so far it seems to be pretty good. It's small, very lightweight, and comfortable. It's hard to judge the comfort of this device unless you try it yourself because everyone's ear and head are different.I'm using it with a Motorola Razr V3m from Verizon. It paired easily and quickly. The connection is a little crackly even right next to the phone, which surprised me, but it's not so bad that it takes away from a conversation. Naturally, the further you get from your phone the reception deteriorates. Volume and clarity are fine and sound just like holding my phone up to my ear.Overall it's a good headset and fine for my purposes. Only a few drawbacks: the volume and call buttons are a little hard to manipulate, and it would be nice if the unit could be held tighter against my head.",positive
"Right off I have to say that when it comes to cell service and phones and the inherent contracts: you get what you pay for, in more ways than one, and buyer beware!  I do my research, ad nauseum, before getting into a new contract or into bed with a new cell provider. I've been a Nextel subscriber for two years with an i90 and an i730. Both lovely phones - service very professional from Nextel - coverage and features what I expected.  But like I said, I researched that to death before I bought their phones or their service.  Got the phones from Amazon.I, too, was taken by the looks of the RAZR, and so was my wife once she saw one.  But was it as good as it looked and was it worth and worth switching carriers for?  For one, Nextel wasn't making it easy to stay with them - they got into bed with Sprint and I had Sprint for years and still have nightmares about their customer service.  (Plus, the price for an ""upgrade phone"" for Nextel was *unacceptable* from my point of view.  Everyone knows you get a cheaper phone with a new contact!)I got two RAZR's at a local retailer - sorry Amazon, but your rebates with Cingular aren't worth the effort - and paid $99 each, best price *anywhere.*  I got a family plan which is on par with Verizon's and saves me a bunch of money over Nextel.  A *bunch* of money.  Two words: rollover minutes.I spent just an hour charging the phone, reading the manual and configuring the phone to function as well, if not better, than my i730, which is a *great* phone, and noticed similarities in function and detail and quality to Sony, Motorola and Nokia phones friends of mine have.  I repeat: I read some of the manual, which is something many people seem to avoid.For anyone complaining about the phone/ address book, shame on you.  I was worried about the address book based on reviews, but after five minutes with the manual and using the phone, I got the RAZR to do *everything* my nifty i730 could do and then some.  There are so many ways to configure the address book it's silly.  You can assign and create ""categories""  for numbers and addresses and even have the phone only display certain categories so you only have to flip thru the numbers you want to flip thru.As for the complaints about battery life, the RAZR has a six-plus hour talk time on it, better than half the phones on the market today.  I can say that cos I feel like I've researched about half the phones on the market ... :)  Do this: plug your phone in when you go to sleep at night.  I can *guarantee* you it will be fully charged in the morning.Fragile phone? How clumsy are you?  I've beaten up lots of phones over the years and you should expect just about anything this side of a brick to break when you drop it.  Half of my i730 is made of the same material the RAZR is and has a lousier belt clip to boot, which has allowed my i730 to fall the the ground way too many times.  I'm happy with the material and it's expected durability.  Stop throwing your delicate, *expensive,* micro-electronic device around like it's made of teflon.  *Be careful.*I am not on the camera-phone bandwagon primarily because what is required to merge unlike technologies is by it's nature usually expensive and difficult.  (A good example is the ROKR, the so-called iTunes phone.  I have an iPod, and if that phone had come close to actually blending the best of the wireless world and the abilities of iTunes and the iPod,I would have bought it, but it came far short of doing that cos blending two ideas like that isn't the easiest thing to pull off well ...) The RAZR is not expensive because it has a great camera or a large memory stick or can capture full-motion video and zip it over to your dorm room buddies in the blink  of an eye.  It's expensive because it's a *slick* looking phone and makes other phones on the shelf self-conscious.  Most of the professional reviews of this phone gave it low marks for camera abilities, so don't be surprised by that.  Want a good camera phone for Cingular? The Sony s710 got great reveiws; good luck getting it for less than twice what the RAZR costs.  That's the difference.Last thing - I got the phone knowing I have 30 days to send the whole thing back if it's not working out for me.  So there's a little consumer-friendly cushion to give me some time to fully evaulate the phone.  Still, I did my research so there wouldn't be too many surprises when I got the phone.Hope this helps.",positive
"The phone is ok. I didn't find any difference between RAZR and the Motorolla V300 I had earlier. All the features are the same.Razr has a big huge color screen, bluetooth enabled and can capture videos. But there is no improvement on any of the calling features.So if you are getting the phone free after the rebates you can buy it, else it is not worth the $200.",positive
"I'll start with the bad first, given the amount of interest this phone has generated.1) The Phonebook application is a little...wonky. Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the ""MORE"" function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the ""audio sweet spot"" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone.3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? ""Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower.""4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says ""Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet"". My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV.5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work.Alright, so now for the good.1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades.2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left.3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree.6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.",positive
"The #1 reason to buy (and keep) this phone is the slim form factor.  Let's face it - for guys who don't like to keep the phone on their belt like a pager, a pants or suit pocket is the only option.  This phone is far and away the best one in that regard.  I forget it's there a lot of the time.  It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily.However, the battery life is terrible.  I literally have to charge it every night after less than two hours of talking with bluetooth.  You MUST get the car charger immediately.  Even though I had bought one on the internet, I couldn't wait for it because the phone kept dying so I raced to a local cingular store for an intermediate car cord.The Motorola HS-850 BT headset is great but occassionally loses connection w/the phone, which is frustrating.The only reason I kept this phone is the size.",positive
"This is one great phone, sleek, light, small, thin. Motorola got the form exactly right, just slightly larger than a credit card, and only a half an inch thick. The screen is excellent.Motorola missed big time on this one, not including Motorola Phone Tools and a USB cable in the purchase - now how cheap is that. I just spent all that money on a super exclusive cool phone, and they make me buy software for $30? That's actually kind of crazy.They also messed up on the phone book. 450 Outlook contacts, that were spawned from 200 core contacts - each cell phone, business, email, and home entry for an individual is a separate entry. Way way too unwieldy. They need to update this error big time. They've also missed on priority numbers - you know, you identify people you call a lot, and they go to the head of the list. I'm used to the problems now, but wow what a miss on their part.The camera, oh it takes pictures. They look decent on the cell phone, but forget much more. The shutter speed must be very slow, you have to hold the phone solid to not get blurry pictures (when viewed on a computer screen full size) - on the phone they look great.Overall - my nits are truely nits, this is one heck of a great phone. If you're price sensitive, buy the V500 series. If you want cool, get this one.By the way, I'm a long time ATT customer and had no trouble (read it took less than 10 minutes to buy and activate this phone) with Cingular. In fact the service seems better. I just wish they would port over your voice mail.",positive
"I bought this becasue I was very happy to see a phone with a metal case again.  I used to just use nokia phones back in the day and they would break at least once a month on me.  Bought the Moto v60 and was really blown away.  The best phone I ever had.  Then I upgraded to color phones and tried the other Motos.  Really big disapointment.  Moto phones are made so cheap and fall apart just like nokia.  When this came out I jumped on it.  Finally Moto was going back to the quality phones.PROS:-Some what sturdy case.  The metal parts seem solid. No marks as of yet (1 month).-The battery life is a little tiny bit higher then your average phone.  I have to charge it at night but it has at least half the life left on it.  I talk for about 3 hours a day.-Camera is ok not the best and by far not the worst.-Slim form factor.  And yes its wider then your normal flip but this is a good size.  Other phones always seemed to skinny for me.CONS:-Not all of it is metal.  The bottom is plastic and it seems to be cheap plastic.  It creaks when you push on it.  I think that is where the antenna is, and if it has a SAR rating of .80 (I think) at the ear then I wonder how much your jaw is getting.  Rather my jaw get cancer then my brain right?-The vol is almost a joke it is so low.  At the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting.  I used to have to turn people down on my cell, now I am struggling to hear them sometimes.-The keypad looks nice but its a pain in the butt.  The donut thing in the middle is already scracthed by my finger nail.  The rest of the keypad is protected it seems and has no marks.-A pain to clean.  The keypad is shiny and gets crap all over it.  When you clean it the rubber lining between the keys grabs part of what ever cloth you are using and gets it looking even worse.-Phone book.  Good god man.  The fact that they used this phone book really shows that either they don't put a lot of effort into the phone or was a total mess up.  Either way it is a true shame.-Good luck with support and warranty from Moto.  Past experiences with them was very poor.  You send your phone to get fixed and a month later you get it back and they didn't even read what the problem was before they ""fix"" it and send it back still broken.The reason they make phones out of cheap plastic in my opinion is because what do you do 6 months after your phone looks like you dropped it down the stairs a few dozen times.  You buy another.  Strong durable plastic is used all the time.  For crying out loud Glad uses it all the time.  I am more then happy to pay 600 dollars on quality and if you have the money do the same.  This phone is not even close to meeting my expectations of what I thought I would get for a 600 dollar ""basic"" cell phone.  I have high standards and for top dollar I want the best.  Moto might be seeing this and is offering good rebates now. 250 or something on Amazon as of now.  Well worth it for that price.To the other reviewer about Verizon.  They use CDMA and this phone is only for GSM.  I doubt they will ever make a CDMA version.  But of course I have no real clue.  Call Motorola.Also sorry for my spelling mistakes and all.  It would take to much time to go back and review what I wrote.  I am not getting paid for this and won't waste my time.  Good luck and I think you will be very happy with this phone over all.",positive
"I have been a Nextel user for years and their Motorola products including i90, i95, i730 and i830.  The v3 is the best Motorola product ever!!! Blows the i830 out the water and makes it look like yesterdays news. Superior and striking good looks and is solidly built - no, it does not look cheap as some previous reviewer stated. I live in GA and Cingular reception is very good. Paired my v3 with Bluetrek G2 bluetooth headset(received rave reviews and is cheap - pick one up on ebay) and I wonder what took me so long to get on board. I did fear Cingular's merger with AT&T; since I had AT&T; years ago and their reception was terrible.I'll never go back to Nextel as they do not appreciate their customers and their Motorola products do not have Bluetooth except Blackberry. Plus who wants to carry around a brick in their pocket? I'm a woman and typically carry v3 in my purse but sometimes for convenience I just want to put it in my jean pocket. And I forget it's there...This v3 has superior browser technology, email and text messaging, good camera and great voice record. Yes, the address book is different but you get used to it. Anyways, I only put important people that I call frequently in address book so it's not a problem for me. I primarily make lots of calls and like to check news and send a few text messages. A+++++++",positive
"Sexy form... CHECK. Innovative construction... CHECK. Exclusive price tag... CHECK. In a sea of flip phones and candy bar phones that all look alike, the RAZR V3 is the Ferrari of mobile phones and stands out as such. If you're looking for a feature rich phone, then the V3 is not for you as a V600 will provide the same features for far less. But if you want a high-quality constructed phone that screams, &#34;look at me, I'm a sexy b*tch,&#34; then the V3 is up your alley.Actually, a better analogy would be: The Acura NSX of mobile phones. Like the NSX, I feel the V3 is a marketing tool for Motorola. It's their way of saying, &#34;We're known for inexpensive phones, but, look, we can build stylish, well-crafted, high-end phones too!&#34;Unless wireless technology improves from GSM, the V3 is a phone that I can definitely keep for more than 2 years. The styling, design, and construction is just that good (I upgraded from a trusty and reliable, yet mediocre Nokia 3360 TDMA phone).There's been quite a debate about the construction of the V3 and the best explanation that I've heard is that the bottom backside (below the battery cover) and the lower front is plastic for the antenna. It certainly makes perfect sense to me (unless the metal frame IS the antenna) as all the other areas are cold to touch (in this weather) while those areas are usually room temperature. Furthermore, it would be misrepresentation on Motorola's part to advertise it as such. Regardless, this phone may seem flimsy, but it's very solid -- there is no comparison w/ my old Nokia 3360 and my girlfriend's V551.Mikey's likeys:1- The mini-USB port. This is great for single-point access for data and charging -- it's simple and should be a mobile phone standard!2- The Bluetooth connectivity. Coming from a wired hands-free setup, my Bluetooth headset (a Jabra BT250) is a godsend. I can leave the V3 charging in my home office and still be connected in the living room. (SIDE NOTE: stay away from from the D-Link Bluetooth USB adapter for PC connectivity and get the Belkin F8T001 adapter -- read my review on the D-Link for details)3- Quad band. Doubtful that I'll ever use this feature/benefit, but those two words will certainly impress all around you.4- The speakerphone. I've been a non-believer of mobile phone speakerphones, but I've got to admit, the V3's speaker phone is the bomb. It's loud and clear (but not loud enough for the car). My girlfriend tells me that I sound better w/ the V3 speakerphone than w/ my old Nokia 3360 and wired headset setup. When I don't have my Bluetooth headset, I'm spoiled w/ the speakerphone.5- The internal display. Going to the V3 from the Nokia 3360 is a leap of spacial proportions and after a couple of weeks, I have found myself to be spoiled w/ large internal display. And not only that, the V3 has an ATI IMAGEON graphics accelerator! All other phones (excluding PDA phones) pale in comparison in this regard.Mikey's no-likeys:1- No memory expansion. I don't see myself using up all 5MB of internal memory, but an SD/MMC card expansion slot would be nice. Maybe Motorola (or somebody else -- maybe myself) will come out w/ a mini-USB adapter for this purpose.2- Poorly written owner's manual. I have found that the owner's manual is more like a reference manual and sometimes leaves you figuring things out on your own. It does not explain how to use many common features that owners (especially ones new to Motorola phones) use. Instead, it lists all the features and expects you to put 1 and 1 together. It's like the &#34;C++ Reference&#34; vs &#34;Learn How to Program in C++ in 21 Days.&#34; Maybe Motorola's technical writers are just to technical?3- Drops and dings. Like any &#34;Ferrari,&#34; I'll probably go into a week-long mourning the first time I drop or ding the phone. I'm hoping there will be [good] cases available to protect my V3 while it juggles around w/ keys in my pocket. (SIDE NOTE: I have heard that Cingular / Lockline is not insuring this phone, but my Cingular sales guy was hesitant sell me the phone unless I bought the insurance)4- No EDGE. My girlfriend's $99 Motorola v551 has EDGE. Shame, shame, shame Motorola. Bad Motorola. Bad, bad, bad. Alas, it's akin to buying a $160k Ferrari 360 Modena and having a cheap $20 factory stereo system (or paying $90k for an Acura NSX and it's only 290hp).5- Internal display colors. I was all hyped up to hear about 260k colors, but Motorola's specs after some detective footwork is 65k colors, but up to 260k colors in MPEG-4 video playback. Very, very, sneaky and mis-leading indeed.Wishlist:1- I wished there was a PocketPC smart phone version of this phone. PocketPC + V3 form factor = perfection.Regarding multiple numbers for one name in the review below -- you can set the phonebook to display only primary numbers by:1- setting the primary number for all the names that have multiple numbers (you don't have to do this if a name only has one number);2- set the address book view to &#34;Primary Contacts&#34; in Phonebook Menu &#62;&#62;&#62; Phonebook Setup &#62;&#62;&#62; View;3- voila, only primary numbers are displayed.The way Motorola has implemented this is not very intuitive as Nokia's implementation (refer to my owner's manual dis-like above), but I have found Motorola's implementation to be a little more robust.UPDATE: It's been nearly three weeks since I've bought this phone and no buyer's remorse.",positive
"I've had this phone for a while now and here's what I think.The User Interface has had a bad rap from some people, and yes, it's not as intuitive as say, Nokia's interface, but it does have some pros.  You can customize every button, including all 4 arrows, and the left and right soft keys.  I have my left soft key programmed to go to ""Shortcuts"" and I have every function I need right there.  And of course, after a while of use, you will get used to the interface.The volume of the phone is decent.  I have no problems hearing other people, and they have no problems hearing me.  Speakerphone works great too.  My boyfriend says that he no longers feels like he's talking to someone in a tunnel when I use speakerphone for our calls.  The only volume problem I can see is that at the highest volume (7), it is still slightly hard to hear your phone ring.  One other thing - this phone has way cool ringtones.The address book issue is this:  If you use your SIM card to store your addresses, then no, you will not be able to have multiple entries for one person.  But if you use your phone's memory to store your numbers, you can have many many numbers stored to each entry.  I have all of my numbers stored on my Powerbook's address book, so I'm not too worried about having them on my SIM card.  And if you have a MAC, iSync works wonders with syncing numbers/calendars to the RAZR....now THAT'S cool!The screen is very large and clear.  I have no problems seeing it in dark or even bright light.  I have had no problems with reception with Cingular so far.  In fact, I have a stronger signal in most places than my previous phone (Nokia 6230)Overall, I am very pleased with the design, functions, and asthetics of this phone.",positive
"Bought this phone(Actually the black v3 but the only real difference is video support and additional memory), for $149 from BB, replacing my v551, basically just for the ""chic factor"". Initally I was very happy and excited with my purchase, but after a couple of weeks the novelty wore off and its shortcomings became apparent. The biggest issue I have is being able to hear through the earpiece. Unless you ear is EXACTLY on a random ""sweet spot' good luck hearing in anyhintg but the quietest environments. I even removed the little ""M"" circle with little or no help. The second shortcoming is the the screen. While it has more colors available than the v551 the resolution does NOT look nearly as good. And if you are viewing blacks and not looking directly at it, you get a wierd grey-black thing going on with one eye. Kind of hard to explain, except for those of you with the phone. Much to my dismay the screen is actually WORSE than the one on the v551. The third is the camera. I rarely use a phone cam, but the times I needed it, the pictures looked, well...horrible. And last but not least, the reception. The reception is not as good as everyone makes it out to be. The v551 actually had better reception. My new LG CE500 actually has MUCH better reception and is generally a much better phone. This phone is a GOOD phone. Nothing more nothing less.",positive
"I origanally purchased this phone thinking it had voice dialing similar to the motorola v710. Unfortunately is uses the old style of voice dial where you have to train your voice for each phonebook entry. The v710 does not require this and utilizes true speech recognition software. Since this was the most important feature to me I am returning the razr and exchanging it for the v710. To bad, the razr is superior in most other categories except the one most importand to me. If it had true nex technology voice recogition I would keep it.",positive
"Bought this phone with Cingular service. I needed the phone in a hurry. I checked my order next day, had this weird message:""Order RevisionOrder placed October 08, 2005 at 10:35 PM PDTOpen order -- your order revision requiredhas not approved you for any phone and service plan packages. Please cancel necessary phone and service plan packages from your order. We cannot proceed with your order without some action on your part. Please be aware that if you do not take action on this item within 5 DAYS, it will be cancelled from your order.Cancel necessary phone and service plan packages""I had no idea what this cryptic message meant, but essentially they were requiring me to cancel the order. I have three cell phones in my family, perfect credit, no earthly reason why I wouldn't be approved for a cell phone account, just the above message with no explanation. Of course, there is no one at Amazon to call for an explanation. I don't know if my form was missing some information, or something was mistyped - no idea at all what happened. I think that if Amazon was going to cancel my order, they need to explain it to me.I have bought from Amazon before, usually good service, but this is just awful.I think that Amazon is in over their heads in the cell phone business.From other comments, it sounds like Amazon is not being fully honest or transparent in their cell phone ads.",positive
"If you look carefully at these so called ""bad reviews"" you will notice most of them either don't know how to use the phone OR may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from EVERY manufacturer, EVERY brand, EVERY type of phone.Now my wife & I have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever, we ordered 2, I got the Black one she got the silver one. Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a ""shared plan"" from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your ""Cell phone Numbers"" right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a ""single 700 rollover mins shared plan"" before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect. Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to ""My Account"" from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular ""in my area"" puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away ""With NO ROAMING charges"" btw our last cell phone service ""Alltel"" would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in ""Speaker Phone"" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call ""Mobile to Mobile"".We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it ""needs"" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the ""address book being slow"" not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you don't, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by ""Name"" or ""Speed dial #"" or ""Voice name"" or even by ""Email"" and with or without a picture of the person.Someone said it took them 5-10 seconds to open address book and dial a number from it, well I just now did it in under 3-4 secs, not to mention if you have it set for ""Voice command"" it takes 1 sec.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for ""list only"" ""no picture"" and by ""primary number only"", simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in ""Categories"" such as ""Business/Personal/General/VIPs""Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have ""primary number only"" listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to ""Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers"" once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about ""ear piece volume too low""  the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the ""volume"" is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, make sure your ear is right at the ""top edge of the phone"", too low and volume will sound low. Someone mentioned to take out the little blue cover, do NOT do that since it has nothing to do with ear piece volume, there are 4 speaker holes along the top edge of phone just make sure center of your ear is even with these holes and volume is just as loud as any phone you have used.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose ""PHONE"" seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under ""sunlight"" is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.UPDATE: 4/08/08My wife and I still have both of these phones, neither of us have had even one single problem with them and its getting close to 3 years of everyday use (these are our only phones, we only have cell phone service no land line).The only slight problem we have had in over 2 1/2 years is when we finally had to change the battery we went with the cheap $5 battery that you can find several places and they were no where even close to as good as the original battery but that is not the fault of the phone.These phones have preformed flawlessly and we use the hell out of them.",positive
I live in an area where Cingular service is really good; I have experienced virtually no dropped calls.  The phone itself is not one that I picked or researched extensively.  My son tossed my old phone into the wash and thanks to the insurance I had previously purchased I got this phone as a replacement.  It is longer and wider than my old Motorola phone but it is also thinner.  I was concerned about the thickness and durability.  This phone is also metal so I feel more confident using it than I did my previous Motorola phone.My old accessories don't fit even though it is the same manufacturer this just seems silly but what can you do?I purchased Motorola Phonetools 3.0 by Avanquest for my previous phone.  I plugged my new phone in and the program automatically updated to 4.0 and it prompted me to add a profile for my current phone.  With this program I can make my own ring tones and manage my address book and sync it with Outlook so I don't have to worry about saving my settings to my sim chip.  I also put my favorite picture of my phone dunker and his brother in my phone's memory and I use it as my wallpaper.My Bluetooth accessories work better with this phone than my previous Motorola.  On that phone the connection between the earpiece and the phone would suddenly stop functioning.  I could not hear anyone through the earpiece or using the phone and to make it function I had to power the phone off and on each time I used my Bluetooth headset - annoying.The Razr and my Jabra work well together.  It works great for voice dialing in my experience and I can answer the cell and drive - though I rarely do this because I am one of those people who actually like to be unreachable sometimes.So I am very happy with this phone but in fairness to other reviewers I did not have specific expectations when I acquired this phone.,positive
"I bought this phone because it was a Editors choice in a leading computer magazine.  I would have preferred the Motorola V3 Razor but that is still far too expensive and I have found that this phone is basically the same as the Razor just not as thin or stylish.Plus points of this phone include:- A beautiful screen. It is large, bright, and has excellent resolution.- very good pictures from the camera.  I can't believe that it is just .3 megapixels... of course you won't be able to blow them up into posters or anything like that but for viewing on a computer or even the occasional 3x5 print the pictures are very good.- excellent sound quality from the speaker so your ringtones and the speakerphone sound great.- very nice construction with a easy to grip rubberized metal trim and back.- the button layout is very nice with a dedicated button for taking pictures and volume buttons on the side.  Also of note is that most of the buttons are user programable.- the phone also has voice dialing and picture caller id (although the pictures are very small and do not appear on the external display)- the bluetooth is very easy to set up and use- it is a true Quad band phone that can be used worldwide (although it has to be unlocked first).- excellent battery life.  I can't believe some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every day... I find myself charging the phone after about 4-5 days with moderate use.  Of course I have the screen saver turned off and I make sure that the bluetooth is disabled when I am not using it so maybe that is why I have great stanby and talk times.  Also the place where I purchased my phone told me to charge it for 24 hours before the first use (to condition the Li battery) so maybe this has helped to increase the battery life.The Negative points about this phone include:- the blue external display looks cool but I think it would be more visible if it were typical backlit black on white LCD (like on the motorola v180)- the instruction manual (like most Motorola manuals) does not do a good job of explaining all the features so you will have to play with the phone a little bit to fully make use of all that this phone can do.- Even though the pictures from the camera are excellent, the video quality is not so good.  Of course this is a cell phone not a video camera so I guess it is about what you would expect.  Also there is no flash on the camera (unlike some other camera phones) so low light pictures are not that great.- there is no USB port on the phone so unless you want to buy a motorola cable, the only way to transfer pictures to your computer (and mp3's to your phone) is via bluetooth. (HINT: you can get a bluetooth adapter for less than $20 bucks so don't waste your money buying the motorola cable. Also with the bluetooth adapter you won't need any special software to transfer pictures or mp3... just use the software with the bluetooth adapter).- the connector for the charger has the typical motorola design so occasionally you have to jiggle it to get it to fit in just right but make sure that your PRESS the button on the connector before removing it or else you will damage the contacts... this may be why some users are having problems charging their phones- the phone only comes in blue so it does not look as cool as other motorola phones like the v180 or the razorAll in all this is the best phone that I have owned.  User's who complain about call drops and bad signals should be complaining about the carrier and not the phone.  Personally I have noticed that ever since the Cingular and AT&T; merger, signal quality and call quality have both declined.  A Cingular rep told me it is temporary until they are able to better integrate both networks... this makes sense because I have only had this problem since I switched my SIM card to the new Cingular SIM that makes use of both networks.",positive
"I've had this phone for about four months now, and I haven't had a single technical problem with mine, even after a couple of typical drops on paved surfaces.  I do charge it every night; however, I've found that the Bluetooth radio makes a very significant difference in battery life, which may spur some of the complaints about the shorter battery life than the V400 (no BT capability on that one).  It is possible to turn off the BT radio if you don't need it for any accessories or connections.  My charge lasts for several days if I do this.  I really don't feel inconvenienced by charging daily and leaving BT on, though.In general, the phone has great screen quality (compared directly to my friends' V400s), great speakerphone and polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality at both ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful with headset), and I'm entirely satisfied with the camera, considering it IS a cellphone camera.I'll admit the interface was a bit cumbersome at first, but it's VERY customizable with changeable function keys, shortcuts, and menu orders.  I find mine very efficient since I've tweaked it to suit my tastes and usage.Additionally, contrary to some previous reviews, I have successfully transferred both information (phone book, etc.) and media (pictures, ringtones, etc.) to and from the phone with my Bluetooth adapter on my PC, without using Cingular's services.  I did have some trouble getting it to work initially, but I found that it was my firewall getting in the way (remember, Bluetooth IS a network connection).I suppose my one complaint is the conspicuous absence of games (only comes with a Bejeweled demo), but in the end it doesn't really bother me.  I could buy a game for $4 if I really wanted one.Overall, I find the phone very feature-rich and high quality, efficient to use once customized, and as rugged as the average cellphone.",positive
"My chief complaint with this phone is that the Ringtone selector is accessible from the outside of the phone which causes it to be changed when simply handling it or fiddling with it in your pocket. There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure. This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before. I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling. I have gotten more drops on this phone than any other but i have never used cingular before so i don't know whether its the service or phone. Overall i want to like the phone but i'm searching for something else as the frustrations arent worth it.",positive
"Bottom LineStrongly recommended.  This phone replaced a highly-rated NEC 525 so my assessment is largely in comparison to it.  Based on my research, the V551 has virtually the same features as the much more expensive Razr V3(although not as thin and made largely of plastic rather than brushed aluminum).  From the many online reviews I've read, early versions of the V551 had problems with lockups and dropped calls.  I haven't seen many of those types of comments lately so I'm assuming Motorola worked the kinks out.Pros--Very good reception and sound quality.  Gets three and four bars in my office; I had to stand by the window to use the NEC--It's nice looking; the body is mostly plastic but appears solidly made (the NEC was plug ugly).  Nice raised number keys.--Calls and rings can be made very loud (which is good since I often carry it in a pocket or briefcase, or have it in the car with the sunroof open and music blaring)--Decent quality pictures for a phone camera--Bluetooth--MP3 ringtones; also extensive selection of built in ringtones (although most aimed at young users rather than professionals).--Good speaker phone function--EDGE makes for fast web browsing--Excellent procedure for downloading and saving data via WAP--much easier than the NEC--I can now access Hotmail which I couldn't with the NEC--Nice looking screen--ITAP text entry system works better than the similar function on the NEC--Good voice dialing (the voice tags on my NEC simply took me to that phone book entry and didn't actually dial which the Moto does)--Ability to change ring volume and method (to include a useful vibrate then ring method) with external keys is very handy; ring volume can be made very loud--Buttons and functions are highly customizable--Very good date book--Quad band (I've used my NEC and the Siemens it replaced in about a dozen countries, including Iraq)--Nice price ($74 from AT&T;)Cons--Organization of the phone book is a common complaint but once I figured it out, it's fine.  You can store five numbers and an email per entry. (You must save entries to the phone not the SIM, and organize by primary listing).  It's not the best--the NEC allowed multiple emails plus other information--but it works.--Battery life is also a complaint but I found that by following Moto's recommendations--completely discharge and re-charge it the first few times--it's fine.  Now I can go 3 to 5 days between charges with normal use.  (As another reviewer noted, the battery life was short for the first few days I had it but then improved dramatically.)--Physically the V551 is a bit thick compared not only to my NEC but also to my previous Motos--a Star Tac and V60.  But it does fit in a suit jacket pocket--Speaker phone function can only be turned on during a call, not before--Maximum time before the screen turns off for power saving is 20 seconds.  You have to touch a key to make it come back on.  This can interfere with things like downloads--Screen icons are small and fuzzy; the user's manual doesn't explain what they are--Small navigation keys, but that's the price you pay for a relatively small phone--Of the three built-in skins, two are glaringly bright and tacky.  As with the ringtones, Moto was clearly focused on young users rather than professionals--When using a Bluetooth headset, the V551 will only use a cheesy, stock ringtone--personal ones will not work--You have to go through the recognition routine with a Bluetooth device every time you use it (although this only takes about ten seconds).--Works great with a Moto Bluetooth headset but I've had less luck linking with a non-Moto Bluetooth adapter for my computer--Lousy user's manual--Lousy user's manual--Did I mention the lousy user's manual? (this is inexcusable)--Voice dialing is not universal.  In other words, it ""learns"" one voice rather than responding to anyone saying the correct word or phrase.--Stubby antenna (although this is a trade-off: I get better reception than with the internal antenna on my NEC)--I would have been happy to pay the extra fifty cents or so it would have cost to have real metal on the front instead of plastic made to look like metal.--The synchronization software (Motorola Mobile Phone Tools)and cable cost extra.  I have not been able to make it function.  Motorola's support is utterly worthless--I asked for help online and they told me to call them.  Two attempts led to disconnects after 10-15 minutes on hold without ever getting to an actual tech person.  The software developer--BVRP--is trying to help but hasn't been able to fix the problem.  I may seek a refund from the online vendor and look into alternative sync software.",positive
I didn't like it but my husband seems to think that it works great for him and uses it often.,positive
"I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.$10?  I'm buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom.  The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that won't let them adjust the volume?",positive
"This model, the C150, is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered. I continued to try different Jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality I have ever used, however, all 4 Jabras had very poor microphone quality. With each one, the persons on the other end could not hear me. Disappointed. I found that it worked well with a cell phone, but not with a cordless phone.",positive
"The only downside with this headset is that the first one I owned broke after about 2 years of use. First the ear ""hook"" piece broke off. Then the 2.5mm jack broke while in a plug - I'm only glad it was in an adapter and not my phone at the time or it would have ruined the phone.I bought another one and it works fine. Hopefully that broken 2.5mm jack was a one-time thing. Otherwise the sound quality and fit are great. The reviewer who says the ear piece is too snug should use a smaller ear piece - there are 3 different sizes that come with the headset for each ear.",positive
"These did not work since the day I got them.The right earbud never had sound.I got a replacement, and it's the same situation.I am not sure if it's because I'm using a Nokia E71x, but they both don't work properly.",positive
"There's a problem with the design of this headset. The jack used is too short. It's EXTREMELY sensitive to movement. If you don't have it plugged in ALL THE WAY and keep it still, you'll loose the connection. I don't know why they designed it that way...",positive
"I purchased this headset from BTO, Inc to fit thePalm Centrosmartphone, which as a 3/32"" (not 1/8"") headphone jack. This headset fits and works perfectly.If you are familiar with the mono headset that shipped with older Palm or Handspring Treo phones, this headset is a stereo version. The buds are hard plastic in-the-ear type with a thin cushion (which you must install without tearing). The microphone is on the left bud, and is held close to your mouth because the left side wire is much shorter than the right side. The mic has an answer/hang up button. And the set is terminated by a 3/32"" four conductor plug.The build and sound quality of this set are good. The plug has strain relief and the wiring is thin but more rugged than expected.  The buds have bass ports and the mic capsule is a reasonable size. The Centro has a microSD card for storing MP3 tracks, and this headset does a good job reproducing the dynamic range of classical music.There are better headsets available. But if you want a headset to fit a stereo Treo with a mic, answer button, and decent sound, it's hard to find one that costs less. Four stars instead of five because the bud cushions are thin and tear easy.",positive
"Great sound, I use my phone for music at the gym so I am moving around and I have had no problems. To get it any cheaper, you have to steal it!",positive
"I doesn't hold a charge for very long which is to be expected for an inexpensive battery.  You really do get what you pay for, don't you?",positive
Great price for Motorola branded batteries.  Works great and seems to last as long as original battery did when new.,positive
The first battery received lost it's charge overnight..the vendor replaced it with another look alike that is working better.Not totally happy with the quality but the vendor was responsive and that is important for discount item transactions like this.,positive
"Oem battery, works great and received in just 3 days! Love the razr but original battery died, bought an aftermarket, it only lasted 9 months, so back to OEM.",positive
"I lost the charge for my Motorola RAZR V3, and I found this cheap one, surprisingly, it works so great that i asked my frds whoever lost the charger to buy from eforcity",positive
"I read other reviews before I've bought this battery and decided to try my luck anyway for 7 bucks :) so, I'm here to tell you that it works nice to me, I own it for the month already and still I have 3+ hours for talking and 3 days for stand by!!! Isn't it great?! Of Course it is :)I'm glad that I've tried it, I was even thinking if it won't keep the power for 3 hours for talking I'll need to go in AT&T; store and by original one for $40, the old one that was going with one kept the power for one and a half years. Will see for how long this one will leave.",positive
Anywhere else this battery costs at minimum 4 times more. Even with the shipping it's a steal. Grab two or three for backup.A-1 service from A-1 Accessories.,positive
I was leary about purchasing the battery because it cost so little.  But I called the vendor and asked if it was a new battery and not used or re-conditioned. The vendor assured me it was a new battery.  It has performed well so far.,positive
"I bought this thinking I was walking into a bad deal. However, it has been a great battery. I must say, for the price, I was extremely well pleased.",positive
"I should clarify my review title by saying that this battery is pricey compared to the non-Motorola batteries which mostly received negative reviews. I know someone who bought one of these and had good experience. However I decided to pay more and go for a Motorola replacement. It works well. If it lasts as long as my original Motorola battery (1.5 year), I'll be very satisfied.",positive
"Replacement batteries are working great.  They take a charge, hold it, and last seemingly as long as the original when it was new.",positive
"I had my doubts because this product was priced so cheaply, but it has performed very well now and has given my phone noticeable life.  I would highly recommend this product.",positive
Can't go wrong for under $25. I bought this when it was $40 and I've been very happy. I replaced my Jabra headset after I lost it. I think this is actually more comfortable. I've never had any of the issues described here. It's seems to be very clear and nobody on the other end has ever complained about not being able to understand me. Maybe I just talk louder than everyone else. :),positive
"Battery powered so no charging. Item delivered on time, was as described. It works perfectly with very true sound and easy to pair to my phone.",positive
"This is my second bluetooth headset so I am able to compare this with my previous one (a Plantronics M2500).  Overall it is not a bad headset but it does have some flaws.*** Plus points include:***- uses a single AAA battery so there is no need to lug around a charger when traveling.  This alone is reason enough to make many people consider this headset over others.- Great battery life.  I don't understand the user that complained of only getting 1 hour of standby time.  Normally I get about 5-7 days standby with 4-5 hours talk time on a AAA rechargeable that is already somewhat depleted.  A fully charged AAA or a AAA alkaline should do far better!- fits snugly on the ear and is relatively low profile...although some users are right in that occasionally it feels like it might fall off the ear even though it is snug.- Great price from Motorola dot com.  I got this for $23 bucks with a leather pocket clip (including shipping).- No internal battery so you won't have to throw it away when the battery dies (the plantronics has a non replaceable internal rechargeable so when the battery dies in 1-2 years you will have to buy another headset).*** Negative Points Include: ***- The side multifunction button is too easy to press accidentally so occasionally I end up redialing the last call.- The plastic is a little too lightweight so if you drop it, it will get scratched.- Switching ears is not as straightforward as it was with the Plantronics headset.  You have to remove the earpiece clip and then reprogram the volume buttons.  It doesn't take long but it is still a hassle compared to the Plantronics which only requires you to rotate the rubber ear insert.- The volume is definately not as high as the plantronics headset but it should be adequate for most people in most situations.- The light does not give you any clue as to the status of its battery.  The Plantronics will start flashing a red light when the battery gets weak whereas the motorola just starts beeping.  Great if you have it on your ear but not so good if you have it sitting on your desk or in the leather pocket clip.- The motorola does seem to have a lower range than the plantronics. I am not sure if that has to do with the battery not  being fully charged but I was able to use the Plantronics downstairs while my phone was upstairs whereas the Motorola will lose the connection as soon as I get to the base of the stairs.Overall the Motoroal HS805 is a great headset for first time bluetooth users or for anyone who travels a lot or talks a lot and does not want to lug around a power adapter, but if you want a lot of the latest features then you should look elsewhere.",positive
"The battery life on this unit is great. I can use it daily for an hour or so every day, on a single AAA for at least two weeks. (It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot.)I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone, and a Apple PowerBook G4. On the Apple, I can use it as a generic output device. (I'm sure the same goes for other headsets.) The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away; on the Treo 650, the signal is not nearly as good.The sound is OK. It's not the best. If it's noisy -- e.g., like driving, or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing full-blast  -- OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly, then it's sometimes hard to hear.It'll drop audio -- i.e., the call goes back to my cell phone -- when the battery is getting low. You can milk it a while longer, but that's really your first clue about the battery.The earpiece is OK; it's not as secure as I'd hope. If you're outside in a gust, you may want to hang on to it.Also, people on the other end sometimes can tell I'm on a headset with this one -- they mention that I sound a little staticky.This is my first bluetooth headset, so perhaps my rating is higher just because it's a nifty gadget. But the battery life on this is really the winner -- my work-mates have rechargeable headsets, and it seems like they're always having to charge them. I use rechargeable NiMH AAA's, and they just last a really long time with this unit.",positive
"I bought a different BoxWave Patent Leather Clutch with magnetic closure and was so impressed by it's functionality. BoxWave changed the style to a snap closure and I didn't realize it until I received it.I'm not taking stars away because of my mistake, but by the usual problem I have with snap closures. I have to spend extra time trying to snap it together because it doesn't just close on its own like with a magnet.The case also had marks inside under two of the stitches and shows mark on the patent leather as soon as I run anything slightly against it. I used this case once, maybe twice, had to return to the magnetic BoxWave leather clutch instead.",positive
"It's shiny which is pretty but that makes it a fingerprint magnet. Its just okay. I buy a lot of cases for my phones because I like to switch them out a lot. This one is nice for the times when you want a dressier case. For everyday I think I will stick with real leather cases from Zenus. They cost a lot more but they they wear well too IF you buy their real leather cases. The case cover creases if you accidentally run your fingernail along it. It's permanent crease. Its bulky so it protects but makes the phone too big. I used to love BoxWave, but this one is a little disappointing.  Why buy a cheap case for your $650 phone.",positive
This is a nice case that resembles a wallet because it holds your credit cards and papers while still keeping your Galaxy Note II protected.,positive
"Samsung Note 2 lets face it is a large phone... Howeva I am all about putting it in nice cases. This case hits a stars. Has a credit/ID slots and a money slot - Love that - so I don't have to carry a purse. Plus the strap is nice to have on wrist while on the phone (you know how crazy people are now a days running by snatching phones, extra secure). Best parts phone is secure in case holder when flip case over open. There is an appropriate hole in the back of case for the S-pen removal. Also the phone button closes versus most magnetic closure cases out here.Only con: No Speaker hole in front to close case while talking on phone.Howeva regardless -- highly recommend. Might get another in another color.",positive
"Bought this for my girlfriend's s3, and she loved it. Having that wrist lanyard is really helpful, and it is a nice looking case for the phone. Fitment is perfect. Also the slick outer sheen is pretty easy to clean off when stuff gets on it, however its somewhat easy to leave indent marks/scratches on if left in a purse with pens or anything sharp.One thing I hadnt noticed from the sellers page was that this case is held together by a snap. It seems like they have now added one picture in which you can kind of see it from the side. This is no a problem, it holds well, but a magnet might have been nice.The only real drawbacks are that when you keep the cover closed for a while, it may leave small horizontal smudge marks on the phone from the card pockets. Also extended use of the phone in this case will cause it to heat up faster than on some of the other cases I've tried. Both of these can be mildly annoying, but arent really a big problem.",positive
The product was OK however the material is somehow cheap looking leather. I am expecting something with more natural feel on it and not the one with shining look.,positive
I LIKED THE CASE VERY MUCH = BUT I NO LONGER HAVE THE PHONE = SO THE NEW BUYER THAT BOUGHT IT FROM ME AND THE CASE.,positive
This is the perfect case for my phone. Even  having a big phone the case makes it feel small and easy to handle.It gives great protection can even take a drop or a slip out of the hand. I love this case the black patent leather makes it a very stylish case.,positive
Its cheap the wristlet is like a little thread and not sturdy at all. You have to clip your uncased phone into the plastic backing attached 5o the purse. Money part needs length to really pack some cash in. Id like a better cash compartment which is one thing I wanted in my purchase.  Id say purchase a cheaper product like this. Id the wristlet breaks and im positive it will your product is pointless.  Buyer be aware. Update. I stopped using this. The same day I got this my phone was kind of stuck in it and without thinking I was madly pulling at it. Needless to say my note 2 went flying and cracked the screen to pieces. Just be careful handling your phone since this privides no protection and can be tough to disengage from the phone.,positive
Will take nothing away from the product.  For my personal taste it was a bit bulkier than I prefer. Quality is good no complaints otherwise.,positive
"This case not only looks fantastic, but it very functional and convenient to carry all the necessities (credit card, id, cash, etc.)  it only smelled like plastic for the first 2-3 minutes after I opened it, which didn't bother me at all. Overall this case is awesome. It's cute, and seems sturdy and well made. Buy it!",positive
"this case is perfect, the shiny black is just what my girlfreind was looking for, looks sturdy enough to last forever, and there is mini pockets inside the cover, verry nice thanks",positive
"I actually like this case a lot. I was worried about the price and it being a TPU and all. I have to say, I have a feeling this one is going to last a lot longer than the Spigen Neo-Hybrid I owned for 3 months before it broke. And even better, I can fit all of my charging and headphone devices perfectly, unlike the Spigen. It doesn't make the case bulky, as it may look. It actually feels quite nice in my hands. Overall, I really like this case. If that happens to change eventually, I will absolutely re-review it!",positive
"i like style, wrist band, good close clip, but once put credit cards in its hard to close. phone stays in ok but if dropped phone will pop out.",positive
It's patent so very easy to scratch. However the case is cute. Seems to fit but phone has slid out on multiple occasions out of case.,positive
Bought it as a present for my mom to match her purse and she loves it! She likes it better that her &#34;signature&#34; case becasue of the quality,positive
Looks and feels like plastic. Like the snap instead of a magnet. Looks better in the picture than in person. Holding up great after a couple of weeks. .,positive
It was a very nice case. Well made GREAT color........ But I bought the wrong size. Had to send it back.,positive
"Not pleased with the first cover she ordered for her Samsung Galaxy Note 2, my wife is loving this one by BoxWave.  She loves the compartments for her ID, credit card, and money.  The fit is good, no problems taking pictures or talking.  She likes the carrying strap as well, and the case's flexibility.",positive
I bought this for my daughter to use on her vacation cruise. The magnetic clasp erased her room card and credit card. Kind of defeats the purpose of the clutch. It might be ok if you just used your drivers license phone and cash but people don't really carry cash and to have to have a credit or bank card reissued is problematic.,positive
"The BoxWave provides good protection for your Samsung Galaxy Note 2, and doesn't provide near as much bulk as the LiviTech Defender Double Layer Hybrid Hard Case.  I still would recommend the Samsung OEM Case over them all.",positive
"This is a great case for the Note 2.  I had been undecided about whether to use a cover such as this or a belt holster as I've always used.  I wound up ordering both, this and a REIKO case.  They both work good separately, but not together.  If you try to use both, it is almost impossible to remove the Note 2 from the REIKO as it becomes stuck due to the tight fit.  I decided to use the BoxWave exclusively and have not been dissatisified with my decision.  I simply slide the Note 2 into my front pocket.  And no, the phone isn't too big for my pants pocket.The pros for this case is that it makes the Note 2 look stylish, and due to the rubbery feel, it makes the phone feel quite stable in my hand; however, the rubbery feel doesn't interfere with it going in and out of my pocket.  If I had to come up with a con for the BoxWave Tuxedo Suitup case, it would be that due to its glossiness, it shows fingerprints,  However, they wipe off easily.In summary, I would definitely order one of these cases again.",positive
I received this item in Dec. Been using it since then. Wanted to make sure I liked it and it did its job. It is light weight and does not add any bulk to the phone while protecting it. Well worth the money. I am thinking of ordering a few more of these in different colors. :-),positive
"My favorite TPU case. Offers enough protection and grip, can take off easily and slip it right back on. I can slip a couple of cards and bills between the phone and the case if need be.",positive
"Adds too much bulk to my phone, hence I purchased a different case.  Also unlike the pictures on the site, the buttons on your phone will be covered.  The areas on the case where the power button and volume rocker are located are covered by plastic.  Not good in my opinion.  Makes it harder to press those buttons.  Might be preferred by those looking for a good amount of protection for their phone.",positive
This case is a little thicker than my old TPU slim case but I expected that and really like the firmness of the material used.  No gaps or flimsy rubber on this.  This is my everyday case now.  Fit and finish as great and feels good in the hand.,positive
"Case is very nice, great, solid fit. The feel is very nice and minimal size. The buttons seem to be a bit hard to press for me, volume and on/off, but probably just need to get used to the feel. Nice case, good build, solid fit. Slides in to pocket without issue.",positive
"This case has a tackle touch which makes it nice to carry. Not worried about dropping the phone.Fits well and works just fine,  thank you very much. .",positive
"Fits well, offers decent protection and gives the phone good grip at a good price. I would order this case again.",positive
"This thing is sweet. I have to say that so far this is the best case that I have tried out from Box Wave. It slipped on very snug and was even harder to get off. Although it is not impossible to get off it is difficult which is a good thing in my book. This case is very comfortable in the hand and just feels right. All controls were easily accessed and everything on my Galaxy Note 2 worked fine with the case on it. The only thing I didn't like was that this does not come with a holster. I like to use holsters and carry my phone on my belt. Well I did manage to find a holster from one of my earlier purchases for my phone and it fit the Box Wave like a glove. It was from one of those 2 piece rubber and hard plastic cases that Amazon sells for about $7.00. I can't remember the name but as soon as I do I will update this review so you can order this case and holster combo just for the holster. I have had the chance to locate the name of the case and holster and it is from ""Rhino"" brand. The ones I have were ""Black Rhino"". I hated the cases but the holster is a perfect fit for this Box Wave case.",positive
"Bought to replace another that I bought for my wife a year ago and it is great. Not heavy, stand work the way it should and it fits like a glove. Gives grate stability to the slippery side of the phone and allows for one handed function.",positive
"I have bought many cases for many different cellphones and this is the first case that compelled me to write a review.  This is by far, THE best case I have ever had.  It fits so perfectly, you'd think that it was meant to be a second skin for the phone.  and the fact that it doesn't add a lot of bulk, but feels like it will protect very well makes it that much better.  This case is worth more than double or triple the price.  I wish they made this exact case for every phone.  It would be my go-to case.  Please make one for the HTC ONE!",positive
"First, I'm a huge fan of TPU cases; and hate silicone ones.  There's a huge difference, in case you, the reader, doesn't know.  TPU is better... LIGHT YEARS better!But there are a lot of not-so-good TPU cases out there; and not because there's anything wrong with the TPU. Rather, it's because they're cheaply made, or not cut precisely accurately... that sort of thing.This particular case is the very epitome of precision cut.  It's perfect.  Every hole is centered on whatever it reveals beneath... the camera lens, the flash, the speaker, the mic holes, the earphone jack, and, of course, the stylus.  Note that there's no holes for the power button or volume rocker......and that, TRUST ME, is the way it SHOULD be!  So many of these TPU cases make cutouts for the power button and volume rockers, and that's a huge mistake.  If you've ever cleaned an old-style computer mouse -- you know, the ones with the hard rubber ball partially hanging down out of the centerhold on the bottom -- if you've ever open one of those up and cleaned one, then you've seen the dark kinda' fuzzy weird stuff that you must scratch off all the rollers and whatnot.  That stuff is body oil, mixed with skin cells, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with lint from the mouse pad, mixed with godknows what else.  It gets into and under and around virtually anything which humans touch......including down inside and around the hardware buttons on a smartphone!  And when that stuff gets in there, buttons stick, and phones either won't turn on or off, or can't have their screens awakened properly... or, one of the common ones which people often don't realize is caused by a sticking power button:  boot loops!Having a TPU cover which covers the power button and volume rocker helps eliminate that problem.  Of course, there's still the electromechanical HOME key that's uncovered; and if you look on YouTube you can find examples of phones which their owners mistakenly believe are broken, because their HOME keys cause weird behavior; but, in fact, all that's wrong is that over time the HOME key has gotten all gunked-up with the aforementioned body oil, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with... well... you get the picture.There's not a lot we can do about the HOME key problem (if it's a hardware electromechanical one, as opposed to a simple capacitive on on the glass), but we sure can keep the crap out of our power buttons and volume rockers with TPU cases that cover them......and this one does... and magnificently.  It even has nicely-molded buttons (as opposed to cheap TPU cases which just have a sort of bulge with a little bit of texture added to it.  This case is simply molded beautifully!This case is special for another reason, too, which many people, I'll bet, don't know about, and that's precisely how its sides wrap up and onto the front face of the phone: the bezel around the glass screen.  It's really nice, and very different from how other TPU cases do it.Remember that the Note II is kinda' unique in that the very, very edges of its glass screen  aren't like almost any other phone.  Most phones have a perfectly flat piece of glass as their screens; and then there's the metal bezel of the case which almost comes into contact with the glass's edge all-'round; and the top of the bezel is ever-so-slightly elevated above the flat plane of the glass screen, so that if you place the phone on its glass screen on a table, the glass, itself, it not actually touching the table because that bezel edge is holding it a millimeter or so up off the table's surface.Well, the Note II's glass is actually higher up (when it's lying on its back) than the bezel edge of the case; and, in fact, the very, very edge of the Note II's glass seesm to roll over and down toward the case's bezel. As such, if you lay the Note II on its face (on its glass, it's the glass that actually touches the table.  This makes for a bit of nightmarishness with regard to screen protectors; and one maker of them (REALOOK) manufactures two dry-apply versions for the Note II: one that sits on just the flat part of the Note II's screen, and so leaves a wider-than-normal amount of uncovered glass between the edge of the screen protector and the actual glass edge; and then they make another (the REALOOK ""3D"" screen protector for the Note II) that's molded to actually wrap over the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and ""hang"" down over it, so to speak, to make the protector's edge come closer to the case's bezel, and causing it to COMPLETELY cover the glass and its rounded edge.With most TPU cases, the TPU sides wrap up and over onto the face of the glass; and with totally flat screen protectors which leave a half millimeter or so between the screen protector edge and the bezel, that's fine.  The TPU case actually ends-up covering that edge and make it look like the screen protector is covering the entire glass.  But with the  REALOOK ""3D"" style screen protector that wraps over the edge, that other kind -- the most common kind -- of TPU case can cause the edges and corners of the 3D screen protector to curl or pull up.This BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp case is magnificently shaped so that its edge around the glass protrudes up higher than the plane of the glass, so that if the phone is laid on its face (on its glass sreen), the glass doesn't touch because it's being held a millimeter or so up off the table or desk.  But it gets better:  That edge ""respects"" the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and doesn't try to wrap up over onto and cover it.  Therefore, the REALOOK 3D screen protector's edges and corners remain intact and look beautiful.This is a very special TPU case... different from most others... and the only kind you can have, actually, if you use either a wet- or dry-apply screen protector whose edges go either all the way to, or over the edge of, the Note II's glass.Seriously, this thing is PRECISION... someone REALLY took a moment to figure out how best to cover the unusual Note II... and got it PERFECT!The only thing I wish it had was a matte finish back so that it wouldn't show such fingerprints.  The TPU cases out there that are called ""s-style"" or ""s-series"" TPU cases have matte finish on one side of the ""s"" shape on the case's back, and a shiny finish (like this case has everywhere) on the other side of the ""s"" shape on the case's back.  The entire back of this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp should be the kind of matte finish that's on those ""s"" cases, in my opinion; or there should at least be an option to get it either way.Sadly, those ""s"" series or style cases are of the type whose side wrap all the way up and over onto and touching the glass, and on the Note II, that doesn't work well with most screen protectors. Plus, many of those ""s"" style or series cases have uncovered power and volume rocker buttons. Most of them also leave too much phone uncovered around the camera and flash... none of which are problems with this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp; and so for me, at least, it's worth it to just endure its shiny, fingerprint-showing surface.Great case!  Best-of-breed, at least among cases that don't cause the edges and corners of screen protectors to curl-up and pull-up.  If one is not using a ""3D"" type of screen protector from REALOOK, though; if one is using REALOOK's other screen protector that attaches to just the flat part of the Note II's screen, then any of the other TPU cases for the Note II would be fine (as long as they cover the power and volume rocker buttons); but the thing is that few of them are made as nicely as this one. Seriously, this one is made very, very well... very precise. I just love it!Gregg L. DesElmsNapa, California USAgregg at greggdeselms dot com",positive
"Nice, looks with good & durable quality & price wise as well. Really works as described...for my samsung note 2. I do buy accessories online now...more way cheaper & find it no difference from what's on the store which are very expensive.",positive
"Does what it needs to do at an excellent price.  Fits well, seems rigid enough to prevent some damage, and the kickstand is a nice touch.  I don't know how well the kickstand will hold up over time, but works well.  The ridge around the front allows me to put the phone face down without it touching a table.  The case is pretty compact and still fits into the Smart Dock, although it prevents HDMI from registering.  So it charges and goes into dock mode, but doesn't seem to sit down far enough to engage the HDMI.",positive
Bought this for my daughter  for her phone and she loves it.  Solid case and easily cleaned with soap and water.,positive
"The Boxwave case I bought for my Note II (Bodysuit) has disappeared from Amazon. This is the same case but with a uniform glossy texture.  I had a Boxwave case for my Note I and it was great.  This new case is even better.  It is thinner and more streamlined, and the buttons work even better.  This doesn't have cutouts for the buttons, instead it has well-designed buttons of its own molded into the case that push on the phone's buttons.  I like this because the buttons work just as well but they are protected at the same time from crud/damage.  Cutouts for the ports/mics/camera/stylus are placed perfectly and sized appropriately. Lastly, this case is made from TPU, which is the best case material in my opinion.  It's firmer so it stays on the phone better than the soft silicone cases and does not pick up lint or stick to your pocket, while still offering some cushion when you drop it.",positive
"I got the product very fast and it looks and feels great one the phone. However it did interfere with my cellular signal and brought my bars down from 3 to 1 and sometimes none. I started dropping calls and the people on the other line said I was fading in and out when I was able to talk to someone. I took the cover off my Note 2 and my bars popped back up to 3 and I had no problems with phone calls anymore. I tried it again to make sure it was the cover, and sure enough it did the same thing as before. I had my partner try it as he has the same kind of phone and it did the same thing to his Note 2. So I had to return the case for a refund. It is disappointing because it was a great looking case.",positive
"Fits perfect, nice clean look, I am going to buy another one to leave it inside my car just in case.",positive
I love the way this case looks and feels. But I wish the buttons were a little more tactile and the side hugged the phone a bit more. Otherwise I feel quite confident in the protection and the kickstand.,positive
"This is a regular case, fit, I believe it's not pretty at all but neither bulky and the protection it's intermediate .",positive
"This cover is very nice, it looks expensive. well built, and built to last. I recommend this cover.  Get it",positive
"Not a very well made case, thought it would be of better quaility, hard to tell from just looking at it on the site.",positive
I've bought several hard cases for my note2 and this one is my favorite. It's easy to put on and take off (once you figure it out). I don't drop my phone usually so I can't say how it will do if you drop it but it only covers the back and the sides. it's a one piece hard case which I really like.,positive
"I'm very pleased with this case. One piece that slips on fairly easily. It's not real grippy like some but has enough grab that you can hold onto it. Goes in and out of my holder and pocket easy enough. The stand on the back works great! When the stand is closed it's flush with the back of the case so it lays flat. Some cases, with stands, have hinges and parts that sick out. The blue is nice and true to on line image. I really like it. The price is amazing!",positive
"Flawless fit, materials and looks. Mixing clear and frosted materials looks really cool. Adds almost nothing to the width, thickness and weight. Volume buttons a little hit and miss though if you're not looking at the phone while trying to raise/lower the volume. Would have been really flawless if it had click-able volume and power buttons.",positive
Nice looking case.  Very inexpensive and seems to fit very well.  Excellent value and it feels good in hand.  A little softer than I like and therefore most likely prone to losing it's shape/tightness over time.,positive
"This is a good, inexpensive case. I use a case to make the phone less slippery so I won't drop it, and this one does a decent job.",positive
"I searched online for a case for my new Samsung Galaxy Note II, and decided on this product with it's cool design. It has provided sufficient protection and I especially like the grip-ability on the sides.",positive
"I always buy BoxWave cases for my phones, because they are well made, practical, comfortable and good looking. This time I am disappointed, the cuts for camera with flash, S-pen, speaker and microphones are too big and it looks ugly. Plus because the S-pen is in the corner of the phone and the cut for it really big, it doesn't provide good protection at this corner. What if the phone falls on this corner?",positive
"Great design and protected my phone really well from droppings. My one year old dropped it all the time and no problem. But the big problem is that it's stained. I don't know why I only put my phone in my purse, not my jeans pockets but it got all blue-ish note",positive
This is a great tutu and at a really great price. It doesn't look cheap at all. I'm so glad I looked on Amazon and found such an affordable tutu that isn't made poorly. A++,positive
"I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for dance class, she wore it today for the first time and the teacher thought it was adorable. I bought this to go with a light blue long sleeve leotard and was happy the colors matched up great. Price was very good too since some of these go for over $15.00 dollars.",positive
"What can I say... my daughters have it in orange, black, white and pink and I am thinking to buy for they the fuccia one. It is a very good way for exalt a dancer outfit: great colors, comfortable, looks great, easy to wear, durables and little girls love it. I think it is a great buy for costumer and play too.",positive
"We bought several tutus at once, and they are got high reviews. Sturdy and seemingly well-made. The girls have been wearing them regularly, including out to play, and the tutus have stood up well. Fits the 3-yr old & the 5-yr old well. Clearly plenty of room to grow. Only con is that when the kids pull off the tutus, the waste band gets twisted, and an adult has to un-tangle. But this is not difficult.",positive
"Thank you Halo Heaven great product for Little Girls.  My Great Grand Daughters Love these Tutu's.  Will buy more from this seller.  Made well and cute on the girls.  Thanks for a great product.NEVER BUY FROM DRESS UP DREAMS........I will buy more as long as I don't buy from &#34;Dress Up Dreams&#34;  I never rec'd or order in FL. Only rec'd pink, the purple one was missing.  Company is a rip off.  REFUSES to make good on purchase...... Real creeps.",positive
"Bought this as a backup to the regular ballet outfit my daughter has to wear. So far, she's using it to play out her Cinderella dreams but I am sure we'll be able to use it for a recital sometime soon. The quality is just fine for the price we paid. I was not expecting a designer skirt for this price and got exactly what I paid for.",positive
"Great tutu for a great price. It isn't a &#34;full&#34; or high quality skirt, but it is perfect for my daughter to wear over leggings for her little outfits.",positive
"My daughter liked this, and it with her costume, but she would have liked it to be a bit fuller.",positive
For what I paid for two tutus is unbeatable anywhere!  I ordered a pink and turquios and they are vibrant and beautiful! The tutu is very full! Princess style! Not cheaply made! Not cheap materia! Obviously someone made these with love and care! I paid less than 7 bucks for a tutu I and I feel proud of my self for researching to the point of finding gold!Recommend 2-6 years!My daughter is two ! Wears size 4t and this skirt ( one size ) fit perfect and will probaly be able to accommodate her quickly growing waist for some time!,positive
"Wonder my niece wears it every single day, yellow is her favorite color right now an this cute little tutu made he da. It is well built and we hope she gets lots of wear out of it.",positive
"My daughter has worn this skirt almost every day since she received it and it's even been through the washer along with the other clothes.  It's amazing quality!  She fits a 4T and it's just above her knee, and has a little bit of growing room, although I'm not so sure as much as others are saying.  But considering how often she wears it, I'm not worried! ;)",positive
Purchased this tutu for my granddaughter's first birthday.  It fit nicely with room to grow in.  I'm very please with it and will purchase more in varying colors in the future.,positive
Full and well stitched.  This tutu is a beautiful purple color that looks just like the picture.  It looks just adorable on our little fairy.,positive
"This was a gift for a two year old and a five year old.  The girls squealed upon opening the box, they grabbed the tutus, put them on, and wore them the rest of the day.  The tutus seem to be well made, and can stand up to handling by little princesses.  I recommend these tutus.",positive
"My 3yr old loved this tutu skirt in pink! Was hoping to order more in different colors.She had hardly used this,the stitching came apart in 2weeks.now it's lying in her closet..Altogether she wore it like 4-5 times for 20 mins or so.wish the stitching was of better quality to hold up while little ones wear it. Can't recommend.",positive
Perfect for my budding grand daughter ballerina! Beautiful vibrant color.  Fits great and easy to  clean!  I bought several more colors!,positive
Never GOT this item - but gave a 1 STAR because the replies from the SUPPLIER was GREAT.They tried to send the item more than once.My $ was refunded in a timely manner too.It was a shame I never got it for my daughter - it would of looked great with her OUTFIT for Dr. Seuss WEEK at school.Most original.Maybe next time.,positive
Nice and puffy tutu skirt. I would recommend this for girls under 10 yr. old.  It will be too short and small for older girls.,positive
"Our granddaughters are all very girlie, so when the youngest one received this for Christmas, they all wanted it!  Great color and fit for a 2 year old as well as her aunt who is 30!  I would recommend this tutu for all little girls.",positive
"Prompt delivery, and it is exactly as described.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I haven't washed it yet- so I don't know how it will hold up... Other than that my little girl LOVES her tutus (we got one in light pink also), especially spinning and running in them :)  She's on the little side, so my concern was that it would be too big, but the fit is perfect!  The elastic waist will expand with her as she grows.",positive
"The minute I saw this my heart skipped a beat. What a nice case to sort my collection. I love all the compartments and the layout too. You will love this color too. If this is a gift do not hesitate. It will please even the most fussy, as I am. The price is fair if you check around as I did. Seems well made too. It is suitable for an adult though. Not meant as a toy. This is for serious jewelry lover's. Buy it.....",positive
Love this Jewelry Box  so well put together holds plendy... Love the pink & looks so nice on my vanity.,positive
This products is great for anyone with a lot of jewelry my girlfriend has a lot and this gift for her was one of my best ideas! i recommend this to any one with a lot of jewelry,positive
"I already own this particular Shining Image jewelry box in brown, so this was my second buy. It arrived with some of the leather scratched, even though it looked like I was the first one opening the box. This particular color pink also looked pretty bad in person. The quality of this box seemed lesser than the brown one I own.I returned this pink case for a refund without a problem.  Got another brown Shining Image jewelry case and it's fine!",positive
"Really nice box, a bit cheaply made. It is made of carboard with pleather. Although the organization for all your jewelry is great, I'm not so sure how it will stand up to my tween daughter's use. Every inch is useable space for jewelry & very compact, which is a nice feature.",positive
"Since learning a language from software is not exactly the same as learning a language from going to live in the country itself, I suggest picking up the Rosetta Stone software 1 level at a time, like this French level 1. That way you know if you are able to learn from the software, before investing even more money into it. Since total immersion into another country to learn is not always an option, Rosetta Stone it the next best thing. While a class environment might work better for some, there's not always time for that either. Sometimes there's just enough time on the weekends, or in the evenings after work to get a few hours of studying in. Or maybe you just don't want to sit in a school like classroom, trying to learn from an instructor. That's where Rosetta Stone comes in.Rosetta Stone tries to be more than just a computer program. Instead it's interactive, and is a cross between software and an at-home classroom Spanish lesson. The software comes with a headset and microphone so that while you are learning, you also speak into the headset and respond to questions. The software helps one learn how to pronounce the words and practice what you've learned to help retain it. Unlike a classroom environment, you can work at this at your own pace, which I appreciate. When I took a Spanish class, some of the students flew ahead of me, while the rest of us were just trying to keep up. Rosetta Stone lets a person learn at the pace they learn at (fast or slow) so they don't end up missing anything along the way. I'm more comfortable learning from the program as well, than in front of a group of strangers .While going to France and living there for a while is probably the easiest and fastest way to learn French, Rosetta Stone is the next best thing, and a more realistic option for most people.",positive
"The product itself is five stars, however the description is faulty.  I researched this product a great deal before purchasing and even got the free demo CD first.  I really do like the learning process, it feels intuitive.  The problem is, sitting at my desktop computer is inconvenient and I do not have a laptop.  So when I learned that there is an ""App for that"", I was thrilled.  I own both an iPhone and an iPad so with the Rosetta Stone apps that link directly to my account I could learn and practice wherever I needed to.  For three months I made great progress whether at home, in the backyard or at work on my lunch hour.  On day 91 I suddenly could not connect, my apps kept saying ""no course found for this account"".  The product still works on my desktop but it turns out the apps portion of the product was just a free trial.  If I want to continue learning this way I need to purchase a very expensive subscription.  No where on this product page does it say that the companion apps are a trial version.  I am very disappointed with Rosetta Stone and Amazon.  I did call Amazon but the rep I spoke to did not know whether the product info was written by Rosetta Stone or Amazon, I am sure it was the former.  Amazon did try to assist me by offering a partial refund but that was not really what I wanted.  I want to continue to learn on my iPad!  My disappointed with Amazon is because that call I made to them took place about two months ago and I see the product info page has not changed, I do not see anything about the iPhone apps being a 90 day trial.UPDATE: AUGUST 23, 2013I see that Amazon has updated the description slightly with this sentence, ""Enhance your learning on-the-go with Rosetta Stone mobile apps for the Kindle Fire HD, iPad and iPhone. Three month access included with purchase.""  I personally think it is still obscure since the part about the mobile companion is much farther down in the description but at least it is something.",positive
"The first question was which computers to install this program - Rosetta Stone has a two seat minimum. I ended up putting the 2nd installation on a laptop, expecting to use the program in other locations.  However, Rosetta Stone's immersion method feels too intensive to me for use in most places away from home.  Installation was easy enough even though the program got stuck a couple of times along the way. The gear, headset with microphone, is sufficient.Pros:* For total immersion-type instruction without the benefit of communicating with other people, this seemed very good.* The voice recognition software is impressive. I was able to immediately begin speaking and progressed to the second level of difficulty fairly quickly. There are plenty of exercises and repetition, and this will surely help in many ways including pronunciation.* There are learning sessions in this software to allow speaking with native French speakers.*For me as an individual, this is a better way to learn than a formal classroom.Cons:* The limitation in the number of seats (2). This wasn't a problem for me yet it's something to know about.* Lack of matching supplemental physical material such as index cards with conjugations and grammatical rules. I feel the need for this and can source it out separately, but again I prefer to learn outside a formal classroom.* Lack of simple visuals to help with identifying grammatical patterns.",positive
"Okay, I admit it. I'm one of the millions of Americans that massively struggles with any language either than English. I have recently returned to college to finish out my Bachelors. The university I'm enrolled in requires two years of a foreign language. Ugh. Kill me. Kill me now. BUT with using Rosetta, I was not only able to get through my class without sounding and feeling like an idiot, but I actually got A's!! I never thought that was a possibility. I'm not ready to jet off to France or anything but I'm not a complete moron any more either. I'm calling that a huge success. Once this whole bachelors things is under my belt, I will be back to pick up the next level!!",positive
"I really enjoy the Rosetta Stone software; it's easy and fun to use.  The Rosetta Stone ""dynamic immersion"" method is different than traditional methods where you see a word in English and then see a word in the new language to memorize.  L'&eacute;tude du franais est r&eacute;ellement amusement et facile!",positive
"I've never had french, learned french, or know anything about French. Now, however, I feel like I could do OK with a quick trip and to get around conversationally. Rosetta Stone is no substitute for deep immersion learning, but it's pretty useful as a tool to learn the basics.Pros:- Builds a LOT of vocabulary quickly- Helps understand what words mean by associating them with a concept, rather than translating- Internet community is pretty cool.Cons:- Doesn't focus on grammar at all- Level 1 doesn't contain a whole lot- It's obviously pretty expensive. I guess if you're *really* interested, it's worth it.For it's purpose, it is almost perfect software. You will feel confident with the basics after this.",positive
"La Femme Boit...... I think that means the girl drinks. Learned that in the first 5 minutes. :)Ok, overall the program is good. This was my first experience with Rosetta Stone software and I like it. They really did one heck of a job making learning fun and easy. I highly recommend the software if you want to learn a second language, it looks like it is a good product. I would definitely try other languages after seeing just how easy it is to use this stuff.What didn't I like?For starters the headphones and microphone that came with it are NOT quality, they are not comfortable and my ears got really hot. It was like wearing styrofoam balls over my ear[...]. Sure wish they headphones were at least padded better. The microphone seemed to work well, my only gripe here is the comfort of wearing it. And if you follow this program you will wear it a lot!Second, it took nearly 30 minutes for me to install the software. I understand software piracy but between the lengthy install process, having to scratch off a 28 digit code from a little plastic card and manually enter that and the several updates I had to download it was a bit dull. I sure would have like a faster, easier program to install. So don't think you can just pop this in and you are good to go, you need to first install the application, then install the language pack, then update it (if updates are available) then you need to scratch off the secret code and activate the product, then you have to setup your user profile and THEN you can finally get started.Overall the product is good, I give it 4 stars out of 5 because the software is really the key here. The headset is low quality and that takes away from the experience. I would almost they NOT provide a headset then provide the one they did. And second the install was lengthy. I got the french lesson, I don't want to have to install the application and then a language pack. The software should be smart enough to install both the app and language pack together to make the process even easier.And yes, I am a software developer so when I review software I look at it from a complete implementation standpoint. Software is only as good as the installer.",positive
"The Rosetta Stone process gets you involve through what they call immersion right away, and I found it quite fun.  You run the application and learning CD's through your computer, plug in your headset/microphone to the USB port, enroll on line for the web support and community and off you go.You can hear it, see it, see how your respond, and it pretty much sweeps you along and gets you quite involved.  I have learned languages(the Romance languages) traditionally in school and self-taught over the years, and I found Rosetta very helpful and engaging.The negatives are the price, and this is only Level One.  It's a fine start, but if you're serious, you're going to have to do a lot more work and dish out for the next level.  Your call!May I suggest, for quick learning, say for a trip: get a tape/cd and a book.  Learn the quick, important phrases, practice some everyday- use it, use it, use it- hear it and say it, and if you can, practice with a native speaker- you really learn that way, and you get over the nervousness of being ignorant about the language and constantly fretting about making mistakes.If you're willing to pay the price and put in time- some of us just love computer, and it also includes an Audio CD for practice elsewheres, the Rosetta Stone French will give you a good, fun start into French or any new language.",positive
"I have had this product for a while to evaluate because I have so enjoyed the format and the refresher course. I have 7 years of high school and college French but like so many Americans, I never learned to speak or aurally interpret native speech properly. I found the visual and sound exercises extremely helpful and enjoyable. I have been through the entire course multiple times and found that I was able to put a DVD on ""French"" and actually understand much of what being said. I'm not sure I'd learn formal French grammar this way but I don't think that is the point of the course.I was disappointed that I could not get the speech recognition microphone function to work despite many weeks of attempts, use of customer service and other techie help. My computer is quite up to the task and so was I but I was never able to get that working. Even so, the parts of the course I was able to access were very enjoyable and enhanced my French skills. Merci!Based upon this experience, I'd definitely consider buying the next course if I could be assured the voice recognition piece would work.",positive
"Bring French to life!If your child is taking their first year of French or you are ready to head off on vacation and want to learn the language yourself, Rosetta Stone is a great learning tool for you both!  Version 4 comes with the learning lessons, headset with mic, app to use with your iPhone or iPod Touch for on the go learning and access to a virtual community online for lessions, games and chat!  I really don't think you can ask for more from a product.My only regret is that I didn't know about this product sooner! I certainly would have bought it for each one of my children throughout their schooling! What a GREAT product for homeschooling as well!",positive
"I got this product for my sister who enjoyed taking 4 years of French in high school.  Here is what she had to say about the product:>>>THIS IS AMAZING! I loved working with this product! I picked up on the words and phrases very quickly, and it was fun to do. They show you pictures and then show you the French word, pronounce it for you, and then you say it. It reviews the same things in different ways so practicing the words is not dry and boring. You can do it on your time and at your own pace. It also teaches you the four areas of language - speaking, listening, reading and writing. It offers activities that have you practice a combination of skills (reading and writing over listening and speaking), as well as lessons that focus on just one of the skills. I would highly recommend this product to my fellow peers! I am excited to try French Level 2 and learn even more!&lt;&lt;&lt;I asked her if she had tried any other language learning products that she could compare it to and she said she had not, but she was very happy with this.",positive
".When in the military,  I was stationed in Europe for several years.  The friends I made had a quiz they liked to use: ""What do you call a person who speaks three languages? Trilingual;  What do you call a person who speaks two languages?  Bilingual; What do you call a person who speaks one language?  American.I have wanted to improve my language status for many years.  My High School Latin teacher said that after I learned Latin, the other romance languages would be easy.  I considered the other romance languages (Spanish, Portugese, Italian. Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Corsican, Emiliano-Romagnolo, Friulan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Lombard, Mirandese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Piedmontese, Romansh, Sardinian, Sicilian, Venetian and Walloon), only the major four (French, Spanish, Italian, and Portugese were attractive to me, but then I saw this offer from Rosetta Stone and I chose French.Learning French was easier than I thought.  Of course the grammar I learned in my four years studying Latin made French grammar easier.  Well, and I did get a French grammar text and a French dictionary, since Rosetta Level 1 is limited in grammar.  After a few months using the interactive program, I began to feel comfortable speaking the language.I was tempted to brag to my family that I now speak French, then I realized that I had yet to converse in French with another human.  Soon I remembered my years living in Germany.  I had studied German, but could not really have a meaningful conversation with a German.  When I said something in German, they would answer in English (somehow they knew I was an American).  Those who did not speak English (maybe one percent of those I encountered) used a different dialect, and I was back to using my German book and pointing to words.  The lesson for me is that now I must spend some time in France if I really want to learn the language.  Oh well, I can read French as long as people do not get technical.Recently I thought of a possible answer to the dilemma I have with my European friends.  I could learn to speak Walloon, Friulan, and Arpitan.  I am unlikely to encounter anyone who speaks those languages, so no one to question whether I really know it.  Then I will tell them I am ""quadri lingual."".  Do you think that will work? . . . Neither do I.",positive
"If you really need to learn a new language, and learn it fast, Rosetta Stone is the way. I've taken college/high school and even junior high classes and learned. I took a Berlitz course and learned. But by far, the fastest way to a new language - and outside of taking one as a kid in public school - the cheapest way, too, is Rosetta Stone.No, I don't work for them or even get to date that spokeswoman in the tight blue dress. But I do love learning languages and I really like RS. Lots of options to learn so you won't get bored. Very little of the repeat-after-me stuff from normal classes. And actual fun lessons. Plus iphone apps and internet based learning. They have the bases covered.Ok, what I don't like - the complexity of the install with all the verifications and such. I understand the need to prevent software theft. It seems like, as usual, the legitimate purchasers end up paying the price ($ and install-wise) for the people that don't. Arg! I'm not sure how easy/hard it would be to install it on two machines or even how hard a reinstall would be should you need to move to a new computer, but I dread finding out!That little caveat aside - and it only pertains to installing the one time - this is a TERRIFIC product. It ain't cheap, but real learning seldom is. And the benefits to you are huge.",positive
"Never having studied Italian before, and never having used Rosetta Stone before, I was definitely excited to give it a go and find out what all the hype was about.I went through the whole lesson over the course of a couple of months, spending only about a day or two a week on it.In the end, I think it was a smart system, one that has specific advantages, but also marked disadvantages.POSITIVES:+++ IMMERSION TECHNIQUE -there is no English.  you will only see pictures and hear Italian.  This means you'll learn more effectively, as your brain is forced to make certain connections on its own.  Additionally, when you see pictures, for example, of a ""male"", the picture will be different each time: one time might be a young boy, and then it might be an old man, then a young man, and so on... and the first time you see the picture you might think it is a boy, but when the second picture pops up you realize that the word must mean something else, and you relate the two, and pick the commonality.  Anyway, this is a hard example, and it is simpler than this, but the idea is that you see different pictures representing each word, each time.++ WELL DESIGNED/VARIED -there are multiple modules which are scattered throughout -listening & comprehension, reading, pronunciation, typing, and so on.  It is impressive.++ GOOD REVIEWS -when I finished a section I was happy to find out that many of the concepts came back --not right away, but later when they weren't the freshest in my mind-- this meant I had to remember it, and basically memorized it through this recall.  I thought Rosetta Stone did a great job bringing up concepts and reminding me of the concepts later on.  I did not feel the need to review previous lessons...++ PAINLESS.  This system is about as fun (can I say that?) and as painless as a computer aided language learning system can get.NEGATIVES:--- PRICE, PRICE, PRICE -for most people the $200 cost for a single lesson (less as you buy more modules) is really too high.  Yes I know these things cost money, and I know they are better than other systems, but the pricing suggests that they are worried you won't like it, and you'll feel pressured to continue because you spent so much, OR, they are trying to convince you to pay only a few hundred more to get the whole set.  I'd argue they'd be better off dropping the price in half for the first module, and then I'd recommend it more.  (And give me some sort of discount if I buy lesson 2 separately.  I am not going to buy multiple modules without buying the first one, and testing it out.  $500 for the set is too much of a committment without giving it a shot first.)- READING EXERCISES ARE BUGGY SOMETIMES -I have spent 5 minutes (unsuccessfully) on several sections where I am supposed to say just one syllable, and the voice recognition system fails.  I mean, I KNOW what I am hearing, I have studied 4 languages, have good pronunciation, and I can't for the life of me get the computer to believe I said ""PO"" (for example) instead of something unrecognizable.  It was very frustrating, as I tried to enunciate it every way imaginable, with no luck.  Yet, when It was a multi-syllabic word (with the same syllable) the computer had no problem.- NO DICTIONARY -yes, I know this isn't part of their system, but it would have been nice to have a dictionary so that I could learn some additional words on my own.  (Sometimes you just don't want to wait to lesson 5 to learn numbers, for example...)But probably the biggest criticism is that this program is no substitute for classroom participation.  (Yes, I know that there are some online modules that you can pay more for, but I wasn't interested in paying any more...)My wife was taking classroom Italian at the same time I was doing this system, and we would compare experiences.  One thing I noticed is that the ""putting-sentences-together-on-my-own-and-saying-them"" part of Rosetta Stone, was one of the weaker sections.  She, on the other hand, got many opportunities to practice.  Mine was more about listening and comprehension.Overall, if classroom Italian really isn't an option for you, because you don't have the time or you just don't like classrooms, AND you have a lot of money to spend, then I'd say this is a good deal.  (If I were forced to move overseas I would definitely invest in the system.)But, if you are a starving student, then you're better off looking for other books and CDs from the library before trying this system.Recommended, but with reservations.",positive
"Although I haven't kept up with the lessons as I should have, I have learned a lot of Italian with only the first level. I spoke some dialect, but have conjugation issues! This is most assuredly the best program I've used to learn Italian. I have the older version too, and I like the new audio-visual matching; it's different from the older version and moves a lot faster.With this version, you can move at your own pace a lot easier, and see your mistakes sooner, which is helpful.Not only does this have visual learning, and learning by audio, but also by speaking, and comparing your pronunciation to that of a native speaker, which I think is the most helpful part of the software. The way the teaching of the language is set up, is I believe, the closest to learning it naturally with native speakers. I highly recommend this software...grazie!",positive
"I've always found learning a new language to be a huge challenge. Never was able to get past the bare basics in high school language classes (German) and, despite the fact that both my parents were born and raised in Italy, I've never been able to get much traction in Italian either.The Rosetta Stone software, however, is making a difference. No, I can't say that after using the software for a week that I'm fluent in Italian, but I am making progress. It's a very comfortable way to learn the language, especially since it's self-paced and offers tools (the headset/microphone) to help out with pronunciation, a particular stumbling block for me. Since I'm so slow at picking up a language (and self-conscious about it), I'm finding this type of robust, immersive self-study to be far more effective than classroom learning.A minor nit to pick -- I wish the headset quality was a bit better since it's such an important tool in the process. It's adequate, but given the price tag for the product, better sound quality and usage comfort would be welcomed.This is only Level 1 Italian, so the language skills taught are just the basics. Think of it as a way to get your feet wet with a new language. If you're serious about becoming fluent in Italian or looking for more than just the ability to ""try on"" a new language, then you'll want to get the advanced versions (unfortunately, at a much higher cost).It is a very fun way to learn a language. If you're willing to put in the time, it does produce results.",positive
"I was thrilled to get the Rosetta Stone and be able to begin a lifelong desire to speak Italian!The software was very easy to load and use. The simple approach to learning a language as a child does was one terrific idea!I agree with other posters that to become fluent you will need to purchase more than just this level 1 program. However, this does allow you to learn some simple things and I do feel you could communicate enough to get your idea across.And, it is FUN to do! I'm enjoying it immensely!",positive
I love Rosetta Stone it is easy to use in a few quick lessons you are speaking Italian. I like how the lessons are short and easy to finish.i like the pictures I can't wait to go to Italy.,positive
"Install Machine:Intel iMac 3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4 GB DDR3 RAM, OS 10.6.6Install was smooth and easy.  No hangups.  It immediately asked if I wanted to update after I installed.  It was about a 4 MB update and downloaded/installed quickly.  Need admin privileges to install software.  Total install time with level 1 language pack was maybe 20 minutes or less (there is a lot of data copied to the PC).Launching the software was straightforward and launching into the first lesson was easy.  The only issue I had was getting the included microphone/headset to work right.  It kept telling me to say ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5"" into the microphone, but it kept saying it couldn't configure the microphone.  I finally made some random noise into the mic and it worked fine.  In the lessons the mic worked fine.In the first lesson it was obvious what needed to be done.  I was slightly disappointed that the headset headphones did not play the audio, and instead the computer speakers played the audio, so why do I need a headset for just the microphone?  Oh well, no big deal, just different.I did the first lesson with my 5 year old son, and he enjoyed it a great deal too.  He quickly picked up what he needed to do for each lesson, but as a downside many of the lessons show only four pictures, so you can just start clicking on boxes until you get it right (an issue for my son).One thing I appreciated is the first lesson had absolutely no English.  It was only images and Italian words and speaking.  This is a better way to learn to make the association of the foreign word to the object instead of translating it in your head through your native tongue first.Maybe being level 1 it is easier on me, but I found I could be pretty far off in pronunciation and it would still accept my spoken words.  However, it is still nice to have some feedback if what your saying is close to correct, and this software provides that.I think this software is excellent, but the price of entry is high.  However, how much would it cost to take a foreign language class?  The textbook would probably cost at least 1/3rd what this software would cost.  So given the high price, I still think this is a good buy if you are a good solo learner.  Great for those who don't have time to take an instructor lead course.",positive
"Rosetta Stone Italiano Level 1Rosetta Stone Italiano Level 1 is easy to install and use. The included instructions are simple and straightforward. Activation required 2 tries, but it appears the code is only valid for 3 months so I suspect online access may be terminated after 3 months but the software should still continue to work.The pace starts off slow, but within the early portion of Unit 1, the vocabulary starts to pick up rather quickly. Since I am not a language expert, I had a hard time keeping up initially because different tenses of words, or the plural, were thrown in. Rosetta Stone relies on photographs to help you out, which is quite useful but I could not get a good grasp of the language to actually use it in normal speech. Once you start getting used to the phrases, the software begins to kick it up by throwing in more words. Unfortunately, like other users, the phrases are too simple for use in everyday conversation.The Level 1 kit includes a USB headset with a microphone to allow you to speak the phrases using the built-in speech recognition. This helps with pronunciation, although I found that it will disable my main audio and I have to switch back and forth. This isn't a big deal for most people, and there's no easy workaround.The box advertises that many Government agencies use Rosetta Stone, like the US Army and State Department. There certainly is value in the Rosetta Stone software helping Soldiers or agents learn a foreign language in the shortest time possible, but I felt it should focus on more useful phrases. 45 minutes of repeating various forms of ""Boys eating"", or ""girls running"" are not phrases that have much tactical value when you're visiting or operating in a different country.Overall: 4/5 stars",positive
"I was prepared to be disappointed with Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1, the first Rosetta Stone I've tried.  It was the voice recognition I was leery of. Though I've studied two languages through classes, I have no aptitude for speaking languages at all. The languages I'm most familiar with are the Teutonic/Germanic gutteral sounding languages; I have such problems with the romance languages. I married into a Portuguese-American family and they still howl with laughter when, after 21 years, I attempt the language.In addition, I've broken my ear drums a couple times, and have suffered loss of hearing as a result (compounded, could be, by age!).I am very happy to say that I have had no problem hearing or understanding the Rosetta program.  The included headphone/microphone combo fits comfortably and I forget it's on while going through a lesson. In addition, I've only had a couple times where I had to repeat a phrase because it was so off-base the voice recognition program didn't think it would pass as Italian. Now, granted, this may be because the bar is set really low for how authentically I speak Italian; but I would think that with a program teaching Italian as a second language, it would have to be. For most people, it isn't teaching you how to pass as Italian, it's teaching you how to pass IN Italian. And, if the voice recognition program was too fussy, I would get discouraged and just throw it away.Lessons start out with pronunciation, one syllable at a time, spoken and written.  Then vocabulary, spoken and written. Then phrases.  Total immersion, everything is shown on the screen in Italian and spoken in the program in Italian. Occasionally, you have to type in the answer to a question, rather than say the answer.  Everything is accompanied by photos. So your learning is reinforced in three ways:  you hear the phrase spoken, you see the phrase written, and you see a photo illustrating each phrase (a boy running, boys running).  In later lessons you dive into conversations with full sentences.Your Main Menu shows you which lessons you've completed. Based on that, you can access Rosetta Studio, which is practice with real people. Your main menu will tell you if any Rosetta Studio sessions are available at any point in time. You schedule a session and you and other students take part in a session lead by a native Italian speaker.You get a two-disc CD set for additional practice when you're not on the computer. I have used mine in the car, only occasionally feeling silly for ""talking to myself"". There's no voice recognition, of course. You are only repeating what is said on the CD.  The CD is divided into the same chapters as in the computer program, and each chapter starts with pronunciation, then vocabulary and phrases. Good reinforcement, though, I have to concentrate so hard on what is being said on the CD, that it's a little distracting for driving.If you have an iPhone or another iTouch device, you can download a mini-version of the computer program, including photos. I haven't tried that as my phone is a dinosaur.Included with your program is three months access to Rosetta World OnLine. I haven't tried this yet. From what I understand, after you've completed each chapter on the computer program, you are told how many games, stories and activities are available to you on the OnLine center. You can play individual games, or games with other players (learners) logged in, or with a native Italian speaker. Unfortunately, Rosetta World OnLine is only available 8am - 8 pm for me in Pacific Standard Time zone.  Many times I've sat down at the computer after the kids are in bed, and then it's too late.  If you're in the Eastern U.S., it's available from 11 am to 11 pm. After the three month introductory offer is over, you pay a fee, but I actually can't find what the fee will be.Incidentally, Rosetta Stone offers a six-month unconditional money-back gurantee, but according to their website, you have to order it direct from Rosetta Stone. I only checked the price for Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 and as of writing this review, the price is the same as the price on amazon.I am using this program on a PC XP with no problems.",positive
"I actually have used the Rosetta Stone Spanish Level 1 & 2 and found it great in terms of learning the language. At first, the Rosetta Stone method seems harder because you associate pictures with words and phrases but their whole premise is that is how you first learned a language by seeing something and then associating the word with that object or action. It is way better than pure memorization! I have gone through several lessons and I am picking it up rather quickly as I have a background in Spanish. Overall a great way to learn a new language!",positive
"I've been using this for a few weeks. Previously, my Italian was limited to stuff I'd see on ""The Godfather"" and a few foods. I'm a bit better now, and eager to see what the further levels of Rosetta Stone look like. Rosetta Stone is no substitute for deep immersion learning like living there, but it's pretty useful as a tool to learn the basics.Pros:- Builds a LOT of vocabulary quickly- Helps understand what words mean by associating them with a concept, rather than translating- Internet community is pretty cool.Cons:- Doesn't focus on grammar at all- Level 1 doesn't contain a whole lot- It's obviously pretty expensive. I guess if you're *really* interested, it's worth it.For it's purpose, it is almost perfect software. You will feel confident with the basics after this.",positive
"I have to admit, I was more impressed by Rosetta Stone than I thought I'd be. I learned French the old fashioned way (four years in high school and more in college), so the idea of taking on a new language in a way I had never tried before seemed like an interesting alternative.It was a lot more enjoyable than I thought it would be. I have a smattering of Italian from my family, and this added to it when I began to recognize words I had never seen before, but only heard.It installed on my Mac with no problems. I had a few issues with the microphone, but if you google it (there is help online), I found a fix that worked with little effort.I can't say Level 1 of Rosetta Stone is going to make you speak like a native, but after sampling this, it really does make you want to go onto the next phase, if it's as painless as this was.",positive
"I've had the opportunity to review several Rosetta Stone language software programs and have found them all to be quite good.  They all seem to follow the same basic structure which I find to be very helpful in acquiring language skills, and in this case, the basics of Italian language.  I've always wanted to know more about the Italian language but am not motivated to try and become fluent.  Level One for me, is just right.  However, if you are wanting to learn Italian in depth please don't just purchase Level One since it only takes you through some basic elementary language skills.No English is spoken, only Italian and I'm given a lot of visual selections from which to choose the action that represents what I'm hearing in Italian.  I seem to do fairly well having both audio AND a visual component to learning a new language.  Also, I like being able to speak my new Italian words into the included microphone and have the program correct my speech mistakes.  I haven't tried the 3 month on-line service where you can speak with a native speaker (tutor), maybe I would if I were trying to learn the language on a deeper level, but for me I'm happy with just the program itself.  After the 3 months are over you have to pay a fee and I don't like paying fees.I feel fairly confident that anyone who applies themselves regularly to any Rosetta Stone language program will learn a lot of the language being studied.  I find it to be a very natural way to learn a language.  Of course it would be best to be totally immersed in the Italian culture to learn it, but for those of us who don't have that option I think Rosetta Stone does a good job as a cultural immersion substitute.",positive
"I wanted a refresher course in Italian so I ordered this Rosetta Stone Italiano - Level 1.  This package is certainly unlike any other language learning program I have run across and even with brief usage, has yielded great results.  Although I have no major complaints with the program itself, the price factor did influence my rating.If you have issues with installing the software, I would check to make sure your pc has the latest version of software installed.  For example, Windows XP requires Service Pack 3 for this language software to work properly and Vista needs SP2.  It is easy enough to download the latest service pack with Windows but I hear mac users have more problems.  If you have an older pc, you really need to check the hardware requirements.  Also note that you must have broadband service to access all the features.The box includes a quick start booklet, installation cds, software cds, headset, user agreement booklet, keyboard stickers to convert for Italian usage and online services.  The quick start guide is important to read first and provides support online or by telephone (called about getting it onto my iPhone and received US based help without going through a phone maze).  The software installed easily on Windows 7 as did the included headset via usb port.  The global end user license agreement booklet was printed in microscopic print so I have my fingers crossed it is the usual stuff since I could not find a magnifying glass to read it. The stickers to place over the keyboard to convert it for Italian usage might prove problematic.  I had an extra keyboard that I placed the stickers on and could switch to when using this software.  I don't know if you would want this on your keyboard all the time and peeling it on and off does not seem ideal.  I think you could get away without using the stickers.This software helps with pronunciation (the headset has a microphone), builds vocabulary and phrases, and teaches simple conversation.  The software has 4 lessons in each unit covering: basics (unit 1), greetings and introduction (unit 2), work and school (unit 3) and shopping (unit 4).  Rosetta Stone advertises a learning application for your iPhone or iPod Touch but an account with Rosetta Stone's online services is required. Although the box states it includes free online features, they are free for three months only.  There is a $25 monthly fee  or a $149 fee for 15 months for online services after the trial period.  The 3 month trial starts the moment you activate your online account and you must be at least 13 to create an account.  I strongly suggest you use the software only and then use the online services to get the most out of this software.  The online services are great and allow you to access online tutors, games, and an online community to practice your Italian.  I really liked the options provided online but wished I had activated the free trial after I had gone through the lessons to get more out of it.  It's hard to converse or play simple games when you are just starting to learn Italian.Overall, this is a great tool to learn Italian if you can afford the hefty price tag.  For the same price you might be able to audit an Italian course at a local school but this software is more convenient and provides more personalized service.  Using this language software in tandem with its online services is almost as good as a private tutor at a lower cost.  I don't think I will continue with the online services given this is just a hobby for me but if you urgently needed to learn Italian, this would be worth the price.  I consider having friendly customer service available by phone a big plus.",positive
"I got Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 a few months prior to a vacation in Rome, mainly because the last time my wife and I visited Italy, we went without knowing any Italian and all... and that made for some frustration.I speak Japanese and some Spanish, so I am familiar with the challenges involved in learning a new language. However, Rosetta Stone made it easy and fun to learn very basic Italian. This allowed me to keep the travel book with frequently used phrases in my pocket when asking questions at shops and for directions, mainly.The main problem was once I asked in Italian the person usually would speak to me in Italian and I had to confess, in Italian, that I only knew a very little Italian. So at least they could understand what I was able to say! Thanks to Rosetta Stone I was comfortable not only listening but also speaking Italian because I had so much practice doing both.I'd give yourself at least 2-3 months before trying this in-country, but the pace in which you learn is really up to you. There are so many options that I didn't use... like the online lessons, the games, the community. I just didn't have the time for those and found the basic tutorials quite sufficient (and excellent) but it's great to have those options.",positive
"ROSETTA STONE is famous for teaching language the way little children learn language...naturally, quickly, without studying verb declention charts, memorizing vocabulary lists, or navagating grammatical oddities. However, there is an obvious problem with this philosophy that ROSETTA STONE has based their teaching method upon. The people who buy and learn from ROSETTA STONE are NOT 3-5 year old children. Any Linguist will tell you, children are hard wired to learn grammer, and to speak perfectly their native language. As we age, the ability to speak certain sounds disappears, and the ability to learn certain types of grammer also disappears. Once a child is past that stage of absorbing grammerical rules naturally, or pronouncing certain native sounds, the door shuts. You can still learn, but not perfectly. This is why a russian who learns english, will NEVER understand exactly how to use definative articles. Also, this is why Russian constanant clusters are impossible to pronounce for English speakers. There are almost NO exceptions to this, except for language savants i suppose.However, as far as learning language in a natural way, on your own, ROSETTA STONE is the best you can do. As anyone knows who's studied foreign languages in high school or college, you start with learning to pronounce the alphabet. Then, you learn the most common words, along with the way basic verbs (TO BE, TO HAVE, TO KNOW, etc) are conjugated, how the nouns and adjectives interact, etc. ROSETTA STONE turns that learning process on its head, and the center of its do-it-yourself language class, is the SPEACH RECOGNITION system. The RS Kit comes with alphabet letters for your computer keyboard (in case your target language has a different alphabet, than the English alphabet), and the computer files, plus four CDs to pracitice pronounciation when away from the computer. Also, the buyer recieves in the box, this headset w/microphone that plugs into the USB port of your computer.(plus a few simple instructions to get started.) Unlike the oldest voice recognition programs from a decade ago, this headset just sets the volumn level, and you are ready to go. Instead of learning to pronounce the alphabet, you just learn to speak the first words a baby might speak...""cat, run, read, boy, girl, hello, 1,2,3,4,5,6"", stuff like that. Rosetta Stone assumes you will learn the pronounciation rules automatically, ""BY EAR"". First, not everybody CAN learn strickly by ear. Some musicians can hear a song, and they KNOW every chord they heard, and the notes, and can reproduce them instantly, because they can PLAY MUSIC BY EAR. Other musicians need to learn what notes belong where on the instrument, and they need sheet music, and chord theory. WHY? Because some people are more right brain, others more left brain...maybe some people HEAR better, and others analyse better. So, if you are trying to pronounce the Italian word ""ZIA"" (Aunt), you will never GUESS it should sound like TSEE-ah. When English speakers see a ""Z"", they will not pronouce ""TS"", as in German, Russian, Italian, etc. SINCE ROSETTA STONE DOESNT TELL YOU WHAT THE ITALIAN ""Z"" OUGHT TO SOUND LIKE, you need to guess. THis is when the ROSETTA STONE voice recognition just doesnt work. You might hear TSEE-a, but if you see ""ZIA"", your brain will think it's hearing what it's used to hearing--""ZEE-ah"", and that's what you will say. AND, the voice recognistion WONT recognise the correct pronounciation. Likewise, Italian has other sounds not at all like English, and unless you have some kind of heads up on how each letter SHOULD sound, you may never get close to the correct sound. I have a good ear. But i couldn't hear that Italian has a more dental sounding ""D"" than english. I didnt know the other oddities associated with pronouncing the Italian language. At times, I would click on LANGUAGE LAB, where you get directed to a page that SLOWS DOWN the pronounciation of the word, as well as showing you the voice print, and how the native speaker's voice rises and falls naturally, during the pronounciation of the word. (Apparently for correct stress.) If you are 50% or less away from getting it right, you see a brown cirle that tells you about how close you are, to correct pronounciation. (Plus the system records your attempt at pronouncing the word, so you can compair what you are saying, to that of a native speaker.) If your circle turns green, you are 80% or closer to perfect pronounciation. HOWEVER, this system DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. Once, i tried to pronounce ARRIVIDERCI for 15 minutes. I was UPSET, then angry, then bored, and finally, dejected. Frustration kills motivation, and I think that's why problems with the voice recognition bothers so many people. IF i knew what was wrong with my pronounciation, at least i could TRY to figure out how to say it. I think this happens to EVERYBODY who uses Rosetta Stone at some point. The computer program doesnt say ""The Italian 'G' is PRONOUNCED HARDER THAN ENGLISH 'G'."" Instead, you are suppose to just KNOW this.  Sometimes, i just believe the voice recognition is just not able to read normal variations in pronounciation correctly. For example, ROSETTA STONE wants you to roll your R's. But, very few people even in Italy can actually make that sound. So then the voice recognistion hears the lack of rolling R's as a mistake in pronounciation. The computer program considers these mistakes as WRONG on your part, and at times the mistakes start to stack up. IF you dont get thru a lesson with a good score, you'll need to repeat the lesson, and also repeat the offending word. (the program tracks a LOT of parameters, including how long its been since you have taken a lesson. Too long, and RS makes you review things before you can start the lessons again. But that's good.) All I can say, is when I could not pronounce a certain word, i almost never knew why. Even tho ROSETTA STONE gives you 4 CDs for pronounciation practice, if you've an inability to say a certain word, you might not ever speak it correctly.My other problem, was that there is NOTHING in the kit, that explains GRAMMER the way you learnt grammer in school. Sometimes, those photos that go with the spoken or written exercise, dont get the idea across very well. THE ONLY SOLLUTION, is to buy some kind of cheap TEACH YOURSELF ITALIAN paperback book, that covers basics of grammer, pronounciation, vocabulary, and all the other holes in the learning of the language, that ROSETTA STONES leaves untouced. AMAZON.COM sells a pretty good book, very cheap, that would help anyone using their ROSETTA STONE class immensely. ""ITALIAN MADE SIMPLE"" by Cristina Mazzoni, for around $8 new. I bought that book, and only then, were the grammer lessons beginning to make sense. ALSO, this book spends time in the beginning, to teach the differences between the way OUR alphabet is pronounced, and the way the Italian Alphabet is pronounced. You NEED to get a book like this, so you understand italian grammer, and have a little bit of an Italian dictionary as well.There are a few other problems with ROSETTA STONE. Everybody says ""DONT SIGN UP FOR LANGUAGE LAB, UNTIL YOU GET THRU THE LANGUAGE BASICS"". Because, depending on how fast, or slow, you are motivated to move thru the lessons, those 3 months of FREE LANGUAGE LAB go by really fast. WAIT TO SIGN UP! ALSO, its good to know that you cant just sign up for language lab a day or two before you want to use it. THERE IS A TWO WEEK WAIT, to have a lesson. Besides the speach recognition problem, and the lack of a good text book so you can learn grammer, pronounciation and vocabulary the way adults learn language, everything about ROSETTA STONE's classes are LOTS OF FUN. Really. They have games that help you keep those new words constantly in your mind. There are stories that help with reading, that are clued into your number of finished lessons. ITALIAN LEVEL ONE, for example, is divided into UNIT ONE, language basics, UNIT TWO, Greetings, UNIT THREE, Work and school, UNIT FOUR, shopping. By the time you finish that much of the course, you should be able to get around Italy, and make basic conversation. I would guess your proficiency level might be FIRST YEAR COLLEGE ITALIAN, or two years of high school italian, or 1-2 Italian grandparents. ROSETTA STONE is very visually interesting, and will keep you motivated once you get past that first unit (language basics), so long as you dont have major problems being understood by the voice recognition software. I wish i had waited for the langauge lab, because i'm SURE that would have helped. However, if you don't use it as much as you want after the first 3 months, its only $25 a month, for more time with those online tutors. All things considered, VOICE RECOGNITION really DOES work remarkably well. I'm sure most of the problems people have, come from their inablity to pronouce certain sounds specific to their target language, rather than the program's inability to understand your voice. If you are speaking the language correctly, I would guess anywhere from 96-99% of the time, ROSETTA STONE understands EXACTLY what you say. If some word (like my problem with ARRIVIDERCI) comes up, you can easily skip the word. There is NO OTHER SELF TAUGHT LANGUAGE CLASS that can perfect your speach, increase your vocabulary, and engage you in an ""immersion"" type language adventure, like ROSETTA STONE can.  NO OTHER SYSTEM has the native speaker 1 on 1 language lab. The only REAL problem is if you learn on your own, its hard to keep your motivation for learning high. You'll need discipline and some kind of reward, ie, a trip to Italy if you finish LEVEL 1? (Or maybe just a FELLINI film. Whatever rocks your boat.) Good luck with your language adventure, and ARRIVIDERCI!",positive
Purchased this costume (size 3T-4T) and it's a perfect fit for my very tall 2 year old son. I couldn't have asked for a better fit if we'd tried it on in a store first. I also bought the inflatable jet pack/wings. Can't wait to see him all dressed up on the big day!,positive
"I purchased this costume for my 6-year old grandson for Halloween 2011.  It arrived one week earlier than expected, and I was happy about this.  My grandson absolutely loved it!  I'm glad I ordered the larger size (Size 8) because it barely fit him. The material was durable and well made, I think.  He's worn it many times just to play in since Halloween.  I was happy with the purchase which was worth the dollars I spent.",positive
"Everything perfect. Thanks, nice quality, excellent price, great deal!!! I recommend it 100%, the color and size are as I expected.",positive
"Good costume.  Very detailed.  I like that the body is a foam so it stands up a little on its own.  You might not be able to tell from the picture, but there are shin-guard type pieces for the legs, and gauntlets on the sleeves.  Nice touch.  It is a little thin overall.  You'll definitely want to put something underneath if you're in a colder climate.  My only disappointment is that the back of the torso is entirely black.  It's ok for us because I bought the inflatable wings, but without the wings, I think it would look weird.",positive
"My 2.5 year old got the 3-4 year suit. It's a little tight to begin with, so he fit in it just fine. The pants were a little longer, but with shoes, he fit it, no problem. (He is ""average"" height and weight, for a 2.5 year old, according to docs.)  If your child is ""meaty"" at all like mine is on top, I would suggest getting the larger size.After reading the other reviews about how flimsy this costume was, I didn't let my kiddo wear it until the actual day of Halloween. He ran around a lot but it didn't tear at all. I think it has a couple more good uses in it.If you are hoping to buy a costume that will last and will allow your child to play in it at home, I don't think this is the one. They have the $50 one that looks a lot more sturdier. But if it's just for this Halloween and maybe next year for the kiddo next door, then by all means, get this one!!!  For the price we paid ($35), I am very happy with the purchase and the pictures of him enjoying being the Heroic ""Buzz"" will last forever, even if the suit doesn't!",positive
This is one of the cutest costumes I've ever seen! My son loved being Buzz for Halloween and we got so many compliments while out in the neighborhood. The material is a little thin so we layered with a pair of white long johns and it worked great.,positive
"My grandson has been a costume lover for the past three years and I have ordered many from Amazon, His picture that his mother sent was adorable.  SO thumbs up",positive
"My grandson is 5 and I gave him this for Christmas. It has hat, suit and &#34;boots&#34; and he put it all on right away and wore it home. This is not a high-quality outfit but for the price it should get him nicely through this phase.",positive
This costume is adorable.  My child loves it.  He puts it on all the time and it's not even Halloween yet.,positive
"My son wouldn't wear it because he can be a stick in the mud. However, the costume is very cute, came within e boot covers, holster, bandana, hat, and one piece costume. I only wish it ran a little bigger so he could wear it in a few weeks or months if he ever lightens up and enjoys dressing up in costumes.",positive
my boy is almost 4yrs old and size chils s fits perfectly even with room to grow.boot covers are awesome! he loved them!.would definetly recommend this... for 10 bucks it is really great!,positive
better quality than I expected for the price - was able to adjust it so it hung at the side rather than straight in front easily - this was our 'go-to' passport storage solution in Italy where there were a LOT of pickpockets.,positive
"I bought this, but it is too large for me. If I put anything in it, it is very visible under my shirts. I ended up buying a runner's belt with a pocket and that works much easier to strap around my upper waist. I also didn't like the idea of the string around my neck being visible. Thought of it getting caught or someone seeing it and pulling it.",positive
"Exactly what i wanted as a gift for a friends 1st trip to europe.This is made from the soft kind of fabric that is comfortable to sleep with against your skin.Just the right amount of space to fit a passport and 2 additional sections of the same main pocket,for currency, credit cards, tickets, etc.It's important to get one like this that has no metal, so it can be worn through security check points,with metal detectors without the need to remove it.This is crucial as no one but you should know this is where the bulk of your important items are.The one main pocket is closed with a velcro strip.It also has a nice thickness to the cord and well chosen adjustment buckle for it.",positive
"I bought one of these neck stashes for my most recent cruise and used it everyday while on vacation.  You can adjust the strap to fit your taste. There are three sections and you can get quite a bit in it.  I stuffed cash, my passport, driver's license and several credit cards in it and still had some room to spare.",positive
"It gives you room to keep your passport (even in a leather passport coverAmerican Tourister Leather Passport Cover), credit cards, important papers, and even has room for some money, and keeps it in a secure place around your neck.  You can keep it tucked between your shirt and t-shirt for security and still get easy access to whatever you need in it.  It is of lightweight nylon construction that doesn't make you hot where you carry it.Don't travel without it!Pluses:Prime eligibleSmall, lightweight, but holds a good bit of 'stuff'Minuses:None at this time",positive
Love this product. Its small and fits over your neck and under your shirt. I used it on my receint trip to Ireland. Its a lot better then a money belt. Its a lot easier to get to your money or papers and it is harder for anyone else to get to. I will take it on all my trips from now on.,positive
"I bought this to replace another one I had that was kinda heavy (in comparison). I like this one MUCH better. The strap is long so you can wear it in a purse style or tighten it up and wear it under your shirt. Fits everything really well, and it's really light.",positive
"Used this on our last vacation saves from fumbling through your pockets or bags for passport or reservations. I loved using it, fits comfortable under your shirt. Had my passport, credit card and wallet in it while going through the airports.",positive
"This was a very handy wallet that I used in India.The color is near neutral so it does not show through a shirt but best to wear a vest or a jacket for additional safetyNice velcro closure keeps money safe.You can easily carry 1,000 rupee bills with comfortAlso can carry valueable documents or passports if you wishNice long neck strap that can be shortenedEasier than carrything a thick wallet in trouser pants",positive
Arrived on time in perfect condition. went on a 3 week trip in Africa and it was the perfect item to have.,positive
Once I found the special travel wallets for the front pocket I never used this again.  Fear of pickpockets is over blown anyway I think having been to the &#34;worst&#34; cities of Europe and Asia.  Just don't talk to people who take an extra interest in you because you are obviously American.,positive
"This pouch is lightweight and comfortable to wear, and I liked the very adjustable strap.  However, I would like for the pouch to be a couple of inches longer to accommodate the length of a standard boarding pass.  I was surprised that it was too short as it seems to me that travel documents would the the most likely thing to store here, but it could not be closed unless I bent the passes which then made them difficult to remove.  A minor gripe, overall I'm satisfied.",positive
"This is a Christmas gift for my sixteen year old son. He likes things basic, and this is exactly that. A basic passport and money holder for travel. The color is not like the picture at all, but I am keeping it and letting him decide.The very light beige will get dirty quickly.The zippered section is fine. I wish the passport section had a zipper instead of velcro. For the price, it is adequate.",positive
"I bought two of these pouches for a recent vacation to Europe.  It was comfortable to wear as long as I didn't put too much in it.  It was fine with credit cards, driver's license and some cash but when I added my passport it became a bit heavy and bulky, but not prohibitively so.  I think if you are planning on carrying your passport with credit cards it will work well for you, but if you are not planning on carrying your passport around, a pouch that is smaller might work better.This pouch is likely a good size if you are carrying quite a bit of stuff, but it will stick out under your clothes if your passport is in it.  A lot  more comfortable with only a bit of cash and credit cards.It is also a l longer in length than I realized.  Its so long that I could wear it around my neck and tuck it into my pants.  My daughter refused to wear it since it is quite bulky under your clothes.",positive
This is the type of pouch recommended by TV travel hosts. Bought one for my son for trip to France; VERY HANDY and VERY HIDDEN.RECOMMEND.,positive
"I recently used this neck stash on a two week trip to France.  It was wonderful!  I loved it at the airport and at train stations, especially.  It is so helpful to have my hands free yet my passport and bording pass (or train ticket) ready to pull right out instead of fumbling in a purse.  I also carried money and credit cards in it and in extremely crowded tourist areas (like the Eiffel Tower) I wore it under my shirt for extra security.  It's lightweight and the adjustable neck strap, when adjusted properly, makes this pretty unnoticeable under a shirt.  I love the different compartments, as this makes it easier to find what you're looking for right away.",positive
"This neck stash is very comfortable and it's a nice size. There are two zippered pockets for cards, passports, cash, etc. and a large velcro flap for larger bills or boarding passes.",positive
"There's nothing special here, but this is what I expected.  It's very light weight, and I suspect it wouldn't hold up to much abuse, but hard to beat the price.  My only real complaint is that the zipper pockets are only barely big enough for my passport, so it takes more concentration than I'd prefer to use them for passport storage.",positive
"Quality material, easy to wash and dry, lots of zipper areas and holds more paperwork and currency than you could imagine from seeing just pictures of it. Discreet and comfy to wear around neck for men or women.",positive
"I haven't used this yet, but I purchased it for my next trip. I already have a waist wallet, but I can't get to it without going to a restroom and partially undressing. This seemed much simpler to use.",positive
"I really like this. I ordered several different ones but this one is really convenient for the documents I want to carry close and safe where I can get to them easily,",positive
"I wore this one all over medetaranean.  I felt safe EVEN in the Istanbul Grand Bazzar, the most crowded, pushy, pickpocket attracting place on Earth.",positive
"Purchased two of these for a European Trip.  They were invaluable.  We placed our money, cards and passport in them and tucked them under shirts and out of sight.  Light weight and they DO NOT rub or irritate the skin which surprised me.  they are washable too!",positive
"the last time i travelled i got one of the waist ones, and it was so annoying i never used it.  i haven't yet really used this one but i already feel much better about it.  i tried it out when i first opened the box when it came and wore it for a bit around my neck.  i don't like the toggle, but i doubled up the strap and tucked the toggle in the top flap of the stash and it works great.  i also wrapped it around my calf just below my knee to see if that would work too.  it worked just fine and i might wear it there when i wear my boots. i'm not sure if it really needs all those different departments, but that's ok. i don't think it's too big or too small.",positive
"This has a lot of pockets and yet is very slim. Took this on a trip outside of the US and the item was lightweight, discreet and very handy.  Holds 4 passports easily along with receipts.",positive
"great  no one got my good stuff  It was all hanging around my neck.  sturdy and durable, i bought one for my husband",positive
"It might just be me.  Although it seems well made and sized right.  It just seems a bit flimsy to me.  I debate if I really should not give it 5 stars as it does everything it advertises itself.  When I travel out of country, I have this around my neck and under one layer of clothing.  I have my &#34;throw away&#34; wallet in my pocket with expired cards and a few dollars.I like the various pockets and zippered security to keep things in place.  The neck cord is a little long so I had to tie it off so the stash would fall mid chest making it a bit more concealed.4.5 stars - minus 1/2 star for long cord and a flimsy feel.  Again though perhaps being flimsy is a good thing being under clothing making it conceal more.",positive
The item arrived on time in perfect condition. I took a 3 week trip to Africa and it was the perfect item to have!,positive
"My 16 year old granddaughter was going on a trip to France for 10 days with a student group and needed some security that her documents and money would be safe. Worked just fine, also handy at airport",positive
Soft and really light.  Works really well and is very well thought out with 2 zippered pockets and an large Velcro pouch with 2 separate pockets.  I find this a very good arrangement.  Money in one zippered pocket and card and license in the other and the cell phone in the Velcro pocket. I also like the adjustment on the length of cord so you can wear it high or lower.  Not my everyday wallet as a full size Spec Op but this is great for days when more security is need or no pockets.,positive
"This is lightweight, nice material, easy to wear under clothing, secure place for passport, money, hotel key, driver's license. The strap is a little long so we just cut it off shorter. Perfect for detering pickpockets and not noticeable under a shirt (not so under t-shirts, but still safer than in a pocket)",positive
"It's too short to be particularly useful. If it had been about 3 inches longer it would have worked. The problem was when you tilt your suitcases on their side to roll them, this is so short that the wheels of the attached case come off the ground. The quality of construction looked good.",positive
"Highly recommend this product.  I was easily able to ""piggy back"" or connect 2 luggage pieces by the handles to easily transport 2 pieces of luggage with my carry-on resting on the top piece of luggage.  Have used this now 3x's and highly recommend it.Wish I had it for earlier travels.",positive
"husband needed this strap to be able to attach his briefcase to his carry-on luggage to make navigating through the airport to the gate easier. product fits the bill, is well-made so it should hold up over time. he's already road-tested on a couple of recent trips and is happy with it.",positive
"I travel 3 weeks a month and carry 2 50 lb bags everywhere I go.  I have been using this strap for a couple months now to pull both bags together and it works awesome.  I wouldn't go back to traveling without it and the convenience for the price is great.I can even get both bags, when piggybacked, on an escalator and the strap is strong enough to hold the second bag in the air without snapping or anything.",positive
"This is a must have item for travelers. Very sturdy, adjustable. Couldn't live without it for carrying multiple bags.",positive
it doesn't make for an easy set of bags to move about the airport.  Use it only id you have to.  A samrt cart is better,positive
"This would have worked fine if the buckles had bee the same as on my luggage, but they weren't, so I had no use for the thing.",positive
"I bought this item to attach the handle of a backpack to a 22&#34; carryon.  The strap is well constructed, but the minimum length is too long to avoid your backpack from dragging the ground when pulling the carryon. A laptop bag or purse is fine, but not anything as vertically high as a backpack.  I purchased the Travelon bungee cord for this purpose and will try it on my next trip.  I'd shorten the minimum length of this thing and it would be fine.  Otherwise, it will be fine with a checked bag coupled with a smaller carryon or purse/backpack. But for smaller luggage, not so much.",positive
"This adjustable straps fit around my messenger bag, which has to pieces of cloth on both sides of the front flap, and have sufficient length to secure it, as a back up to the velcro closures.  They have a heavy plastic clip that &#34;clicks&#34; to make sure they close.  Very useful.",positive
"Good for connecting one bag to another, but likely to get lost at some point.  I am using to connect my laptop bag to overnight carrier, I am anticipating loosing or forgetting it somewhere.",positive
"If you're trying to connect two 50 lb suitcases together, this is not the strap to use. Look for the Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker, Black, One Size.This simple buckle and strap looks easy to use but it isn't. When you're in a hurry and you need to adjust the tension on this strap, you're fussing around with it in baggage claim. The Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker has extra ""tongue"" to quickly pull on (like a backpack strap) so you can clip, pull to tighten, and GO.This Lewis N Clark strap is good for light loads and smaller bags.  For larger ones, this one was a pain to use. You get what you pay for. Choke up the extra $5 and get the Travelon, you'll be glad you did.",positive
"We got several of these before our overseas (by plane) trip.  They came in very handy for stacking the bags and luggage we had to manhandle through customs, airports, into taxis & B & Bs, etc.  They were very easy to use & sturdy, and I recommend every traveler carry a couple for unexpected needs (to bind more than one thing together for easy carrying).  I used one every day in the rental car to hang my bags on (hung it from the head rest) so items didn't get tossed and lost.",positive
"I bought two of these, and we have used them both multiple times.  They are made well and the clip is heavy duty.  Make sure to use it with a strong handle on your suitcase, as the design is such that it pulls significantly on the handle when carrying the second suitcase.  This item is also useful to attach other items, such as on small carryons or your travel pillow.  Two of these belts were VITAL to my international travel alone with a toddler and tons of suitcases/stroller/carryons/car seat, etc.  They helped to strap items together for easy transport, and I was able to get through the airports with everything in tow.  I highly recommend them!UPDATE FEB 2012:  I have used these straps on multiple trips and they have held up well.  At one point I used the strap on three suitcases at once, including a large rolling duffel bag, a large suitcase, and a medium suitcase.  It kept everything together and I was able to navigate through international airports with multiple suitcases strapped together, car seat, diaper bag, backpack, and toddler (in an Ergo baby carrier).  Without this strap, I don't know what I would have done!  Such a little product, and so important!!!",positive
The Inflatable buzz lightyear costume jet pack did arrived on time.  My son did like it but it did not last long. It was OK gift for my son.,positive
"Very fast shipping!Inflates easily and stayed inflated well.The elastic harness Velcros, so it's safe and it's gives a small 1/4"" adjust-ability to their size.They do stick out quite a bit from the sides of the child, but I think it adds to the excitement for the child.a lot of fun, The material is the same as that as a blow-up pool, so there is some durability, but seriously you have to expect that it can easily be punctured just the same if you are not careful.",positive
"This jet pack is easy to inflate, and my son can put it on himself. I like that it's inflatable, so my son can wear it as long as he wants, and then when it's time to take off, I can just deflate it, fold it up, and put it in my purse. The only problem we've encountered is that it rides up pretty high on my son's back, above his shoulders, so he keeps pulling it down lower, but it won't stay. It's pretty durable for an inflatable. My son crashes into things, the dog has stepped on it, but it still works.",positive
"plastic is a little fragile, but it will probably last as long as his attention, my grandson just loved it",positive
"This is a blow up wings. The strings to wear them are very small for my 3 year old, so I don't know how someone bigger could use them.  Ours has already got a hole in it.  It's cute, and big, but not very durable.",positive
"Ordered this as an accessory to the Buzz Lightyear costume my Son wanted to wear for Halloween. Was easy to inflate and put on. However, there is a pretty heavy chemical smell that comes off the item - not sure if it's from the materials it's made with or from the coloring on the jet pack. Rating would have been 5 stars if not for the smell.",positive
"I ordered the jet pack for my 6 year old grandson for Halloween 2011 to go with his Buzz Lightyear costume.  Unfortunately, when we blew up the jet pack the day before Halloween and my grandson wore it for about an hour, it began to deflate quickly.  We found a hole but were unable to patch it up so that it stayed inflated since the break was in a crease in the plastic material.  Luckily, I was able to find and purchase another jet pack at a nearby store in my city which held up fine on Halloween.",positive
"These were great for my son's halloween costume.  Looks fantastic.  They are inflatable - I don't know if you can tell that from the picture.  You have to get them really inflated in order for the wings to stick out straight like they should.  My chief complaint is how the straps (very thin 1/4&#34; elastic) are attached to the jet pack.  It looks like they will break loose any moment.  Mine survived a halloween party and halloween itself, but I don't expect this to stand up to much more.  It did look great with the costume, though!!!",positive
"We bought these wings to go with the Buzz Lightyear deluxe costume, and it really made the costume whole! They are inflatable so some care is needed but we have had them for a year and a half now and my son still uses them for &#34;super hero&#34; play time. Great buy, would recommend to anyone buying the deluxe costume for a great and i believe necessary add on.",positive
"My boys are very much into the superhero stage, and these were perfect!!  They are inflatable back pieces, with white elastic straps similar to a backpack style.  The great thing is no one gets injured from being whacked with the wings of these mid-flight.  (as one who got smacked in the face while my Buzz was off to save the galaxy, I can vouch for that).  Price was great, these are super fun!",positive
"I'm an adult so obviously it was a bit small but it was good for a costume. Not the best quality if you want something durable. It is still in one piece though, after a party.",positive
"I purchased my Suunto in 2005 (not from Amazon) and wore it daily from then until 2013. It has good to combat twice, multiple airborne jumps, and EVERYTHING! I had to replace the band once during this time (loctite my friends, loctite) and the battery just a few times. I am going back to Afghanistan in a few months and considered getting another Suunto, the Core, however, the reviews seemed pretty bad so I decided to get a new battery and keep the Vector. When I was stationed with the Special Forces, this watch was an issued time piece, and EVERYONE got one who was deploying to Afghanistan back then. I wasn't deploying at that time, so I purchased mine since everyone else had one. The face is large (52mm) and a majority of the painted numbers have rubbed off, however, the watch has never failed me. I seldom use the Compass or other functions, but when I did, they where dead on. Actually, one time flying on a mission I compared my ATLI reading with the planes instruments and it was dead on. Also, when I used the Compass for radio antenna set up, it was dead on as well. Actually, when doing land navigation testing, these watches aren't allowed because you have an advantage. In all, I have considered getting other Sports watches but this one has yet to let me down. When it does, I will stick with the Suunto Vector due to the lackluster reviews of the Suunto Core. The price has gone up since 2005, in which I paid $150.00 via an eBay sale, those days are apparently long gone. I've gone swiming, and even light diving and had no issues. The alarm works well, and the computer does all the fuzzy math so you don't have to worry about shorter months, leap years, blah blah blah. A solid product. If you know someone who is in the military have them purchase it for you because they are cheaper on military bases.My only advice would be to get some loctite to reinforce the screws. You can take it to a locale jewler and they can perform this service for you, likely for free.",positive
"I don't know how many vector series watches I have bought. It is the basic Suunto model but it has everything that I need, not only for everyday use but for my job in the military.",positive
"This may be the 'outdoorsy' ubergeek watch. It's big, it's ugly, but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy. Overall, I like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are.The timepiece: Outstanding. It has HH:MM:SS DD:MMM, of course, with a year setting to avoid leap year issues. This should go without saying in a modern digital watch. Stopwatch with lap function (not that I ever use the lap function, but I'm sure someone is interested). Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown (very easy to set). Three daily alarms. Special kudos for the alarms, this is one of the loudest watch alarms I've heard, and I've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this.The Altimeter: largely eye candy, but kind of neat. Over four days, my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level (by the maps, about 40m ASL). Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer, and I never recalibrated it, but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it.The Barometer: Yup, it's a barometer. The part I like is the little display that shows the rising/falling trend, especially as this is always active (even in normal 'time' mode).The Thermometer: Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist.The compass: Easily the best 'special' feature. Accurate, precise (enough for orienteering, not for surveying), easy to use. It can be programmed for a declination, but knowing me, I'd forget to reset it, so I do declination the hard way. The sighting notches are small but servicable. The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto, and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass. An outstanding wrist compass.The package: Big. Really, really big. But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing (a problem for me with other watches). The battery has a shortish (12-18 month) life, but has a hatch, so you don't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance. The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground, and the display light is just right, readible, even, and glare free, but not an emergency flashlight. Personally, I'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap, but the stock strap isn't bad, just not great.Overall, not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch, compass and barometer, and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter. Well designed, thought-out, and manufactured, but really big.",positive
"It does everything I need a watch to do and it looks good too.  I have several of these watches in different colors, and since the battery is so easy to change I do it myself. which saves money.",positive
"To my way of thinking, there are only TWO factors which keep the Vector from receiving a full 5-stars here.  #1 is the watch face.  It is not very durable.  It isn't even glass.  It's made out of VERY easily scratched plastic.  I own several watches, and even the plain glass face models scratch at the drop of a hat, but this one takes it to a whole new level.  I'd be worried to sneeze too close for fear it may implode.#2 is the fact that despite the promises of being water resistent to 100 Meters (ie 300 feet) this watch isn't...FAR from it.  You are in danger of ruining this watch if you even enter a bathroom while someone ELSE is taking a hot shower.  The humidity alone may cause problems.  Pretty sad when a watch advertised as at the very least capable in a pool cannot honestly pull off a basic shower in a bathtub.Now, with that said, if you take care to avoid moisture whenever you can, the Vector is a fine wrist computer that works quite well in a variety of areas.  It'll tell you the temperature (under the right circumstances, of course), help you predict the weather, give you a bearing on where you need to go and then (after proper adjusting) tell you your altitude.  I found the altimeter to actually be rather accurate -- oh, and those reviews I have read on-and-off by folks bragging about telling the altitude INSIDE of a pressurized passenger plane are BOGUS.Considering what this watch can do, and it's limitations, I believe that the price is a bit high (you can buy a Casio watch that'll do the same thing--and is solar-powered, AND is REALLY water-resistent, all for LESS) but the Vector has one thing that not all Suunto watches, or altimeter/barometer/compass watches come with: that little bubble on the face which allows a more accurate determination of specific readings.  If Casio add's one to their model, I'll probably become a full-time convert.  If you are looking for something similar, but smaller, try looking at the Suunto Observer.  It's a dang-good-looking watch, but the price is considerably more, so that may be a rather important factor for you (I know it is for me).All in all, Suunto makes great products, but water resistent models are unfortunately NOT one of them (unless you are going for one of their products that actually are designed for underwater use).",positive
"Purchased at Bagram Afghanistan PX in 2007 and this watch is a must-have for anyone treking into the mountains (of which I did, alot).  Over the years the watch has taken a beating - the bezel is scratched up but, I still get a lot of comments about the watch.  The altimeter (incl the memory function) worked very well.  Battery replacement is easy (and has to occur about once a year).  The watch is a typical ABC watch, that looks good and does the job.",positive
Amazing watch which I use on a daily basis. The time is large and is easily read and the date is just below that which is very useful in my job. The altimeter and barometer work great once they are calibrated correctly. Easy to use watch with three alarms that can be set quickly. The watch fits well and is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.,positive
"I've bought this one and works perfectly, but I've changed it for a X-Lander with Aluminium case, wich one is perfect.",positive
"I expected a lot more from a &#34;wrist computer&#34; selling for almost 250.00, and the Military version for $300. First of all the visibility of the display is much too dark.  The images of the X-Lander on the Amazon and Suunto websites have been enhanced to the point that a case could be made for false advertising.  Secondly, the instructions to set the numeric values (meters vs feet, etc.) aren't even covered in the instructions that come with the watch, you have to download the full set of instructions to figure that out, then some of the fields used to set the values are so small and located in such bizarre locations, that even with 20/20 vision, I had to use an illuminated magnifying glass to see, then set the values.  Thirdly, the backlight feature is useless in low light or bright daylight.  It is only good for pitch black darkness...much too dim, but is probably the same as their military version, which has to be at a low level to keep the wearer from getting shot!  Fourth, (probably for the same reason) the alarm is not loud enough, especially if you are wearing the X-Lander under a couple of layers of clothing.  As others have stated, it should not be counted upon as a means to wake you from sleep.  Fifth, the barometric trend indicator is totally unreadable...too small and too dim to see under normal circumstances unless you also happen to be carrying a small foldout magnifying glass (which, as it turns out, I do carry while trekking).  Finally, the feature navigation is not intuitive, meaning if you do not use the features and sub-features regularly, good luck with remembering how some of the functions are accessed, and turned on and off, unless you carry the instructions on your person.I am going to keep this &#34;wrist computer&#34; for trekking, but it will not be the watch on my wrist for everyday casual use.  That honor will still go to my Wenger Military.  Because of that, there should be a way to shut off the X-Lander (short of removing the battery) so the battery does not run down while it's in the safe...still hoping to find out how to do that...doesn't have a stem to pull out like a watch.I can not recommend the X-Lander.  It is feature-rich, fairly compact and lightweight,  but the issues above make it less than desirable and overpriced.  The Finns need to address these issues before I buy another Suunto &#34;wrist computer&#34;.",positive
"I've had this watch for several years now and it still holds up. It is a little pricier than some of the competition from Casio and Timex. However, it offers some nice advantages over most others, with only a couple drawbacks. I wore mine for two tours in Iraq and it performed perfectly. Not that I truly ever relied on the Comp-Baro-Alti features, because we always had other more advanced devices for that. But it was reassuring to have those capabilities on my wrist at all times. And the basic time, stopwatch, alarm and timer functions were used often and performed well.Pros:User replaceable battery - very helpful in the field and easy to do, saves money.Broad array of functions - easy to manipulate the various features with a little practice and reading the manual.Very accurate - the watch loses very little time over the months and years, good quartz movement.Good water resistance - not a dive watch, but it holds up well, even under several meters of water, which I've done.Comfortable despite its large size - pretty light weight and a large, comfortable band.Easy to read - large face, big numbers.Attractive design - very distinct look.Cons:Not solar-atomic (like Casio Pathfinder) - however, battery is easily replaced and the quartz movement is very accurate.Thicker case - more so than the Casio PAW1300, but not too bad.Bottonology - the button function layout is different than most Timex and Casios, but isn't too hard to figure out.Price - higher than many, but not excessive for what you get.Overall, despite the drawbacks referenced above, I highly recommend the Suunto X-Lander and I would assume the other Suunto models are also good. Serves me well.",positive
"I collect watches, and I am NOT one to shy away from big watches, and in some cases, the bigger the better.  What I really love about the X-Lander is that it is big but also very light-weight.  Normally when you see a wrist watch this large you have to exercise your arm quite a bit just to get used to telling time, but not so with the X-Lander.  And best of all: it does WAY MORE than just tell time!Interested in knowing where you are going?  How about the current temperature?  Are you just the slightest bit interested in what your current altitude may be?  GO BUY THIS WATCH!  'Course for those Suunto enthusiasts, this ISN'T a watch, its a Wristop Computer that just so happens to be able to tell time.  Unlike the Suunto Observer which is about half the size (and more than a little extra spendy), this baby will do all that and still look great doing it.  From the 3 different Suunto models I personally own, I must admit that they make a great wristop computer, or for the picky out there, watch.  I mostly use mine to tell simple time, but I must say that as I drive over the mountains up to Montana or over to Oregon and Washington, it IS handy to know a few extra details just by looking down at my wrist.  Oh, I almost forgot the barometer!  It tracks the barometric pressure and helps you track and even predict the weather!  I must say that I haven't been able to figure out the finer points of how to do that just yet, but I AM working on it.I guess if I HAD to point out one flaw, I would say that the night-glo feature it comes with isn't all that bright, and the alarm could stand to be louder -- but it IS about 5 TIMES more audible than the absolutely embarassing alarm built into the Observer.  Other than these minor complaints, I whole-heartedly endorse pretty much everything manufactured by Suunto, and especially the models I own, the X6HR, The Observer and of course the X-Lander.  Sylish, multi-functional and quite durable.  Choose one of these models and you will no doubt be as satisfied as I am.",positive
"GREAT!!! Service, I got excately what I ordered and received it in 4 days!  I recommend'em and will to my friends and family as well..",positive
"This watch screams high-tech, and anyone venturing off to a comic book convention is bound to get a few nods from people dressed in Sith Lord garb and even a wicked witch or two.So it's big, real big, but cool.  If you want a little more discreet, go with the Observer.The new synthetic band that has replaced the leather is a real improvement.  After all, whoever heard of a sports watch with a leather band?  The idea is absolutely absurd.  HOWEVER, the back eyelit got chafed and worn away the first two weeks.  Of course, it doesn't show, but it's annoying, especially considering this isn't an el cheapo watch.If you're into mountain biking, running, swimming, hiking, or training of any sort, this is the watch for you.  It doesn't have super sports specific functionality, but in my experience I've never used stuff like that in any case, so this watch accomodates me perfectly.And women DROOL over it.  Well, sorta.",positive
This was for my grandson for Halloween and he loved it.  He is a huge spider man fan.  He look great in it.,positive
"I ordered this for my son, who was invited to a Superhearo party.  He has been in a solid size 6 and sometimes goes up to a 7.  I think this costume runs a bit small.  It fit him perfectly but if he wore a 7, I think it would be too tight.The costume is of average durability. Parents used to ordering these types of costumes will find it average.  If I had to wash this every week, it might not make it past 6 months.I didn't order any gloves to go with this, he wanted them but didn't need them.  Unless it's a chilly Halloween night, save your $ and skip the gloves as well.Overall my son loves this costume. He's not a fan of the velcroe back. it bothers him, so we leave the back open, he's usually wearing a shirt underneath anyway.We were going to a party in the spring. The costume is quite warm. The material is thin but the overall effect left him overheated in the sun.  Please keep this in mind if you're using the costume in a warmer climate.It is a good value for the price.",positive
"Yelp, I guarantee this costume will rip on the 1st day of play.  It is really cheaply made.  It's the same cheap costumes that you find in walmart for 7-10 bucks.  And I had to cut out a nose and mouth it doesn't give them a place to breath out of .  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR so don't pay over 10 bucks for this temporary costume",positive
this is a great costume. size is true. i ordered it with the matching gloves. great gift for little boys who love spiderman,positive
It was a big hit with my 4 yr. old. He loved it.  It fits perfectly with room for growing.  The price was really good too.,positive
"Good lock, I use this for my gym locker and it serves it's purpose. I like that the color stands out so i don't have a hard time finding my locker(:",positive
"Yes, this is a good lock especially for the money.  But I had to laugh when I realized I could not enter my own combination numbers.....the maker actually gives you the combination you have to use on your lock and then you get to memorize THEIR numbers.....how stupid are we getting??",positive
This lock does the job when I go to the gym. It feels pretty cheap though. They dont make them like they used too.I am more concerned with not unlocking vs someone breaking it.,positive
"Always a smooth, easy to use lock.  Great for lockers and standard uses.  I wouldn't put it on my bike, too easy to cut, but for lockers at school, the gym.  Great lock.",positive
"For the price, I think this is a fine costume. No more cheaply made than the next Halloween costume but because it's so simple, you can't really tell. It was a hit at the party I attended (I went with someone dressed in a priest costume made by the same company - great couples' idea)! It would earn an extra star if it came with the cross. I had to buy one for another ten bucks at the last minute.",positive
I have a friend and she is not dating for  a few years untill her child goes to college.She said I feel like Im a nun now so I sent this to her. She laughed her ass off.,positive
Happy with it.  Good value for the money an would recommend it to someone who is looking to purchase one.,positive
"This came fast and it's of great quality! Perfect for the price, a little better actually. I am going to enjoy this ;)Happy Halloween!",positive
"I love this. It was cheap, and it is super cute and the kids just adore it. Anything to do with Dora is always a hit, and they felt like it was similar to her backpack...",positive
"Great for  a toddler, perfect size for the little ones. Durable and no chocking worries at all. Enough in the purse to role play and hold interest great price too!",positive
"I bought this for my 2 year old cousin. She has a habit of taking her mothers purse and walking all over with it so I figured it would be perfect. When I first saw it I fell in love with the soft material and girly colors and she absolutely loves it. She always remembers to put her things in her purse so she can be ""just like mommy.""",positive
This purse is very cute and my 15 month old g-daughter loves it.  It's her favorite purse of the two she has.,positive
I bought this for little 2 year old for Christmas & she loved it.  The price was fair too!!! I will probably buy from this company again.,positive
This is a fun little purse for a toddler. It's a manageable size and comes with fun things inside. Just wish the steps were a bit longer.,positive
i love it its cute my daughter plays with it she feels like a little lady with it . .,positive
"my 2 year old daughter loves this product! she is not crazy about the purse which is pretty small but she really likes the things that come with it. I wish the phone would have been made to work with batteries, so it would make a noise or something but it is just a piece of plastic with fake buttons.",positive
"My 15 month old daughter received this for Christmas and she loves it.  I wish the phone buttons could be pushed or did something.  Other than that, it is a fun toy and she walks around the house carrying her handbag just like mommy.  Too cute!",positive
I purchased this purse for my daughter who is almost 2.  She loves playing with all the parts and I gave her some additional cards to put in the purse.  Better than some of the other sets I found online.,positive
"My 20-month old granddaughter loves to go through Mommy's purse so I was sure she would love this one - but not so.  The phone doesn't do anything and doesn't look mom's smart phone, the mirror is tiny, the credit card wallet is hard too open. Mostly, the things just aren't 'real' enough to match what Mom has. It was tossed in a corner after the first day and hasn't been used since.",positive
"&#34;What is thaaaat?!?&#34; That was the shriek exclaimed by my 2.5 y/o when she opened this up on Christmas! She is so super excited about this purse set... She loves the credit card, phone and &#34;Chapstick (lipstick)&#34; the most. The size of the enclosed items are. Perfect for a toddler. The price was really good, too. We are definitely very happy with this purchase. Oh, for those who may care, the mirror that came with her set was yellow vs the shown blue, just FYI.",positive
I haven't opened it yet but it looks really cute.fast delivery also!cant wait to give it as a gift to my 2 year old shes going to love it!,positive
"I bought this for my friend's three year old daughter and she absolutely adored it. It's been about a month since then and my friend said her daughter still can't leave the house without it! For the money, this gift is perfect!",positive
"very nice first purse for a little girl. My granddaughter will love it, I am saving it to give to her for Easter.",positive
"My kids liked this and have fun playing around with it, the only thing I felt was the price could have been better. Saw it much cheaper at Walmart not too long ago and then believe it or not at the dollar store.However, the product itself is durable and nice, not kids hazards jumping right out or frail designs.",positive
"This is adorable.  The fabric of the purse is nice and soft and the little items inside are cute.  I like the size of it as well.  Not too large, not too small.  My granddaughter will love it.",positive
"The child I gave it to loved it, she carries it around all the time.  Cool toy for the Mommy mini me girly girl.",positive
"This is pretty cute for the price.  A bit cheaper in quality than the small picture makes it look, but for the price, it serves it's purpose.  My 2 year old niece loves it!",positive
"My daughter wanted a toy cell phone, (911 dispatchers probably wouldn't agree its a good toy, but oh well) so I got to looking and I got this set for just a little more than just a phone would have cost.  She loves all of it and carries it around the house, she just turned 4.  Great product for the price, I would recommend it.",positive
Bought for my 15 month old Granddaughter. She thinks it's great. I think her favorite piece is the fake lipstick. It's worth buying.,positive
"I haven't actually gotten to see the product, but I got a call from my sister-in-law and she told me how much her daughter loves her first purse.  She said she carried it quite often and that it was a perfect gift for a 3 or 4 year old girl!",positive
My neice loves it. She really likes the cell phone.  She is so cute with her little purse! She loves the little mirror in it.,positive
My granddaughter loves it & all the adorable goodies inside it.She carries it everywhere with her and happily plays with the accessories.,positive
I bought this when I saw it on Amazon. I also bought a book (Lillie's Purple Plastic Purse) to go along with it as a gift for my 2 year old niece. Lots of fun for a little girl.,positive
"I sent this to my granddaughter for Christmas and never heard back or got a thank you or even if my granddaugter received it. I am only guessing that it was all that it was suppose to be. Since I had it sent to myself and I wrapped and sent it to them myself I did get a look at it from outside the box. It looked pretty good quality to me and I would have bought it for my daughter when she was little if they had it then, I would still recommend it as a nice gift as it came in a very sturdy box and everything looked like fun to me.",positive
"My daughter had one of these when she was a toddler. It was really sweet and she loved carrying it around and taking the stuff out. I ended up buying one for my step-grandaughter this Christmas. She was thrilled with it and just like my daughter used to do, she had a blast pulling everything out, going through it and putting it all back in. Everything is easy to hold, fun to look at, and just grown-up enough to make them feel like this really is their own purse.",positive
My daughter was in love w/this for about 5 mins (she's 2)...then she threw everything all over the place & never looked at it again.  Maybe I'll put it away & regift it to her next year.,positive
I got this for my 17month granddaughter. She enjoys the toy. She really likes the phone and lip stick. I think she will enjoy even more as time goes on.,positive
I was in a hurry and needed an easy little gift for a one year old's birthday. It does say on the tag that it is for 2+ but the pieces inside weren't too terribly small. It came in the mail quick with prime so generally I'm happy and so was the kid. Win win!,positive
My twin cousins loved this! They are not yet two but said &#34;ohhhh&#34; and sighed like they were so elated :),positive
"This was so much fun for my niece, a two year old.  She liked the items so she could be &#34;just like mommy&#34;. She loved the purse for other items as well, like carrying her other precious things.  Nice little toy gets a lot of use.",positive
"This is a great little purse, and my daughter still plays with it a year later. The design is very cute, but the phone could be better (like if numbers could actually be pressed and perhaps sounds made). When you put all the accessories in the bag, it is pretty full and barely closing. But my daughter has since found a better phone to put in her purse, along with the rest.",positive
".....this was purchased for my daughter for her first birthday.  It's very cute, and I can see her playing with it a bit more as she gets older.  Right now she's more into the ""take the stuff out of the purse and put it back in"" stage, but still......a neat little toy for the lil miss in your life!",positive
"It's very durable, perfect for your &#34;little princess&#34;.  Now my 2 year old princess is using it, and loves it, now she has her bag /phone and make-up too!  So cute!",positive
"We bought this for our 15-mo old granddaughter. She liked carrying it around.  She played with the ""Phone"" and the ""keys"" that came with it and ""used"" the lipstick.  I liked that the handle was soft and the purse was a good size for toddlers.  I'm sure she will continue to enjoy it over the next few years.",positive
"My oldest daughter, who is now 5 years old, got one of these purses a couple of years ago from my mother.  Out of all of the toys that my daughters have, this is the one that they would fight over the most, so for my youngest daughter's 3rd birthday I got her her very own ""First Purse"".  They both love playing with all of the included accessories, and often throw in a few additional items of their own.  The purses and accessories are all very durable, in fact, I had to put my daughters' initials on everything because I really can't tell the difference between the new items, and the items that we've had for a couple of years already.  Out of all of the little purses that I've looked at online and everywhere else, I definitely feel like this is the cutest and best deal out there.",positive
bought this for our daughters 2nd birthday and she loves it. its great for any little girls &#34;first purse&#34; :),positive
"I gave this as a gift for the daughter of a friend. I was not able to check the age requirement but it turns out, the gift was still a hit, especially the cellphone. This is a good buy.",positive
My daughter is 1 and loves to play with this purse. She takes the items out and outs them back in. She also tries to talk on the phone and thinks the debit card is fun to carry around.,positive
SHE ESPECIALLY LOVED THE LIPSTICK & PASSED IT AROUND THE TABLE.  IT WA SO CUTE WATCHING HER JOY FINDING ALL THAT WAS IN THE PURSE.  GOOD BUY GRANDMA,positive
I got this for my two year old granddaughter...she loved it...it is safe and the different objects in the purse are very appealing.,positive
I bought this for a gift for the neighbor and it was perfect - she was turning 2 and was just starting to get into her mom's purse.,positive
My first purse is very sturdy and nice for any little girl developing into a big girl. I love it.,positive
"Bought this for a baby in the family, she loves real purses so I had to buy her the baby version! she loved it.",positive
"Great watch, extremely light, nice sinister metal color. I'd rate it as more than acceptable for dress wear.  My friends are green eyed envious and want one.  My only question is why doesn't the secondhand click evenly on the numerals on the watch face?  I can't believe that one reviewer was upset that the watch crystal wasn't as bullet proof as the titanium watch case and band.",positive
"I've owned two of these watches now.  It is by far the best watch I've ever had.  It is so light you don't feel it on.  It's great if you are a cyclist and want to reduce every once of weight on your bike. Quite literally, it is about 1/3 the weight of an average steel band watch. It has a sleek profile compared to most steel band watches so rarely gets snagged on things while doing work.  The face is also smaller than most  comparable watches.  About 1/2 way between a normal man's size watch and a womans watch.  I personally like the color of titanium over stainless steel and have received compliments on this watch for that reason.  It is fairly scratch resistant.  I am very abusive with my watches.  I wear them 24 hours a day even while working or in water.  I do a lot of hands on woodwork etc.  I've drug the face across some sharp metal stuff and this has put some light scratches on the face.  Under normal use I suspect it would not get too scratched up.  The band rarely comes unlatched even if you do happen to snag it on something.  The pins have never bent or come out, ever!  I think the titanium latch has better wear over stainless steel watch bands. The pins are probably also made of titanium.  It don't know for certain but given the fact they've never come out I assume so.  Titanium is much stronger than steel.  The band itself is very smooth and comfortable.  It never pinches the skin or feels irritating.  The reason why I have had 2 now instead of one is that I crashed on my road bike during a 30+ mph sprint and it was drug across 10 feet or more of pavement after an initial hard impact.  That broke the face of the watch and put some deep scratches into the titanium but the band never broke or came off.  The hands were still good.  If I remember correctly I think the watch was still working after all that until I started messing with the hands on it.  I paid $100 for it both times.  Now that I see they are a lot less on Amazon I think I'll buy another so if I eventually lose or break this one in maybe 10 years from now I'll have another to replace it.  You will not be disappointed if you buy this watch. You will seriously be saving money because it is nearly indestructible and you won't lose it if you never take it off because the band doesn't ever break or come off the watch.",positive
Son's had his for 3-4 years. My 18 yr old son liked his so much. He even got compliments on it. Just bought another as a gift. It arrived in a frosted plastic display cube - looks nice. Good price for this watch.,positive
"Wow!  I paid $67 for this exact watch on Amazon just a few weeks ago! I was shocked to see that the current price is $112.50.  It's a great watch at $67, not quite as good at the higher price - note that CostCo sells them for $69.95.  The links are truly a bear to remove.  I suspect that the link removal device sold on Amazon may not work due to the particular design of these links.  You have to push the linking device out from inside the band rather than from the outside edge of the band.",positive
"I wish I had the camera out when our little girl first saw her Backpack. Her face lit up. She was so excited. She also loved 'Map'. Our girl is a small 1yr 9months, so the straps are a little big. Aside from it being a little too big on her back, Backpack keeps our girl entertained. She really likes putting things into it. I'd highly recommend this for every little Dora fan.",positive
"The bag is great. The map seems to be a little cheap. It's connected to a small piece of rope. The map is hard for my 3 year old to roll up & Velcro back together.. Otherwise, the bag is sturdy.",positive
"Bought this backpack for my daughter to carry her Dora books in and it fits.  But the weight of the 2 books made the magnet snap pop off constantly.  I think it would be fine if you don't put anything inside the backpack, but if you want to put books in there like my daughter, then you would have to sew on your own snap or button.  Cute!",positive
"Nice quality,my daughter loves it to wear to her preschool! She has it on her back all the time!I don't want her to outgrow this any soon!!The quality & finish is great!highly recommend!!",positive
"The kids just love this. Why---no clue. I ordered it because my friend asked me to order it for her daughter, so I ordered 2---one for my daughter as well. We live in the caribbean, where it's hot, so a thick plush backpack is something you don't want to have on your back. The color is cute too, but I can see it easily getting soiled. I didn't let this backpack out of the house, and ended up giving it to another child.I liked the pull-out map feature that comes attached to it though. The flap stays closed with a magnetic closure. Good size.",positive
"I needed an everyday digital watch that I can wear to classes and gym. This one does the job very well at its kind price (can find at a cheaper price online) and looks good as well. It stays very comfortable on my wrist due to its thin and small face. I have a relatively thin wrist (Sz 6.5) so it looks proportional. I can see how this one can look a little small if you have a thick wrist but worth a try anyway. It even looked a little small on my wrist at first but I became to like the look of it as time passed.I also just switched battery on mine since the lcd looked a little weak. It's extremely easy to change the battery too. Just unscrew the 4 bolts on the back, take out the watch inside (it's one piece), open it by opening four corners, swap the battery, then put it back together. Even if you have no experience with battery changing on a watch, you will figure out easily.Overall, I'm very satisfied.The only con if I have to pick one - the light could be a little brighter. But no problem reading the time.",positive
"The buttons aren't overly sensitive (problem with my old watch), good fit, easy to use. I highly suggest to anyone.",positive
"These watches go forever. If you do not use the light or stopwatch, the battery can last for years. The band is the only thing that has ever broken on mine and a band cost almost as much as the watchYou can wash your hands or get caught in the rain and not worry about the watch since it is water resistant",positive
"Got it for my bf and he likes it.  The lap feature in particular is nice.  Other than that it's just a good, basic watch.  The watch face was a little smaller than I expected, but nothing wrong with that.",positive
Love it.it's a bit edgy and bothering at first but soon its very comfortable.does it job.Considering buying? You should.,positive
"I need a watch to carry in my pocket, most pocket watches are too large, but by removing the strap and ancillary parst from this watch it does the job very well; to only negative is the instructions that come in teeny-tiny print requiring a magnifying glass which is very irritating",positive
"I wanted a watch to wear when working in the yard, this fits the need.  I had to go on line to find out how to change the time, but that was easy.",positive
"I have had many big fancy watches and have settled on the Casio F-91W Casual Sport Watch.It's light, cheap, super accurate, and easy, intuitive to operate.  You don't need a manual to  set time or alarm.  No need for those big clunky heavy watches to bang around.  Those timepieces are just silly.",positive
"Worked for a while.  Then it broke.  Or maybe I lost it.  But for 10 bucks who cares.  This is the kind of watch you get before a trip where you don't want to risk losing, breaking or having stolen your real watch.  Might also work as a kid's first watch but it might not hold up to kid-level abuse.  It's cheap (in cost) because it's a cheap watch.  So there you go.",positive
It works well and gets the job done. I have a small wrist and it fits like a glove. I love the stopwatch (although I keep forgetting it. Completely recommend!,positive
"I wear my high-top chucks until they have holes everywhere so I know my size and style.  These were cheaper than the chucks on the converse website so I took a chance and am happy that I did.  They are the same ones I get every time, perfect size, perfect fit.  They are just as comfy as always, needing only one double-socked wear to break them in.  I love them. &#9829;",positive
"I got these for my daughter because I favor black Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star high-tops myself when I wear sneakers, and she likes to clomp around in them, so I thought I'd get her her own pair. Once she found out they come in pink, no other color would do.  Sigh.  But they are SUPER cute, and the lacing up the ankles means they fit tight and won't come off, but lots of room to grow through the toes.  One drawback, the laces are hard for a toddler to manage, and she has extreme difficulty getting them off by herself.",positive
So wonderfull I liked a lot and I will purchase it whenever I will need it and I received alot of comment of it.,positive
"My daughter had me order the for her for her first year in high school. They arrived as expected, fit perfectly, and she's happy. It doesn't get much better than this!",positive
This is a great high quality pair of shoes. The canvas is high quality and the stitching looks good. The inside of the shoes are also great. Buy chucks here for $20 ish less than at other places. Also make sure to buy a half or a full size smaller than what you normally wear. If you get these in the correct size you won't be dissapointed! If you found this review helpful please make sure to hit the helpful button to help others see this too. Thanks!,positive
"It's not bad, but it's kind of cheap leather and doesn't seem to wear very well. I've worn them for a year or so and they still squeak and feel pretty cheap. They're a little bit large, coming from someone that has had many, many pairs of Converse.",positive
"I gave this snikers to my 15 year-old son and he loved. It has a juvenile color and it can use it daily, are confortables, the color is durable. Their friends have liked it. I recommend it",positive
"Bought for my granddaughter, they are too cute. cant wait to see her to give them to her. They are really cute and the color is perfect",positive
"I work with a friend who is the biggest Chuck Taylor fan of all time.  She has who knows how many pairs of Chucks (over 20), and always seems to wear a different color every day.  So to be a good friend, I had to get a pair.  Red, being one of my favorite colors, seemed the right choice.  I bought size 6.5 Men's, which translates to 8.5 Women's.  The fit is good!  These are heavier than I would have expected, but they aren't uncomfortably so.  They are very sturdy considering so much of them is made from canvas.  My feet feel well supported.  While I probably won't go bonkers over them, I might have to invest in a second pair.",positive
"They say that ""it takes a real man to wear pink"", but even among women and girls who wear Converse, pink is an uncommon color. These make quite a statement no matter what crowd you run with. In some ways it can even be a safety measure, as they make you easy to identify in a multitide. Because they are so unique, people that wouldn't normally remember or even pay you a second glance will tend to look twice and/or learn to recognize you - I think that alone makes these worth the money compared to any other shoe.In addition, unlike many shoes, Converse don't mind being thrown in the washing machine for occasional cleaning (just avoid the bleach, or you'll fade them quite fast). Thus, I don't mind wearing these everywhere, because if they get dirty it's no big deal.Speaking of fading, pink Converse have to be worn for awhile before they resemble the color of the image shown - they are a bit more bright, deep pink than they appear. They are not ""neon pink"" (a separate and easily distinguished color), but nonetheless pinker than the image.Converse almost invariably seem to run a half size larger, and these are no exception. So if you're a 9.5, get a 9, etc. These were my very first pair, and I'm glad that I tried them on in a store to learn this before ordering - it would have been a rather unpleasant surprise.Also true to most Converse, these have little to no arch support, a thinner sole compared to most modern shoes (i.e. you'll feel it if you step on a rock or such), and don't take too kindly to being worn in the rain, mud, snow, etc. I certainly wouldn't run a mile or take a hike in them. For those reasons, I've got to knock one star, as much as I otherwise love these shoes.",positive
I bought these for my daughter and she absolutely loved them . They are very comfortable and help to support her ankles when she goes walking . great price was helpful in purchase . recommend this product .,positive
"what can i say stylish and comfortable black goes with everything,my husband has many pairs in assorted colors he likes the so much",positive
"I purchased these for my daughter's hip hop dance competition routine. Pricey but very good quality. All white. These are stated in men's sizes so be sure to convert to women's. For example, men's 3 is women's 5. There is a chart listed either by seller or on Converse website for reference. These worked out well and hopefully get to use next year for the competition routine so we can get return on our investment. $70!",positive
"These are RADICAL! These are really hot with black jeans . Buy one size smaller than you normally buy shoes, these run large.",positive
"The title says it all. I loved these, but you literally have to wrestle your kid and near mangle his feet, even when a size or two too big- to get them on. THEN you have to lace and tie them! On a kicking toddler! Yeah, right! IMPOSSIBLE to get on for the most part. And don't seem comfortable either. they need to create this same shoe, but but an easy access ZIPPER on the side, down to the toe bed to get the young child's foot inside.",positive
"Simple, comfortable and lightweight shoes. Dense fabric. Good quality rubber, soft sole. I hope that will be pleasantly worn.Delivered in a timely manner. I'm quite happy.",positive
"Love my converse! I remember them from high school, and they also ran a half size too big back in the day.  Once you get the right size, they're great.  I wear a 8 (womens) and ordered a 5.5 in Men's.",positive
"I'm a major Converse fan, I like to collect them in all different colors, why not pink? I already knew my Converse size from the other Chuck Taylor colors I already owned, so sizing wasn't an issue at all, even though most of my other Converse are low-cut Oxfords. The high-tops can take a little more work to get onto your feet, but it's worth it I think for the high-top style. And the pink is a nice subdued shade, not a gaudy hot pink or anything like that. Definitely recommended for both women and men who are secure enough in themselves to go out and about wearing pink Converse. They look great.",positive
I bought these exclusively to be worn for my daughter's Mavis Halloween Costume and they were perfect!! She was comfy for a few hours of trick-or-treating with no issues of sore feet:),positive
"Man let me tell you, I always wanted a pair of these but I was being cheap and didnt want to spend the money...But as you can see I broke down and went for it.  I searched and searched and I am so glad for Amazon's buyers writing reviews because this is what made me go for it.  I read most all of the reviews to make my determination of size because I made a mistake before because I didn't know to order a size smaller.  If you a female and are buying a pair of Converse you better get a size smaller if the listings say Converse Men.  I Love, Love, Love these dang shoes and I love the fact that now that I know what size to order.  The fit is perfect.",positive
Always wanted a Converse but was somewhat indecisive. Now I regret not getting one of these sooner. Awesome! A very good decision.,positive
"All star is my favorite brand of tennis because thier durability, thanks for sending it just on time, Im very thankful.",positive
"Well made, wider cut than adult version to fit blocky toddler feet and chubby ankles.  Completes that old school hip hop everyone wants for their kid.",positive
"This was exactly what I was looking for. If you are shopping for this item, you will not be disappointed.Item arrived within 2 days.",positive
i had some converse and long story short i drew on them and they got messed up so i got a new pare and these are perfect. fit good. and these are mens. ok so these shoes say mens five but really they are a womens 7 i think or 7 and a half! so just go on google and search what your size is in mens and you can get the mens ones too. they are exactly the same as the womens so ya! i hope this helped,positive
I bought these for my nephew's birthday and they were exactly what he wanted.  They arrived in the right amount of time and in perfect condition.  Would recommend this seller to anyone.,positive
ive always been a huge fan of converse but when i received these i was amazed at the quality and look. they fit perfectly and i will wear these so much!,positive
"I bought this product for my Boyfriend, and he loves it. Leather is better than plain cloth. Easy to make it white. Very neat and cool. Perfect with jeans. Casual, but looks clean.",positive
"Got these for my son, as he is a fan of Daniel Tiger, and I thought they could match.  He has had them for 6 months, and has worn them constantly - they are still in great shape, and he gets really good traction.  He climbs a lot and runs, and is very confident in these shoes. It appears he gets good support too, so he looks forward to wearing them.  Great product.",positive
Im glad I listened to the advice posted and got a slightly smaller size than usual. I normally were a size 12 and the 11.5 fit perfect !,positive
"We purchased these shoes for the girls in our bridal party as they were wearing Latte dresses. The boys wore black to match their suits. I wore white, and my husband black.The high-tops were a better choice so short socks could be worn by the ladies and the boys didn't have white socks peeking out under their pant legs' hems.All arrived quickly and in one large box.",positive
Excellent article.It was what I expected.Excellent Shoe and good service delivery.I am satisfied with the package.I recommend them.My daughter loves it.,positive
"My Doctor Who wannabe son asked for this shoes, and he is THRILLED with them. Fit well and look great with a red bow tie and fez.",positive
"Always in style, no matter what era! These converse shoes are the exact style I wore in the 80s and my dad wore in the 50s.  Now my daughter is wearing them today. They dont provide any kind of cushion or support, I am so surprised they were actually worn for basketball back in the day. Fashion and color choices make these shoes a forever classic.",positive
"Nice fit, looks like the picture. Delivered promptly, price was excellent. No issues at all would recommend to others. thanks",positive
I stand on my feet for 7 hours at a time in a professional job. This is my shoe w/ a walking insole inside I work it out just fine and no one notices I have on sneaks! I am on my fourth pair and looking for several replacements. Works great w/ slacks or khaki pants. (make sure if you are getting them as an alternative to a ladies dress shoe get the all blk w/ the all blk gumsole and all blk laces) Most dress shoes for ladies are very very uncomfortable even though they are fashionable and this one does both very well. The fact that I can machine wash makes them even more likeable.,positive
The ultimate rocker or groupie shoe.  So cool and never goes out of style.  Wear them with a tux or jeans or a mini-skirt.  You cannot go wrong with these shoes.  Great price.  In Europe they cost three times more!,positive
"Born in the mid 60's and going through the 70's, my mom would always buy me these. Still feels the same to.Every time I wear them, it really takes me back to those fabulous 70's.",positive
"They're classic converse - what is there to say!?  I've never had a pair, but they fit as I thought they would.  They're a little more narrow than I expected, but that's not really a problem.  They fit true to size... I originally got a slightly larger one, but sent it back for my true size.",positive
"Just your basic, hi top chucks. I have them in almost every color, and they are a good shoe when you need the ankle support.Will only give 5 stars if the item goes above and beyond expectations, which is why I only rated 4 stars. .",positive
these shoes are very cute and comfortable realmentes find them at a very affordable price more to give away this Christmas will be the perfect gift for my brother.,positive
"Maybe I should have exchanged them for a bigger size, but when I tried them on they fit fine.  They were perfect in the length so I thought the sizing was ok.  But after an hour my toes feel pinched and hurt. They look super cute but it is really hard to wear them for any period of time.  My feet are not wide by any means, so it was disappointing to have this issue.",positive
"I knew I had the best shoes when my then 10 year old cousin went nuts for my pink hi-tops a few years ago!And he was even more excited when I gave him the key to my SUV so he could see the new pair of limegreen ones I had just purchased.I think that I wore the pink ones while travelling in California a few years ago.  While we werehaving lunch in Santa Barbara one day, I noticed a store across the street and found some supportsthat allowed me to do even more walking while on that 2 week vacation.  I was in my late fiftiesat the time, and it was fun to see the expressions I got while wearing those shoes!!!  Since Imisplaced the old pink pair, I am now replacing them.  My favorite shoe of all time!!!Mary",positive
"Harkens back to my youth. I truly love these shoes! Fit perfect, get dirty throw them in the wash. Heck yeah!",positive
"These have been a staple in America for decades. They are sturdy canvas that wears extremely well over time. The soles are rubber and glued. After extreme wear, some parts that are glued can get loosened. Shoe goo can be used to make most if not all repairs on these. So they can last longer than nearly any shoe. They make them exactly like they did decades ago, with the same quality, with one caveat, Converse, the iconic American shoes, are now made in China. This may or may not matter to you. It does matter to me, due to labor practices, and environmental standards, which is why I typically buy New Balance shoes, still made in the USA as of 2013. I've worn made in USA converse in the past, but never the new China-made ones. On arrival I couldn't tell any difference in the shoe itself, just as sturdy as ever.On a side note: This particular style is pretty trendy among celebrities. My wife saw this color/style on some female singer and had to have them. Lots of female celebrities buy these ""male"" high-tops. Which I find interesting, it doesn't look bad at all, but it definitely screams trendiness to me. You can google ""celebrity Converse"" to find pictures of the myriad of celebs who don Converse. If you do or do not want to be trendy, is your call, but these are definitely being revived in current ""pop culture"". To my wife, that is great, emulating her favorite artist, to me, I wouldn't be caught dead in them due to that reason alone. Although I thought about buying a matching pair just to confuse her, and be ""that"" weird matching couple, since pop culture has made them unisex lol.Hope that helps!",positive
"I've been wearing Chuckie's since I was a kid(over 40 years!!). Original Chuck Taylor's are the biggest icon ever to hit sneakers, with the same bulletproof looks and simple construction throughout the years. They might offer zero arch support(easily fixed with a set of insoles), and can wear down a bit faster than newer brands, but there is no denying that, for the price paid, there's no finer example of what a sneaker is.With all of the new colors available, it has and will always be the king....buy a pair and find out for yourself why.",positive
Excellent!! They fit my daughter perfectly. They are her second pair . The first pair lasted and lasted !ThAnks for a great pair of shoes !,positive
"you know the shoe and you know the star. the comfort level is the truth and they feel so good and have much style and Profile then as now. I have bought Chucks all through the years and they are always chill and they got style. real nice, real nice.",positive
"Bought these for him and he enjoyed them. Very flexible and easy on your feet. I own a pair of these myself, and although the sole can get scuffed very easily, it's still a great shoe in regards to running or when you need black shoes for your outfit. Runs a half size bigger than usual so know your size before you order onlinel",positive
Got (the white) these for my 7 year old he loves them...they are realy cute and they fit him realy nice...Shoe is 100% and he says they are very comfortable,positive
"Cute. Functional, Comfortable, Easy to Clean. My daughter liked the all black design. Exact same quality always delivered by Converse.",positive
"I SEND THEM TO MY GREAT NIECE IN LAS VEGAS AND SHE LOVES THEM, EVERYONE KNOWS THE QUALITY OF CONVERSE, I HAVE BEEN WEARING THEM SINCE I WAS A CHILD MYSELF.",positive
"I didn't get my All-Stars on Amazon, but I wanted to write a review. I actually bought mine used on eBay about two years ago in June 2012. Like other reviews note, they do run large. I normally wear a size 10.5-11, but got a size 10 and they fit comfortably. I bought gray hi-tops with red trim. I initially got them for dead-lifting back when I trained with weights. Since then, I've been using them for casual wear and they've held up very well. I currently live in northern New Jersey and these shoes are nice for non-winter conditions. The shoe has eyelet vents, so when there's a lot of rain, snow or slush on the sidewalks, you may want to go with something else.",positive
"Arrived in good time, fit like a dream, perfect for the actor playing Gladys Herdman!  Just a little pricey but worth it. .",positive
My 13 year old daughter loves this shoe and said it looks even better than displayed. It's very comfortable and the price appeared to be the lowest that we saw at the time the order was placed.,positive
Get these! They stay on!! Yes they are a pain to get on.. But they stay on... And are super stylish. Good for playing or dressing you little one up on showing him off!,positive
Bought as a replacement for kid brother. Item as describe! Size is true and recommended for teens since shoe does not go out of style.,positive
"Got so many compliments on the color. They look really nice on and are so comfortable. Wore them with my Breast Cancer Awareness shirt and jewlry, and they matched perfectly!",positive
She has long somewhat wide feet and she wears these every damn day.  I love that she likes them so much but she never wants to take them off. She says they are very comfortable.,positive
"I remember buying these exact same Chucks for 39.99 not too long ago what happened since then? Other than that, still a great shoe, comfortable and classic. Wear them with anything anywhere. I did buy my normal size and half a size down but I ended up keeping my normal size. The smaller size did fit but I was more comfy in my normal size, I don't feel that they run abnormally large. I am now ready to order in pink and green next. I love the high tops, I never liked how the low tops looked on me, the high tops offer more option and style in my opinion.",positive
"They are nice shoes, well made & highly rated, but they were a gift that I bought for my husband... a bit too early.  I got them a month in advance, so my the time he opened them and tried them out to find they were too big, they store selling them through Amazon said they would not do a refund or exchange.  My fault... I was just trying to be on top of things.  Will know better next time.",positive
"These shoes are worn very regularly by most of my family for nearly barefoot comfort. We like the colors and the look of them. I like the pink ones, because when I was a kid my mother told me I could be invisible in pink sneakers. I have 2 pairs of the high tops, one pair is 5 years old and while they are limp and a bit faded, the soles are still in decent condition. I also have a pair of the oxfords in raspberry rose which is just a fantastic pink color, and doesn't seem to be fading fast. My daughter loves her Skydiver Blue pair.They don't offer any support and they do run large. But as long as you aren't doing a lot of walking, they are very comfortable and light weight. I use my oxfords as slip ons with the laces tied a bit loose.",positive
i think that this sneaker was a bit tight but otherwise a good buy. waiting to procure a similar item.,positive
"I didn't realize that I was suppose to purchase a whole size down, gave them to someone else and now they don't have my size anymore=-(",positive
"My daughter found these at a major department store, the last pair they had and the clerk went to check the sizes and had one 6 and one 8 so she checked other stores and we could not get any.  I came home and looked them up and they were basically the same price and they were sent to my door.  Now for a dance team she needs another pair and I will just order them from here, so easy! Thanks!",positive
"While I have to agree that these seemed better years ago, they were still what I was looking for and what I expected.  Received quickly and fit well.  You can't beat the classics.",positive
I live by converse. I wear converse everyday. It goes with everything and I love it. I really liked the black one and had always wanted to own one so I am happy XD,positive
This pair was for my son. All 5 of mine love these shoes and wear them until they are literally in tatters.,positive
"Retro shoe, great fit for toddlers with a little extra to room for wide baby feet. Look really cute, good price",positive
"I like the shoes but they sent me the wrong color (Kelly green instead of Charcoal) so I had to return them and order the correct color again which is a somewhat hassle.  Shoes runs a bit bigger but not too much; I had to tie the laces a little tighter.  They are good looking with reasonable comfort but not too much arch support. I guess you can say they are a fashion statement and good for short walks.  Overall, I like them.",positive
"The Converse Unisex Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops were a gift that I gave to my Nephew from the Netherlands. This is what he picked out from many possible choices. They were sent to him and as far as I know he liked them very much. Apparently, they were very popular in Holland. He was 16 at the time and in high school.",positive
"I wore these in the rain , and they did excellent.I love them , ohh an d a FREE pair of shoe laces came along . YAAAY !",positive
Fit is true to size and she loves them.  She is fourteen and they are apparently all the rage.  Not good for someone with a wide foot.,positive
"Nothing to tell you more about these shoes of what you surely already know. They are great, my favorite ones even because I live in the Caribbean and the canvas is fresh and my feet don't like sweating...",positive
"I wear a size 7M and was leery about ordering one size smaller, but did it and I am very happy. I use orthopedics in-soles which fit inside nicely too. Very comfortable shoe and quality is excellent. Highly recommend. With Amazon, if the shoe doesn't fit, return it for the right size, but on your initial order I recommend ordering 1 size smaller.",positive
"These boots are so comfortable I wear them almost every day, I combine everything. I am very happy with this purchase.",positive
It's a Chuck Taylor through and through. Not much support but I don't care. These were for my son and he wears a custom orthotic anyway. So we just dropped it in and he was good to go. He wore these with his tux for the prom. He was stylin' and comfortable. I do recommend going up 1/2 size if you have narrow feet and a full size if you have a medium width because they run a bit short.,positive
"Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size. They were good enough to send UPS to my door to retrieve the sneakers. I loved them, but they didn't fit the baby. :) I would highly recommend buying these!",positive
Good fit for my son who has a slender foot.  Good colors to choose from.....good fit......all good! Try a pair and see!,positive
i liked the idea of getting a pair of converse b/c my now fiancee has a pair he wears all the time. i found this pink pair and i love them.,positive
Excellent quality.,positive
"I now have several in white, red, and black... I might just have to get a couple more, you can never have too many shoes",positive
I have always liked Converse All Stars and when I saw the charcoal color I had to have them. The size is good for me.  I had a blue pair (low tops) last year and they were snug on my right foot because of a previous injury.  Those were a size 8 so I got these in size 9 and now no more pain :) .  They run narrow in my opinion so if your foot is a bit wide I'd size up.,positive
"These are extremely tight, and they are meant to. I have some back problems and often wear these under my regular clothes. They help compress my muscles and help align everything. By the end of the day, I'm sore but the next day I feel great. Will definitely buy more.",positive
"The shirt is fine, good quality, fresh, comfortable, like the picture. It is a little delicate if you touch with it surfaces irregular... some strip can fall out. I bought two sizes more thinking about my son could wear it for more time and it will not fit too tight like picture... maybe that is uncomfortable for a kid BUT although that size fit relax but fine the sleeve is too long, I had to cut it so I think that the better way is to buy it in the correct size or maybe one size more and cut the sleeve. Wherever, my son loves to wear this tee.(Sorry for my english)",positive
"First off, I just ordered the shirt late Thursday night & received it at 9am Saturday; talk about fast delivery! I was told delivery wouldn't take place until 12/21 - 12/27, so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great. I can't tell you how well it fits as it's a gift for my son.",positive
both love these shirts.. I get the grey ones for son and white for hubby. They keep the moisture off them when they work and play and a perfect everyday undershirt.,positive
"I am a huge fan of Under Armour's workout apparel, and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts, also own several each of Under Armour's Tech T-shirts (0382) and the Loose Gear shirts (0084) - I've written reviews on those as well.Ok, let's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt. It isn't for everybody. It's tight - a compression fit, the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights, but on your upper body. Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit, and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that, it's a high-quality, great-performing shirt. It provides a lot of muscle support, and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry. As I said, not everyone will like the fit, especially at first, but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings. Athletes in competitive team sports - football, hockey, etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you don't have a perfect body needn't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support, regardless of what sport or workout you are into. In fact, if you're just a little bit soft, it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks. You can always wear another shirt over it if you're self-conscious, just don't like how it looks on you, or haven't quite burned off enough fat yet. If you have a good physique, what can I say - you're going to look hot in this shirt. In fact, it's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first. I usually wear a size XL in the other, looser Under Armour shirts, but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these. They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight. I love this shirt in black, but there's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you can't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry. UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat, and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off. I've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up, even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat, but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch (a lot!). Either way, I haven't taken any chances.",positive
"I got two of these shirts in anticipation of the DC summer heat.  Got to try them out for the first time today during my morning run.  Kept me cool and wicked away sweat quite nicely.  A word of caution, they are a bit sheer, so if you're bashful get a darker color.",positive
"I fell in love with Under Armour's products four years ago, and that hasn't changed.They were still a niche brand then, on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ...Gear products are the reason why. They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first, not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams. I tried some of the competitors first, but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one. I'm glad I did. The HeatGear material is perfect. It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me, that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version. I like the sleeveless version for working out, because it helps your range of motion with your arms. The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt, but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt. UA has started to offer a sleeved ""Tactical"" version of the shirt, which I might buy one or two, but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton.  The hold you in place.  You are not as hot as some may be while working hard.  You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money, and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can.",positive
"This shirt feels great at the gym.  It limits the outward appearance of sweat, allows for your body to cool off while working hard.. Comfort is key when working out, and so is working out and not have to worry if you have giant pit stains.  Wonderful shirt",positive
"I love UA products and buy only compression fit. I am a medium at 155 lbs. 5'7"". I ordered a large and it was way too tight in the armpits due to the shortness of the sleeves. Hence the reason why UA is now making them with the longer sleeves. I wish they would carry the 3/4 sleeve more.",positive
"is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do, other brands or kinds are just not good enough, high quality and low price is all i need",positive
"Great fabric and tight fit.  Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall, then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso.  This company does not listen to the customer.",positive
"there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I'm not gonna lie... I've tried a few of them to save a little money. but i ended up being very disappointed every time. then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it. it is such a great line of products, and very versatile. i use it for hunting, i use it for running, i use it at work. it's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour, it's going to be a solid product. keep up the great work.",positive
fits true to size i can wear this with anything since it being a darker shade of purple wont stand out as much but still has that color its great just what i was looking for totally would recommend to anyone!,positive
I got these as a gift for my little sister. She had been wanting a pair of these for a really long time. I was so happy to find them here on amazon for the cheapest price ;) She absolutely LOVES these and wears them every day. great deal.,positive
My daughter loves converse so the fact that it fit her witout us having to return or try on in the store was a plus - it arrived on time,positive
"I love these shoes. True to form, these Converse fit well. I love the brightness of the light orange color.",positive
These fit great and feel great to walk around in. I highly recommend these shoes to anyone for a great shoe for the summer.,positive
"My wife loves the shoes, however the size convertion was a little off no biggie, just send 'em back and get the right size.",positive
"I've been looking for red chucks for a while now. I love these!! I would recommend getting a half size to a full size smaller though, they run quite large.",positive
"Converse has been making these for as long as my kid has been on Earth and longer and now he's asking for them. He loves them. This is his 4th pair, each in assorted colors. Nothing to complain about whatsoever. They don't really change much - which is **exactly** the point, right?",positive
I bought these for my grown daughter for Valentine's Day and she loved them!  They fit perfectly.  Any age would love them..,positive
"My 4 yr old son needed black shoes for a play he was in. I didn't want to buy dress shoes as he would not get any additional wear out of them. I opted for these black Converse. They were adorable, they fit him well - he is about a size 11 little kids but I ordered the 12 and they are fine with a bit of growing room.  He calls them his &#34;Chucks&#34; and thinks he's cool when he wears them...well, he is pretty cool - he has worn them several times since the play so overall, it was a good purchase.",positive
"Love my new, black converse!!! Nice fit and go well with my new pants!!! Very pleased with the product and delivery!! Thank you!!",positive
"Ok the title is based on Julie Sarinana  check out her blog and you too will see why.  The shoes arrived on time to my girlfriend house.  A perfect fit she said, as she is wearing a mens 4.5 for her 6.5.  Strange I know but that how they are listed.  I purchased these Converse in White Canvas shoes for my little asian cutie she is 5'1&#34;  and maybe 118lbs.  My girlfriend will be wearing these new Canvas Converse at Disneyland.  She'll copy the amazing fashion style recommendation in Sincerely Jules  web site.  The complete outfit for the day at disney:  Tangerine Sweatshirt, Crisp WHITE Roxy Cotton Shorts, Sneakers: White Canvas Converse Chuck Taylors, Sunglasses: Karen Walker.  Another great purchase.  Enjoy your All Star White Canvas Shoes.  I am sure enjoy my asian cutie wearing hers.",positive
"Nice quality, great fit, and a fun pair of shoes that are reflective of my personality. Makes you stand out.",positive
"I bought these for my eight year old little sister and she's loving them. She says they are very confortable, very bright and vivid color and loves showing them off. Her first pair of chucks! I'm a proud sister! Very good buy, arrived pretty quickly as well. Great stiching and laces (came with two pair-black and white) If you're getting these shoes to work in, I don't recommend. They are made tobe confortable but have very little sole support and the toes are kinda squished so perfect for little feet (like mine and sister's)  I have bought three pairs from this site, very great buy!",positive
These run bigger than normal tennis shoes...my son has only worn these since he was born. We are on our 19th pair and get tons of use out of them!!,positive
"I have wanted Green chuck taylors for the longest time!  I got these right away and loved them!  They are the bright kelly green as pictured.  I am a women's 7.5 usually, but 7's fit perfectly.  I was also really happy with the price this seller had it as.  Anywhere else seemed to be $60 or more!  Can't complain about these shoes at all except that I'm worried about getting them dirty!",positive
Love itWas a pr&auml;sentIt was verry NiceEvery BodyLiked itAnd gave onlyCompliment's on the item,positive
I had been wearing converse for years I had them in every single color but never an all white pair lol so I ordered them and they just look amazing with anything u wear I usually wear a 5.5 in boys I ordered a 4.5 in men's they fit a little big so for next time I'll ordered a size 4.0 overall I live them shipping only took 2 days I would recommend.,positive
I got these to replace a pair of the exact color that I got in 1995.  They &#34;mysteriously&#34; disappeared when we moved. I love love these shoes.  They are the classic in a really fun color.,positive
"From high school on, these have been a staple. Nothing much to them, just canvass and a fairly poorly supported insole on a fairly sturdy shoe bottom.  Cool and comfortable, these are the perfect &#34;knocking around&#34; shoes. No delivery issues - came in the two business days promised by Prime.",positive
I GOT MY SHOES IN THE MAIL VERY FAST I LOVE THEM THEY GO WITH EVERYTHING I WEAR I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THEM.,positive
"Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Lo Top Black Monochrome CanvasI love this Converse, excellent quality and stile looks sexy :)",positive
This shoe is as to be expected strong and durable for my teenager - she loves it and I am very happy with this purchase,positive
Ordered for my daughter for Christmas. Fit perfectly and she loves them. I would easily recommend these to anyone. Great shoes.,positive
These are killer--so cute and comfortable.  I recommend for women who don't have a lot of money but want to look chic.  Wear them with black or brown or tan--wear them with anything.,positive
"You cant go wrong with Chucks. I have been wearing them for the passed year out here in Afghanistan. They hold up nicely in the rough terrain and keep my feet cool during the summer months when the temperature reaches 130 F degrees.  When I am back in the states, I wear pencil skirts and pumps to the office but I will never outgrow Chucks. I wear them on the weekends during coffee runs or for grocery shopping.",positive
"this sneakers is just what my daughter ask for, the sneaker fit her great. the sizes are true to what they say they are.and converse sneakers last a long time. it a real good value for these shoe, worth every penny.",positive
"If you want Chucks, you're gonna get Chucks. Just be aware that the support in them is pretty poor. Walking in them makes me feel like I have a high ankle sprain.",positive
Got these for my niece for her birthday. She seems to like them. They fit perfect soooo yeeaah that's it,positive
These were huge for my son.  Which is likely on me... we just put them in his closet for next year and bought a second smaller size for this year.,positive
I did not know that Converse stooped that low to get their products made in Vietnam or else I would never have bought them for my young nephew.,positive
"I get compliments on these shoes everytime I wear them.  The fit perfectly as expected and are very comfortable.  If you are considering whether to purchase them or not, DO IT! You won't regret it.  They also make a good gift for all ages.  These shoes are timeless.",positive
"Okay I love everything Converse. I already had pairs of Converse in sizes that fit me, so sizing wasn't an issue at all, I ordered the size that all my other Converse are, and it fit me well.The green color is just awesome though, lots of people have commented on them. I like Converse in every color, but the greens are probably one of my favorites.If you like Converse All-Stars and you like the color green, then go for it.",positive
"I chose gray/white, they look & feel great. I wear them all the time, and of course they get a little dirty.",positive
Purchased these for my 12 yr old daughter and she is in love with them.. wears them EVERY day.  Shipping time was immediate!  I cannot complain.,positive
Very nice looking shoe and very comfortable !! You can wear them all day and no problems.I bought them for my daughter and she loves them .,positive
always wear a size 11 in every shoe.  these were too big but i wear an orthotic/insole so they were perfect.  most definitely order a size down,positive
"They fit great width wise but seem a little long, but I think that's just how Chuck's are. I wear size 7.5 in  women's shoes and the 5.5 were a good fit for me.",positive
"I really love shoes. I'm always looking for shoes. This pair cought my atention because of its color, a very nice and uniform green that goes perfectly ok with jeans or shorts. I use to wear them for my afternoon walks, to go to the beach and for any casual event like coffee with friends, the movies and so. I like these shoes a lot!!",positive
My 11 year old granddaughter asked for these for her birthday.  I was happy to find these Converse shoes on Amazon and the price was less than any other site!  She beamed when she opened them and couldn't wait to try them on!  They were perfect!  I was so pleased that she liked them and I got to be a big hit with my granddaughter!,positive
Great shoes good price arrived quickly great Job Love the shoes what else can I say Converse shoes like these are cool and durable  Happy customer,positive
"I enjoy them every time I wear them. Comfortable, sporty and hip enough so that my daughter's friends actually listen to me.",positive
DONT stop selling the low top of these chuck taylors. I keep finidng high top ones but finally found these low top ones and boy EVERBODY loves these shoes on my baby boy!! I must admit they look so much better on him than I even thought. I am so pleased Im gonna buy another pair in a different color. They really do look awesome on and as long as these shoes havebeen around they still top the cake with comparable cloth sneakers!,positive
"This Product is highly recommended.Ordered my regular shoe size. Perfect fit.Color, Material and size exactly what I wanted.",positive
"I love these shoes, so cute and I wear them every day! I wish I had them in every color. And they shipped so fast",positive
"the shoes look good, they are confortable, and the price is not that high, these are the classic converse, they are good",positive
"They fit better as expected, I'm a 12 EE and the 12 M fit fine. I ended up returning to get something else but they fit good (even if you have duck feet like me) and arrived as described.",positive
For a long long time I have wanted a pair of these in pink. I think years ago these were made only for males because my brothers had them. From time to time I have seen them but never in pink. Well finally pink and I jumped on them as soon as I saw them. I have worn them and got some really nice compliments. I am a &#34;young&#34; senior and I wore these with my crop jeans and with my long jeans folded up and they really look great! I am a fashionista!,positive
I keep buying this shoe because I know exactly what size I need and it's comfortable and Converse doesn't change it to something that doesn't work.,positive
"I keep buying both the low profile and high top versions for my son as he grows, and he loves them. The shoe fits nice, has a good flexible sole for running on both pavement and grass, so for a toddler, that is a plus. Also, he can wear them all day, and is comfortable. I think the fabric is good for developing feet that need to stretch, but still give enough support. He likes these way better than the Saucony's I bought him, which seemed to never break in, and were a bear to put on.",positive
"I bought these shoes specifically to wear while I am performing squat exercises when working out. Of course, I wear them for the whole workout, not just during the squat. I don't wear them any other time, they are strictly gym shoes for me.For working out they are excellent. They keep my feet flat and stable when I am straining to lower and raise the weight bar on my shoulders. They are comfortable and utilitarian during the other exercises.I would not wear them as everyday shoes - to me they are not *that* comfortable. I only wear them for about six hours a week, but they are good quality and still look brand new after many months. If they wear out before I do, I will certainly replace them with the same brand and style.",positive
I love my classic converse! The are very comfortable and I can wear them with pretty much anything! I love them! They are exactly what they described them to be! Very nice!,positive
"Hey, it's Converse, what more needs to be said???  My son bought these for his girlfriend for Christmas as they were on her Amazon wish list.  Let's hear it for &#34;old school&#34; chic!!!  : )",positive
"Perfect bright color, love these Chucks! A perfect new look for a wonderful classic, goes with everything, but gets noticed, too!",positive
"Getting these in white wasn't that easy, had to wait a couple of weeks for the price and size and color options to be right. But finally got them and my girlfriend was pretty happy! The fit just right.",positive
"Always loved Converse, so this was perfect for my son. He also loves the bright color. The fit is perfect.",positive
daughter loves these shoes for school.  fast shipment with no issues.  will buy again from this seller.,positive
"Purchased for my daughter.  She loves the sneaker, runs slightly larger than normal shoe size.  I would order 1/2 size smaller.",positive
"As anyone who has ever own Chuck's knows, they are narrow. However, they stretch out after a while. My husband has wanted a pair for a few years now and this was the only place I could find his size. He has big old Flintstone feet.",positive
I had to get these for a wedding.  Let's just say technology has made more modern shoes more comfortable. Liked 'em more when I was 8.,positive
"I've many many pairs of Chucks in my life and these were just what I expected. True to size, great color, and awesome quality. The shipping time was decent.",positive
"These shoes hold up better than any of the imitation ones I have tried with a similar style, so they are all I was hoping for.  Good quality and the style I like.",positive
"My granddaughter put these on her 13th birthday gift list and I was fortunate to get the last pair in this size and color. (Evidently no other color would do.) Personally, I thought they looked a bit stiff and uncomfortable, but she seemed to find them just right. I loved them because she loved them.",positive
"This is a great looking, simple looking sneaker or deck shoe in a variety of colors. I wear an 11 1/2 EW (EEE). These shoes were only offered in D widths, so I bought 12D. It fits my foot length and width, but it's a little tight from the top of my foot to the sole of my foot. I wear a 1/2"" lift in my left shoe, but it won't fit in this shoe. I wear this sneaker without my lift if I'm driving with only short walks outside the car. The soles don't afford much protection if I step on a walnut in my back yard - so I try not to do that. I bought these shoes in green and red. The first time I wore them, a young man passed me and said, ""Great Chucks.""",positive
these chucks in the charcoal color are darker in person than in the picture.  they are true to size for my husband and they are a great neutral color.,positive
"When buying Converse brand shoes be sure to buy them a size smaller than what you would normally wear with most other brands. Converse uses a different measuring system than other major brands (which makes no sense to me), which is why you should order about a size smaller for males or females. I ordered a female size 7.5 for someone who normally wears a 8.5 in women, and it fit well. Hope this helps!",positive
"I've always loved Converse shoes as they are trendy and comfy. I absolutely love the shoes, though the color I chose (Parasailing) it's a little bit different from the one shown in the picture, a little more towards green than turquoise. Nevertheless, I am happy with my purchase. The seller is concerned about getting feedback from the customer on their overall purchase experience., which I think it's great.",positive
"Absolutely Love them. Quick shipment, perfect fit, color and comfort! Love them. Cant say anything negative about them. Hope everyone else enjoys",positive
"I wanted a pair of low-cut Cons All-Stars for just hanging out, and as a reminder of the ones I wore as a kid.  But for sure I didn't want to spend a hundred bucks!  These are great.  Fit is good, quality good, and they came with an extra pair of shoelaces!  No arch support at all,  but you need to know that before you buy, so you won't be disappointed.  I put in a pair of my Dr. Schols inserts and I'm a happy camper, lol.  Have been wearing them constantly since they arrived.",positive
"These shoes are true to size, are authentic converse, are comfortable, and arrived on time and in the correct color.  My only complaint about converse is that they are a bit too narrow. However you can find them at pretty much any shoe store so you can always try them on first before you buy them.  I am happy about the price too (they were $10 more expensive at DSW than here on amazon).  They don't offer much in terms of arch support, but overall I can't complain.",positive
"I have been wearing Chucks since I came out of the womb. I've been through many pairs, and after I decided to retire my old black ones due to a blown out heel I wanted to go with something new. The white is really an eye catching color, and more subdued in person than some of the pictures out there. BE WARNED, Chucks are about a size bigger than your actual shoe size. For example I wear a size 7 in women's, which would be a size 5 in Chucks, but these are really too big so I went with the size 4. I find the white adds some contrast, especially if you wear dark colors like I do.",positive
"If you didn't already know, make sure you order 1/2 a size smaller then you normally would when ordering Converse.Love these shoes.",positive
These are green converse and they are awesome. I am a converse whore. My closet is filled with all the different colors. I can't stop myself!,positive
"I've bought these for work, where I stand for an average of 8 hrs at a time.Comfortable, great traction, inexpensive.",positive
I purchased these classic converse to replace the old ones my boyfriend had. They fit true to size and are very comfortable!,positive
I love these shoes!!!  I am a size 81/2 normally in girls and most shoes look horrible with my skinny jeans.  These shoes make my feet look petit and go perfect with my skinny jeans.,positive
My son has these in every color.  It's difficult to say anything else but that he loves converse shoes. Happy to have purchased.,positive
"I bought them as a present for my boyfriend and he couldn't be happier. The color is vibrant and full of life! Also, converse are great shoes.",positive
"The shoe is as expected, although a little more mushroom colored than the gray I was expecting, and there was no extra pair of black laces even if it clearly stated that there would be. So, the price was good and the shoe fits, but the lack of the &#34;extras&#34; lost it one star in my estimation.",positive
"I have been looking for a great pair of Converse to wear with skirts and dresses. It has taken a while to find the right color, but I love this dark green. It is unique but subtle and very versatile. Obviously, the structure of these shoes is well known, the sole is thick and strong with good tread, and it laces up high. My one issue is they ran a little big. I usually wear a 9 1/2, but I knew I wanted to wear them without socks, so I bought a 9. Even the half-size down, they are a little big. Still, a great shoe and fabulous color!",positive
"I thought I'd never be able to wear chucks because I'm a half size, and they only seem to sell whole sizes at the stores. I finally realized I could just buy them online! The shoes took about a week to wear in, but now they fit my feet perfectly.",positive
Great shoes!  Reliving my younger days is great in these authentic Chuck Taylors!  Retro never looked so good!  Love them!,positive
Chuck Taylors are about as classic a pair of sneakers you can buy.  These pink ones have a great bubblegum color and are perfect for the lady in your life who wants to rock pink kicks and look cool.,positive
This are my favorite shoes.  For some reason they make me feel slightly quirky.  I wear them whenever I need a little positive mental boost (like taking a mid-term!).,positive
"These are the standard Chuck Taylors so not a ton to say but...* These are MUCH brighter than the picture, at least in pink.  It's refreshing but also a bit intimidating.* I said in another review for a different color that buyers should go half a size lower than normal.  I repeat that here in this case.",positive
"This is my second pair of chucks so I kind of knew what to expect. I also have a pair of high tops and love them but decided to get a low top for the summer. I got them in carmine rose and they are such a pretty color, so glad I went with them! It is a light and airy shoe for spring and summer and the color isn't too girly or childish, I just love it. They will look cute with anything from shorts to skirts to jeans. Converse is a go to classic. But, if you need arch or ankle support these are not for you.",positive
First pair of converses and look really good. I went with red cause its cheap but they look great!! word,positive
"I love converse SO much. i wore my old ones until they had holes in them and were falling apart. i just got these and of course I LOVE THEM. they are 100% REAL AUTHENTIC converse. the shipping was extremely fast, and very safely packaged :) thank you so much",positive
I love these. So cute and just right,positive
I love them in every color!! :) The shoes are simple and perfect! I have worn them for many years and I will continue to do so! I highly recommend these!,positive
These are classic Converse shoes.  They arrived quickly.  The fit was true to size and they look great with our school uniform.,positive
"Its not that white as expected but it was fine, it was what i expected only the white was kinda like a beige.",positive
"Product itself was great, but the size wasn't marked well, so I ordered a 2 toddler.  My daughter is 8 years old so I needed a 2 youth.  Watch the size you order!",positive
"Fits well, looks good. Great work apparel for working in a game studio &#128515;A little narrower than I'm used to. Fit is nicer though.",positive
"I had been wanting another pair of the unbleached Converse Chuck Taylor's for years.  I am so glad that they fit the same as they did years ago.  My feet are a little wide.  So I order the unisex size and not the women's shoes, as I find the women's fit snugger.  These are made well and I'm completely satisfied.",positive
I love my chucks they fit perfect. It was exactly what I expected and at a great price. I would definitely recommend it to everyone that falls between sizes cuz the stores usually only Carrie the full sizes. Half sizes make a difference.,positive
"I bought these for my 13 yr old son.  They cost about the same price at the mall but it's always a plus when you can avoid going to the mall.  Chuck's run larger so you have to get a size smaller than what you would normally wear.  I found that out when I had to do a return and reorder.  Other than that, he seems to like his Chuck's.  I've bought a few more in different colors because he likes them so much.",positive
"I ride horses and some of them are a little on the rough side when it comes to trotting. I feel totally secure with this item holding in the 'girls.' There is a little bit of bounce, but I guess if there wasn't any, I'd be a boy. ha haDefinitely want to order a size larger than what you'd usually wear. It can run a little on the tight side. After washing, it feels tight, but then after a day, it stretches out enough to be comfortable.It does take a few wears to get used to it and to ""mold"" it to your body. It can be quite uncomfortable at first...feel like a straight jacket....but only at first, then it's great. You don't notice you've got it on.I'd recommend this for anyone who wants a good hold. I'm not crazy about the pink color, but what the heck, it's not lingerie!",positive
"I love this bra, fits tight and holds the girls in but i will say right after i got it one of the snaps broke off i think it was defective so now i have a bra i paid alot for that one hook can't be snapped but other then that i love it, i have went thru alot of bra's and this is by far the best support it is kinda hot and takes a little getting used to it is my first compresion bra, so that may be it for me, but i would say if you are larger busted try it, i just wish my bra would not have broke it would have got 5 stars if it had not broke. i was very disapointed in that but like i said not one of the other snaps have broke so i really think it was a defect of some kind.",positive
"This is the only sports bra that I have ever worn that can also be used as a minimizer as well. It worked very good at flattening my big chest making it impossible for the big huge sacks I call breast to even budge one centimeter.The downfalls of this bra is that it is hard to put on the first time and really does not break in and feel comfortable and natural until you have worn the thing many times. Also it took time to put the bra on as it has over 10 hooks to fasten painstakingly one at a time.However, the positive is that I had this same model bra for over 2 years and has survived constant wear, tear, and abuse.To sum up this review it is worth the money if you are up to enduring some discomfort until the bra breaks in and is looking for an excellent minimizer.AS for an actual sports bra for activities where you will be doing alot of moving and flexing of the upper body I do not recommend this bra. You might want to try the Moving Comfort line as they have excellent support for big chests.",positive
"This is definately a great bra, well made but it runs alittle small, imo.  It has a great support built in and I'm sure it would last a long time as the quality is great. I will try for another size!",positive
This is a great product! It offers the best support for me when I go for a jog or just working out at the gym.  It holds you in place and you don't have to worry about any bounce.  You'll feel super supported and won't want to use another bra after trying this one out!,positive
"It was easy to follow the sizing guide and the bra I received fit appropriately (it's supposed to be tight!). I like fastening it in the front instead of the back, but there are quite a few hooks that can be tedious to fix up each time. I was disappointed in the efficacy of the bra for vigorous activity. This was my last stop in my tour of expensive sports bras that the interwebs say are best for ladies with large breasts, and I was hoping that it would blow the competition out of the water. It didn't. It's playing nicely with the other bras in the water. This bra works fine, but I didn't find it to be anything special.",positive
"If you are a busty woman (anywhere from C cup or above), then this bra is for you.  I have tried numerous other (very expensive) sports bras, but none has provided the level of support AND comfort that the Enell does.  Now, I have no problem with the fact that there are no strap adjustments, but apparently some women find the straps are too short/long for them.  It fits me perfectly and I have changed sizes over the years.  Be sure to take the time to measure your rib cage (below the breast) and across your breasts to determine the correct size to order.  The basic calculation is breast size (let's say a 40) minus rib cage size (say 34) equals your cup size (40-34 = 6).  Count the alphabet to 6 letters (in our example, F) and that's your cup size.  Many products use double and triple D, so an F = DDD as well.  As anyone with large breasts knows, it can be difficult to get excited about exercise when every bounce hurts, but exercise is SO important for our physical and mental health.  So take a little time to figure out your size, and spend a little extra money, and get a good bra!",positive
This may be a good sports bra but it is for smaller cup sizes with larger band sizes. A lot of hooks to fasten.,positive
"I'm a very active person with a 34DDD chest.  I am forever on a search for the perfect bra.  For sports, this is it.  I can wear it in my highest impact activities, and everything stays put.  It's not really attractive, and sure doesn't look great with a spaghetti strap work out top, but it does the job.  Getting into it is a little tricky; you start at the bottom hook and work your way up, adjusting your breasts as you go.  It is supposed to feel tight, so you might think you have the wrong size at first.  But after wearing it for a few minutes it feels comfortable.  ZERO bounce or movement.  Incredible!",positive
I usually wear a regular bra plus two to three sports bras. Now I can wear just one. It is amazing!,positive
"38DD.  You MUST use the Enell specific sizing chart--as far as I can tell it's not on the Ammy link, so use the website for your measurements!It's Ugly, it squishes, and the fit feels weird at first and did I mention ugly?It's also long lasting, and does what it's supposed to.  Keeps the girls still so I can go running.  I would not wear it for anything but exercise because after I'm done it would get a little uncomfortable.  However, I've done up to 2.5 hrs of running and done sprint triathlons in this bra.There is only one other bra I find as satisfactory (and only discovered it because Enell would not ship to APO/FPO...and in fact would not even ship to a different address to let someone else mail it to me--my BILLING address was FPO and they refused to service that...so don't try and buy this as a gift if you are going through Enell...obviously that was before I could pay for it on Amazon...but I digress).Despite my unhappiness with Enell, I do love the product and I'm vey happy ordering via Amazon has made purchasing this product a viable option again.  Particularly as I start making plans to do another sprint triathlon, this style works very well under my suit.Extremely Highly Recommended for larger busted people who are doing something high impact like running.JTG",positive
"I love this bra.  I am a competitive, thin, fit 44 yo with 34F busts so over the years certain body parts have moved a bit southward and there is a lot of postential for jiggling to outright flopping.  In this Enell Sport Bra I can run and jump with no unwanted movement.  It is a compreesion bra, so you are going to have a mono-boob, but it is the only bra I can run in that does the job without chafing.  And when I am working out hard I'm a make-upless, hair-puled-back, sweaty mess, so what do I care if I have one compressed motionless boob?Most of the negative reviews of this bra are folks who couldn't get into it, so I figured I wuld tell you the easiest way:1. First put your arms through the arm holes as though you were putting on a vest.2. Leave your boobs where they are: if they are down by your lower rib cage, your belly button or tucked into your waistband, just leave there.3. Grasp your Enell Sports Bra by the bottom two front clasps and lift up (vertically) so you are NOT pulling it across your boobs, but over the top of your boobs across your chest at arm pit height.4. Hook the bottom to clasps so that the bra is closed at the bottom but contains no boobs.5. Using your right hand, go through the inside of the bra and scoop up your left boob and pull it ino the bra.  Do the same with your left hand, right boob.6. Arrange your boobs so they are comfortable and facing the same direction, then easiely hook the rest of the clasps from the bottom up.Ta-Da!I will say this is a LOT of bra. If you are a cup size C or smaller this may not be the bra for you.  If you do not do a lot of high impact movements (running, jumping, karate, burpees, pogo-sticking) you probably do not need a bra this sturdy.  For example, I do not need to wear my Enell when I am weight training or biking.  However, if you are an older lady who maybe has had a couple of kids and gravity has done its thing, this may be the bra for you; or if you are a younger gal who is well endowed and have seen your mother naked and don't want the same fate to befall you, then you may want to wear a Enell to ward off the horrors of gravity for as long as possible.",positive
"I have tried several types of sports bras, but always come back to the Enell.  Have to admit, they aren't the most attractive but you will not find a better supporting sports bra.  I wear a D cup in a regular bra.  I can run wearing the Enell with no bounce and it makes my run so much more comfortable.  I would tell every women to at least try it.  In support and comfort, you will not be disappointed.",positive
"This bra is great for running... The girls stay in place!  It's a different feel with this sports bra than with others, but once you get used to it, this bra is perfect for high impact activities.",positive
"Okay, I normally wear a 40 band bra, and an F/G cup depending on the brand. In a Lane Bryant Full Coverage bras I wear a 40DDD. I followed the measurements and this bra holds very well, but I have spillage at the sides and the top. The band fit correctly and I honestly feel if I went up a size the band would be too big. For myself I will seek a bra with cups and not numbers. This bra is awesome if you are a 40 DD, (40 DDD the biggest) as the sizing chart states. I give credit to the fact that for the cup sizes provided was correct. I guess my &#34;girls&#34; are just way too big. I will keep it and wear a compression vest on top of it.  My measurements did fit a size 4 though, so for ladies looking for some serious hold, definitely get this.",positive
"This bra is very durable and I love the thick straps that do not cut into my shoulders - LOVE IT!  However, the measurement method and sizes will not always be correct, as the recommended way to measure may be correct but the sizes recommended are not.I did the measurements as instructed and was given a size to buy and the cups are way too small - my breasts are spilling out on the sides.  Some may be wanting to say go a size bigger but if I do, the bra will be too slack, as it is the bra is very comfortable but the cups are way off.  I need a bra just like this but with bigger cups.  Any recommendations?",positive
"If you like breasts that are cube-shaped, this is the one for you! As much as I loved the back of this bra, I positively gasped at how it made my chest look. It got rid of any roundness, and just flattened the front...not a flattering look. Returning tomorrow...and the search continues.",positive
I bought a white Enell about 3 years ago and had it fitted in a store. So that was helpful because I was confident in what size I needed to buy. But the size chart provided is helpful and seems to be accurate for me. This is SO supportive and makes my workouts so much better. Also this is the only bra I can run in. I will say the purple one feels slightly cheaper than the white one I bought years ago. The straps are a little papery/less padded. I'm  not sure if that is because it's newer and they have changed them all or just this purple one is different. But either way it's still great and very supportive! Will probably order one more in black just so I have a clean one at all times.,positive
"After putting it on i cant breathe, I bought right size but its still smug. holds great though. Im gonna try a size up, if it werent so expensive",positive
"I had a hard time choosing between the size 2 and 3. (42 bust and 37 rib cage)  The 3 seemed like the best fit for the rib cage, but I thought I'd need a 2 to really compress everything.  I'm glad I went with the 3, because if it were any tighter, and it would probably hurt my rib cage.  As it is, it seems just right.When I first put it on, I thought it wouldn't control bounce enough because it felt just a tad roomy in the top part, but it works!  There's still some movement, but it doesn't hurt at all, and I don't feel like the breath is being squeezed out of me.  In fact, I hardly feel constricted at all, other than in the band around my rib cage, and that part isn't uncomfortable at all. The top and bottom control panels do exactly what the video says--they minimize bounce. I did several jumping jacks without a problem.  It's really  hard to believe that it can do that without being squished too much.It does make you look a little like you're wearing body armor, and under a shirt it definitely doesn't look like you're wearing a normal bra.  But I think it looks fine. It just flattens you, and depending on the fabric you're wearing you can sometimes see the seam between the top part of the bra and the bottom support.  Turbo Kick and the elliptical trainer aren't places to have fashion shows, anyway, though, so I'm definitely keeping mine.Shipper, OneSweetOne, was also fast.  I ordered on a Wednesday, got it on a Tuesday--one day earlier than indicated.UPDATE Jan 31st 2012. I wore my bra to a hip-hop aerobics class and it worked great!  We did a lot of jumping around and bouncing, and I enjoyed it more than I've enjoyed aerobics or dancing in YEARS.  I think there's still a shifting movement in the bra, but I honestly don't notice it since it's not impeding my workout. I feel like I have better balance and control as I move.",positive
"This bra does what it claims it will do--it provides firm support even for plus sized women, and the support doesn't go away after washing.  I just wish it weren't so shiny.  It's not terribly attractive, just functional, but the straps will show with most clothing, so you may want a lacy camisole over this.  Unless they can change the shininess without reducing the support, I'll live with it 'as is'.  A great bra in terms of function!",positive
"I bought the size that fits 34DD and I feel so constricted in this thing! It's not comfortable to run in for me. I feel like I can't draw enough breath. However, it does hold my top in place, so I don't move at all.",positive
"Pros: no bounce, very supportive, holds everything in & even does some minimizing.The big con is their goofy sizing. I ordered according to the measuring system the company uses, which put me right in the middle of the #2 range. It turned out to be too small in the cups, especially. I experienced the same ass everyone else in that the band is waaaaay tight! It gave me head & neck aches wearing it the first few times, though I did not mind the extra back support. I read that this bra is supposed to be extra tight so I just accepted that. But I can't accept boob spillage out the sides & squishing them together in the middle. I love this bra, I love the idea behind what it's supposed to do. I guess I just need to do some re-sizing, maybe up one or two sizes & see how that goes. I really want to love this bra!",positive
"I bought this as a valentine's day present for my partner, and we're both quite impressed with it.  The seams are tough, the fabric is wonderful, and the function is supurb... it keeps her breasts largely immobile even during the most vigorous exercise, and keeps her looking fabulous while she's doing it!",positive
"I've always had a pretty full bust. I remember walking at the track with a friend and trying to jog a bit during the straight stretches...only to have her comment that I really needed to wear a sportsbra to minimize all the bounce. She was shocked when I told her that I actually had two on. Since a pretty dramatic weight gain, the bounce has gotten worse. When I found out my job was sponsoring free zumba classes, I couldn't wait to enroll but felt self-conscious...plus jumping around without good support is very uncomfortable. So when I saw the Enell bra featured on a plus sized fashion blog (with rave reviews), I went ahead and splurged. I have to say that I'm very pleased. The bra compresses but it also provides a lot of lift from below. I feel supported AND lifted instead of just getting squash-chest like the other bras out there. And for the first time since I hit puberty I was able to go for a light jog without feeling like I was pulling a pectoral muscle. Also, because of the unique satin-like material (versus the traditional all-cotton sportsbras), my shirts don't ride up or get stuck on my chest like velcro.Still, I couldn't quite give it a perfect 5-star rating. For one thing, I'm still getting a little bit of a uni-boob. The band fits perfect but the cup size seems a tad small, but I don't want to go up a size and risk not getting a good fit around...speaking of which, it is a bit of an non-traditional fit. The shoulder straps are pretty short and sort of has the bra hiked up in the back...really high. Also, the price makes this a luxury item. I don't know if I will ever own more than one at a time, especially if my weight loss is successful and I go down a size or so. I just hope this bra holds up well with frequent washing.",positive
"If you are blessed/cursed with large breasts you need this bra. I have never had another bra that actually holds you in place comfortably while you exercise without choking you. It is a bit pricey but definitely worth it. I would recommend this to any woman who never thought they would be able to do a jumping jack without hurting themselves or others! Terrific fit, great bra.",positive
"I heard great things about this bra. I am a size 36 E (DDDD) and got the size 3. This should fit based on the measurements provided in the sizing guide. It is hard to get on, so I know I couldn't get a bigger size, but my boobs bounce around like crazy and hurt. I expected to have a lot more support",positive
"I love running, and I hate when flat or small chested woman tell me to get a breast reduction surgery. I wish I could slap them in the face.  its not my fault I have big boobs or that guys prefer my boobs over theirs. I love this bra, it is the best; most supportive bra I have ever had. I can finally run without pain or discomfort.",positive
This bra is so secure and hides some stuff too in the back. The bands on the shoulders are wide and don't hurt.  I love this bra so much that I purchased more of them and wear them as a regular bra. The only thing is sometimes I have to come out of them because of blouses with low cleavage or open shoulders.,positive
i can't wait to try  it on. it is so hard to find comfortable bra's that fit big busted women. i like the fact the hooks are in the front. order came fast!,positive
As a bigger lady its hard to find sports bras that fit and work.  This one is great.  I would suggest looking on enell's website to get your size.,positive
"keeps the ta tas in place!  go to there website for sizing info.  although front clasps are a bit tricky, i feel like i am in some kind of super hero bra suit armor type thing and feel excellent support at the gym.",positive
"I just received this bra and I rate it 4 stars just because it is tight, as mentioned in the other reviews. Otherwise, it looks good, and it seems to perform well. I like the fact that it closes in the front. I will keep it and I hope it will loosen up in time.",positive
"I have used a version of this bag for many years and keep coming back to it.  I tried a Baggallini bag recently and decided I didn't like it so well because it actually had too many compartments for me and I'd forget where I put things.  With the Ameribag, I find things more easily.  I also need to carry a water bottle with me and this bag has just the right amount of space for it, whereas I didn't have that with my Baggallini.  I have lengthened the strap to use it cross-body style, which is more comfortable for me to carry.  The extra-small version is just right for me, a short person.  The larger ones are a little too big.  With this size, I can fit a baglet inside, which can be handy at times.  I like that this nylon bag is washable.  It cleans up easily!",positive
"First one arrived with the little plastic hook that connects the bottom strap broken.  Not sure I like this way of connecting strap seems cheap where metal may be better way, as women even this size is smaller than previous ones owned by LL Bean.  Wanted to have smaller bag hoping to lighten my load, so to speak as my shoulder is paying the price now older. Nice pockets with magnets on outside and set up the same with many pockets. I will use the second one sent to replace first but, will most likely go back to LL Beans.  The only thing on that one after years of use the zipper stopped working.",positive
Great bag and I love the nylon material.  The color in person is richer in red than in the picture.,positive
This bag holds a lot of stuff in easy-to-access pockets.  The wide shoulder strap is very comfortable and has a no-slip backing that keeps it in place.  The overall design of the bag does seem to cause less stress on my shoulder and back.  I will buy another one in a different color.,positive
"Ordered this, my umpteenth Healthy Back Bag, as a tiny accessory to hold my stuff when we go out to dinner. It's the perfect size, unobtrusive, tastefully black, works with anything I wear. Neither too little, and definitely not big. Holds my Blackberry, a notepad, pen, my sunglasses/change of glasses, and a sundry thing or 2.Love it.",positive
"I got the desert color - a fantastic, go-with-everything khaki color. This is a very casual bag, so if you dress up every day, it might not be for you. I love that it has a place for everything and I'm hoping to pick up a larger sized Ameribag for traveling. Now they just need to make a Back Bag for lap tops!added 1/11/2012: I just came back to buy my 3rd Ameribag, the brown one this time - it's a beautiful, rich, cognac color. Love it!  Also a note on Ameribag's customer service and warranty - a strap that holds a d-ring on the inside of one of my other bags ripped.  I gave them a call and they're having me return the bag for fixing or a replacement.  Very easy to deal with and very nice people.",positive
"This is a review of the Crimson color distressed nylon bag, extra small.I have major back problems and chronic pain, and went on a search for a lighter everyday bag. This is perfect. I work in a casual office and can carry this everywhere without worry that it won't be suitable. I have a smaller clutch that I use for occasions that call for more formal attire.While not one of those women who carries around everything but the kitchen sink, I am still amazed at how much I can fit into this bag. Everything that was in my regular purse fits in here, with room to spare. What's more, this bag is noticeably lighter than my purse, which is precisely what I needI agree with other reviewers that the inner water bottle holder is small. However, it does a great job of holding my sunglasses, which is more useful to me for daily use.The only negative is the small, narrow size of the two outer pockets. I love the magnetic closures, but the so-called cell phone pocket is too small for my iPhone with Otterbox case. Instead, I use it for my little pill container. I haven't put anything in the smaller side pocket; seems to small for most things.Other reviewers have rightly pointed out that this is NOT the classic bag, no matter what the advertisement says. It's the newer HBB-evo bag. That doesn't bother me, but it may bother someone else, so I think it's worth mentioning. If you look closely at the picture of the crimson bag, it shows only one flap pocket on the side. There are actually two.I guess I'm so impressed with the overall weight and function of this bag that the outer flap pocket design is really not a big deal. For an organized person like me who strongly believes there should be a place for everything and that everything should be in its place, this is almost perfect.",positive
"This bag is perfect for the new 10"" netbooks. I have an Asus 1000he and have been having trouble finding a lightweight and attractive bag for it. The larger battery (9.5 hrs) makes it just a touch too big for most 10"" bags and sleeves out there.I can fit my netbook in its neoprene sleeve in the main section, portable DVD drive, portable HD, power brick and cords for them all. The outside pocket holds my wallet, Ipod, Iphone, pens and a small pad of paper. My plane ticket goes in the back zippered pocket. There are NO MAGNETS anywhere on this bag.The best part is when I want to travel light, I can take out the rest of the netbook accessories and the bag slims right down. Or I can use this as a lightweight crossbody bag that just happens to have my netbook in it. There is plenty of room for that and purse things.The vertical profile makes it easy to get the netbook in and out and redistributes the weight more ergonomically. Fully loaded, it feels much lighter than a similar horizontal bag. I love that this bag is lightweight to begin with, unlike specialized laptop bags that weigh more than the laptop itself empty!It is not meant to be a laptop bag, but the extra space in the bag enables you to add more padding and protection if you want to and still end up lighter when fully packed than an empty off-the-shelf Staples netbook bag. You'd be a lot more stylish too.The black, navy and slate colors are guy friendly and look like a cool and compact crossbody bag. The shoulder strap extends to comfortably fit a medium-build guy. The main compartment measures 2""depth & the front compartment is an extra 3/4"".",positive
Bag is more of a Christmas Red to me - which I LOVE. Many compartments as I like and this holds twice as much as other brand bags while weighing less. Fits my iPad without a problem (in slim case). The design makes this bag not too bulky for me.,positive
"I purchased this due to the good reviews it has on Amazon. I plan to use it for long day trips, weekend trips, and vacations. It has plenty of room, separate sections, and extras that will work out great for holding all kinds of stuff! I can't wait to use it! I have smaller bags like this where the strap goes across the body, and I prefer that when traveling or walking around all day long, but I definitely needed a bigger one (but not too big - haha). I feel safer knowing it can't be stolen from me and it is also more comfortable to wear. It is made well and I like that the material will repel water. Great bag!",positive
"I own multiples in this style Kipling.  While I think it is plain for me for everyday, it makes a fabulous travel or day trip bag, especially if you have children.  The bag is lightweight with tons of organization.  The strap is comfortable and doesn't rub and burn your skin.  it's a durable but soft, unlike some other nylon strap bags I own (and need to get rid of because they don't compare!)",positive
"I've totally embraced the cross body bag style and I was looking for a brown bag for Fall after enjoying my Keen Brooklyn II Hemp bag all summer and loving all the organization that that one offered. This is almost identical in style so it was easy to transition all of my items into this secure bag and still have them relatively in the same spots. As a bonus - this bag is lighter! It even appears to be water resistant, although I don't plan to test that theory. It holds my wallet, make up bag, small umbrella, two pairs of glasses, ear buds, cell phone, Kindle, and various little items in the interior small zip sections like keys, gum, kleenex, etc.  I even squeezed a lunch bag on top and was still able to zip it shut thanks to the adjustable flap snap.  This will be a great bag for travel as well but for day to day commuting into the city with slots for everything and everything secured with zippers, it's great. And although it lists for $78 on numerous websites, I found it on Amazon for $55. Sweet! Thanks, Amazon! Oh and the monkey is cute too.",positive
"I ordered this ring because I needed something gold on my right hand to go with another ring. It's very pretty, just a bit too yellow. I still like it and will wear it when I need to balance out the gold.",positive
"i really like this ring, great for everyday or dressing up. it is a little thick but the gold looks very real in person. i already got one compliment on it.",positive
"Fits, is wearing well...looks good. Only things I would say is the gold is a little too bright/shiny for me.",positive
"Very pretty. Looks like the real thing. No one has ever asked if its real, they just assume it is and that it's worth a lot!",positive
"I wish I read the actual reviews when I put it on my wish list. Come to find out, you need to ORDER IT IN A LARGE SIZE!Once I purchased a larger size, it is beautiful! Excellent quality and matches well with my wedding rings.",positive
I LOVE this bag/bilfold!  It fits in my compact little purse...but doubles as a purse in itself.  What could be more perfect?,positive
"I was looking for a bag that was small enough that I wouldn't have to carry on my shoulder or would be too heavy (I have a medical condition).  This bag had enough space for all my important credit cards, and a handy one for my driver's license and a mirror next to it.  It has a change compartment in the back, also a compartment for bills and another zippered compartment on the inside.  On top of that, there is space to fit my cell phone, lipstick, nail file, and it could accommodate a couple more items (small though).  It has a small hand strap that pulls out from inside the bag and a long strap if you wanted to use it as a shoulder bag which can easily be taken off.  The leather is quite soft and the bag itself looks quite classy.  The only complaint I would have is that the snap that closes the bag can be hard to close, but it is very secure.  i would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a small bag that accommodates all your important stuff.",positive
"I really like the nude color of this clutch as I can use it with different outfits and colors.The size is perfect for my cell, lipstick, cards and ID. Lots of space in a small bag.",positive
I bought this purse as a backup because I like the pockets and various compartments and don't like to carry a large purse around with me.  I also like that it has a strap that I can put around me and there I go out shopping without worrying about where my purse is,positive
"This is the fifth Buxton of this style I've owned. They are a grab and go item when running errands/shopping. Because I tote my own canvas and insulated shopping bags to the farmers' market and grocery stores, I no longer carry a hand bag/purse. The Buxton clutch is tossed into the shopping bag.As to layout, credit card slots are in perfect location, easy to see and access. I use the checkbook holder for folding money (the little that I carry). There's a zipper compartment for plenty of coin, spare key fob is attached inside, mirror is attached on flap, and there's room for cell phone, lipstick, kleenex, what have you.I have tried other higher end wallets which look good but can't touch the organizational ability of this clutch. I use it  without the easily removable strap.I would be hard pressed to find the quality and convenience at this price anywhere else. I've owned black, beige, brown, navy, and red, and they are all equally attractive (don't look cheesy).",positive
"Great size, can wear under your coat without bulge.  Design deserves five star.  Made from cheap plastic/vinyl material.  Improvement on man made material could be done.",positive
"I had just about given up all hope of finding a replacement for the wallet I have had for more than 15 years.  This one is almost identical to my old one; only the color is different.  It is sleek, functional, well built and even arrived earlier than anticipated.",positive
"My wallet appears  to be a taupe color. The colors I would  have preferred were out of stock. Having said that, there is nothing wrong with the color I got. It isn't fully leather so don't yet know how long it will last. It comes with a check book cover which can be removed. Haven't any cash, so can't tell how happy it would be in the compartments, but my credit card and insurance etc cards seem perfectly happy :). I especially like that the ID view pocket has a hole in the center which makes it much easier to get you DL out when needed.",positive
"I have had my wallet,card/ck book holder/attached coin purse for about 7 years. It is perfect for me. When my Mom saw it she loved it so of course I bought her one as a gift and she loved it. Then about 3 yrs ago her wallet was lost/stolen and she bought herself a different wallet that she didn't really like. Anyway, we all Prayed her wallet would be returned and 8 months later somebody put in in her mailbox!!!! Of course the $ was gone but her personal things were in tack.. Today she said she was looking for a new wallet because hers was a little shabby looking (mine is fine because I do 90% of my shopping ""on-line"" with Amazon. (no wear and tear shopping on line) My Mom said she looked in a few stores and wanted a wallet w/ the change purse attached and hasn't found one yet. Well of course I went on Amazon typed in buxton wallets and in 30 seconds I found our wallet. I called my Mom and just asked what color she wanted.. She said black would be just fine again.. I have just started my Christmas shopping!! Since my Mom doesn't ask for anything it's hard to buy something I know she would like AND use. So, thank you for still having this wallet on the market. I am going to fill up the credit card slots w/ store gift cards for Her. So a $21.00 plus gift turns into a $220.00 when it's opened. I also ordered the key chain/store scan card holder for her. (Mom doesn't keep her scan cards on her key chain so I think she might like it--I ordered it in red so its easy to find) I may just order myself another wallet just to save in case its discontinued... Great organizer/wallet...",positive
"Great item!!! Would recommend to anyone who wants a great wallet, perfect size and color for the money. Would purchase again",positive
"The Buxton Clutch carries the needed items a person must have when entering the world outside the home!  Yep, it carries them all and is easy to carry itself.  For me, there is plenty of room for credit cards, ATM cards, a special place for your driver's license, etc., plus paper money and even a coin purse.What more could you ask for?",positive
"I needed a new one and say this and bought on a wim, But love it, I will buy a new just loke it when it&if ever falls apart!",positive
"Good quality, handy and functional, no bells and whistles just a leather product that works.  I like the coin compartment being on the outside and available without having to open up the whole thing.  I don't like the zipper coin compartments because they don't open wide enough so this is just right.  And the style and color is nice/classy.  It also has a check book holder inside and about 5 credit card slots.  The place designated for your driver's license has a cut-out in the center of the plastic to help get hold of it to take it out when needed which is handy.  It also has a zipper compartment inside to store stuff you want to keep but don't use as much.  Very nice.",positive
"I had to replace my Buxton organizer clutch that I have had for years and years and years. Poor thing was definitely looking dog-eared. I was delighted when I received the new one, and found it was exactly like my old one. No cheapening of the product at all.This is not the fanciest purse organizer that you can buy, nor the most expensive.  But if you want something that just gets the job done, than this is it.  I expect that this will last for years also.Definitely recommended.",positive
"This wallet has already been part of my handbag assembly for a week or so and I coudln't be happier with it-nice construction, design color, texture, and functions great. I'm very satisfied.",positive
"I've only used the Buxton Convertible Billfold  (my last one for over 7 years) as a wallet!  I love the leather and color choices that are available.  You get a great coin pocket with snap closure, insert for your license with removable plastic card pockets with another snap closure, plus your bill compartment. It's a great wallet for a wonderful price!!",positive
"However for me it just doesn't hold enough to be really a piece I'd be able to carry long term. Now we all need so many club cards for stores you to those plus a credit card and drivers license you can barely squish your Health and Car insurance cards it it. Unless you don't have much to carry, I'd say skip it. Buxton, consider making this a little bigger to carry more and its a serious winner. Now if the banks would still make this style of checkbook It would be very convenient.",positive
"My favorite style, by my favorite company!  Buxton really makes nice items that stand the test of time.  I was so happy to see all the colors and styles available. I would not hesitate to purchase item again.",positive
"I think this is a very fashionable wallet. It really does wonders when you want to keep your money in something stylish. I haven't been this impressed with a wallet since theAlicia Klein Wallet ""Park Avenue"". This really is a fantastic wallet to have. I highly recommend getting it.",positive
"This is a very nice wallet.  I purchased this one to replace the exact same wallet.  My old wallet was identical to this but was about 15 years old.  (They do wear out after 15 years of constant use.)  Buxton always makes beautiful quality leather goods.  I like that the change purse closes with a metal clasp and not a zipper.  I especially like that there is a divided change purse --- I use one side for pennies and the other side for all other coins.  Also,  I like that there are two paper money slots ---- I use one side for bills and the other  side for checks.  (yes I am very organized.)  I like this wallet very much.",positive
"I absolutely love this wallet.  I've had it for about 2-3 weeks and its durable and pretty.  It looks exactly like the picture, its got plenty of space.  The only thing I will mention is that in the cash parts, there is an opening, so you can't put loose pieces of paper or anything in there, because it might fall out.  Otherwise its great, there is enough space for a bunch of cards, cash and change.  The wallet can feel a little bulky when completely full but its great.",positive
"I really like this wallet.  It has plenty of room for bank cards and I do not have to fold up the bills when I put them in the wallet.  The only thing that I was originally looking for and this did not have it, was to have my ID in a window outside the wallet so I would not have to open it up in order to show my ID.  Aside from that, it was just what I was looking for.",positive
"First of all I want to say that it is a lovely, well-made wallet. The problem I have is while it has many slots, it doesn't close well when the slots are all or even mostly filled. The change purse clasp pops open and so does the snap closure. I am surprised that no else has reported these issues.",positive
Have used this very same ladies wallet two times. It holds everything you need and hold up really well. Will definitely buy this brand and style again.,positive
"I've been searching unsuccessfully for a few years for a French purse style wallet, as I do not like the long wallets.  This is absolutely PERFECT.  Holds everything and is beautiful to look at.  Buxton has always been an excellent brand, and they continue to produce beautiful and functional accessories.  I am very happy with my purchase.",positive
you can fill fill fill it and it still has room to close and  snap. it is well made  and doesn't smell of leather. It says real leather on cards inside it too!I really like it! perfect size too :)AB,positive
"The wallet has served me well for the short time I have owned it, however, the stitching holding the picture ID window in place has become loose,  is unraveling and is about 30% detached.  It appears the window will become unattached shortly. This unraveling is no doubt a result of having to produce ID several times a week while shopping.  A simple fix would be reinforced stitching in that most used area of the wallet where wear-and-tear are greatest.",positive
"When I was a young lady (am now 90), Buxton was a very good name.  It hasn't changed today, in my estimation, and I am quite pleased with the wallet I purchased.",positive
"this wallet is absolutely perfect!  it holds everything I need, and keeps it all organized.  As for size, I would call it a medium sized wallet, it wouldn't be good for a small purse.",positive
"This is the 2nd time I have purchased this wallet.  I love it!!  It has two places for folding money and a divided coin purse.  It also has many slots for credit cards and other cards you need to keep up with.  It also has a place for your driver's license.  Buxton makes a good, quality product at a very reasonable price.",positive
"This leather wallet is soft leather, holds cash, cards, and change.  It is easy to close and closes tight.  Doesn't take up a lot  of space in your purse.",positive
"Just like all the others, this is the best wallet on the market. Made well and fits all my needs. Who needs a checkbook in the wallert anymore. I just keep the checkbook in a zipper in my purse for the few times I need it. I like the change purse without a zipper. This should last many many years.",positive
I didn't think it was easy to open or that it stored cards and bills well. I sent it back.,positive
"Where do I even begin with how impressed I am with this wallet? It was slightly bigger than I thought it'd be, but when I opened it up, I discovered why - slots GALORE! There are probably 20 card slots alone all over the inside of this wallet, and there are 2 large pockets and perhaps 3-4 small ones for receipts, cash, and whatever else you'd like to store inside your wallet. There is a clasped pouch on one side for your change.Overall, this wallet is extremely well-designed and very useful for those of us who constantly carry a lot of cards with us. The colors are as expected (I got the warm pink shade) and the texture is matte, smooth and durable. Plus, the price is unbeatable! Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and will look into more Buxton wallets in the future.",positive
This wallet is big enough to hold all my credit cards. I also love the two different places you can put your paper money in. Also I love the unique change purse which is divided  pennies on one side and quarters and nickles on the the other side.. Has two clasps on it. One for full wallet and the other one when less is in it. Nice leather on the outside and good man made material on the inside. Will be buying another in  different one as well.,positive
"VERY NICE, I LOVE IT, ALSO GOT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES HERS AS WELL! HOLDING UP GREAT SO FAR!",positive
"after reading all the reviews I was sure this was the wallet for me. It's very low quality leather and doesn't look well-made. It does have many, many card slots, but it seems it would break if they were full. Returned it.",positive
I do not recommend this. Only the outer layer is real leather. They use the cheap fake stuff on the inside. THe wallet smells of cheap plastic. I will not buy this Buxton cheap wallets anymore.,positive
"I wanted a small, but reasonable size wallet to fit in my tiny purse, and came across this in Amazon and knew I had to give it a try. The price and quality makes sense. The pink one looks very classy, although a ltitle bulky, but can't complain...There's many credit card/card compartments and 2 sections where you can put your bills in (I'd say one is more than enough, but it's there).Overall, great purchase.",positive
"I ordered this wallet on a Friday, and I received it the following Tuesday, and it is BEAUTIFUL. I ordered the red one, because red is my favorite color. It is VERY nicely made. Very roomy, has LOTS of places to carry cards etc. The leather is nice and soft to the touch. I think that I am going to be VERY pleased with this wallet for years to come. It also came in a very nice box, so that if anyone were getting it for a gift for someone it would be easy to wrap.",positive
"I have been looking for years in stores for a replacement for my 25 year old wallet.  I am a creature of habit--and do not trade in ANYTHING lightly.  But you can imagine the looks I got with the one I was carrying, beyond old--it was tearing apart, looked terrible--but until I found EXACTLY what I wanted--it was staying.  I just got finished transferring all my life from that to the new Buxton wallet.  Mind you, a wallet to me is a brief history of my life-- where I carry Catholic holy cards, my NRA life-membership card, pictures of my late husband and drivers licenses dating back 15 years.  ALL FIT WITH NO PROBLEM.  I am sorry I did not go on line before last week or I would have found this much sooner.  But EVERYTHING, I mean it ALL fit with no problem.  HIGHLY recommend.",positive
This is the closest thing I have found to a wonderful compact wallet I bought in Italy and used to death. It appears to be well made and I think it will stand up to wear. It has as many pockets and compartments as I need. I appreciate the change purse part that opens up with a snap fastener. Many other wallets have a small gusseted change section that is zippered and doesn't open far enough for you to see what change you have. I wanted something that didn't require me to empty all the coins out to find what I needed.,positive
Trying to downsize my purse contents and this wallet is perfect.  It holds everything that was in my much larger wallet and I love the color.  Buxton has been making quality products for years and they continue to do so.,positive
"I love this wallet. It has a capacity that rivals theAlicia Klein Wallet ""Park Avenue"", and it looks amazing. I think that's all the more reason to give this wallet a try.",positive
"I just ordered this item for my wife as a gift.  She was very happy with this product.  I don't know anything about it, sinceI don't carry one of these.  All I can advise to the customers is, what she said about this product.  She stated that itwas a well known brand, and she liked the soft leather and the well organized compartments in the billfold.  She reallyliked the quality and the full rich color of the leather.She advised that, a product such as this, is hard to find in the department stores locally.  She was very pleased with thelooks and color, and the percise arrangement and the design.  Must be a good one, she is very happy with it.The picture and decription of this item, is right on the money, on the sellers page.............",positive
This was on the list of favorites for my girlfriend.  She just loved it!  It was the right size and color.,positive
"This is a nice wallet until you put a 'few' cards in it.  The card holder inside is made of leather type material and when you add just 8 cards (which includes the drivers license, library card, 2 medical cards, AARP and towing cards-no charge cards) it becomes so bulgy that where it snaps the space is approx 1 1/2 inches apart and will grow if more cards are added.  Sorry to say, I have gone back to my old wallet as this one just does not work out for me.",positive
"I love my new wallet! The color is beautiful and the size is perfect, it is what I was looking for! I am very glad I bought it! Also the seller was great! Thank you so much!",positive
If the inside pocket isn't weighted down it flips upside down.  If it isn't snapped shut in both overlaying flaps everything is all over the ground with the risk of losing cards and IDs.  I even had a nightmare about on my second day of owning this. lol,positive
"I love the length of the strap and they way that the bag is organized.  You just have to be prepared to have everything falling out all of the time.  I taught a class, and one of my students came into my class carrying my debit card saying that I dropped it in the parking lot.  I'm glad someone nice found it.",positive
"There are many things I do love about the purse - the size is perfect. The inside pocket is a nice size. However the upper flap that has slots for your credit cards  is exposed to the outer edge. After using this purse for a couple weeks and taking my debit card in and out, the slot became loose and my debit card slid out into the unknown and was lost. That is a major design flaw. For that reason alone, I cannot give this purse a higher rating.",positive
"has room for what you need to run out of the house, only thing wish the handle was made a little stronger, but overall size is great",positive
I bought this purse because I don't like carrying around a large purse but I need a lot of pockets for all my stuff.  This fit the bill perfectly.  It's large enough yet large enough to hold what I need,positive
Actually this bag is made great but it has twice as many places to put cards as I need. I bought it so I would always have a small black bag and now I do mission accomplished.,positive
"This purse is very likeable.  It's a handy, small size and the leather is quite soft to touch.  The drawback is that the gap at the top when the purse is clasped is so large little items may fall out.  With the price of lipstick these days, I won't chance carrying it loose in this purse!  I did keep the purse, though, thinking I can use it for special occasions when it suits my outfit.  On those occasions, I plan to put the smaller items in a cosmetic bag and carry that inside the purse.",positive
"I bought this same wallet last year for myself. My mom liked it so much that I ordered one for her as well.  We are both very happy with them.  I carry a Nokia 1520 cell phone and it fits perfectly, even with my checkbook. So easy to stay organized with all the pockets. Its held up pretty well too, and I'm not overly careful.  I would definitely recommend this.",positive
I love this bag as an option to switch to a smaller carry option.  The only problem I had was the snap closure is tight and actually pulled out from the bag when I tried harder to open it.  I've pushed it back in but don't use it much because of this.,positive
I bought 4 shoulder wallets.  This one is the most organized.  The color is not a bright red so it has a soft red color.,positive
"I started trying out a red one, then a blue one and the latest is a white one.  They look small but it is amazing how much stuff you can carry in these little buggers without them looking stuffed.  They are great and I'm very happy with them!",positive
"hoping to use it as large clutch wallet. it's too big for that but too small for a purse for me, an adult woman. It's nicely made so I'm hoping to use it as a gift for a younger girl..",positive
"I wanted a burgundy to match a tote bag I have, but this is a little too dark. The style is nice, though, with lots of room for the amount of stuff I carry. I wish the credit card slots were enclosed within the pouch of the bag for more security. I ordered a credit card stacker to play it safe. Overall, it's a nice mini bag for carrying cash,cards and my smartphone.05/05: Today I tried to open the inner flap and the clasp was stuck fast and I ended up tearing it. Too bad because the red one I have is still doing fine with normal wear.",positive
As with any Buxton product this is a fine quality leather clutch. Bought it for my wife and she loves it. Tastefully designed and nice and roomy with plenty of dividers and zippered pockets etc.,positive
Buxton is my go-to for wallets. They have so many compartments that are perfect for all the things you need/want to carry in your wallet. This taupe color is very pretty & goes with any handbag I carry. Buxton is always a great product!,positive
This is one of my favorite orders from Amazon and it a great wallet and high quality.  I will look for a purse to match.,positive
"Great wallet, plenty of room for cards, and anything you need in your wallet, holds checkbook and register, only thing can not pull them out.  Very well made leather on outside very soft, pretty sure wallet will last a long time",positive
"The check holder I received with this clutch was not removable, thus limiting its use for me, since my husband and I share the checks.  I returned it to Amazon, a company that is the most cooperative I deal with.",positive
This is the best wallet I have ever bought and I am a purse and wallet freak.  Look good and fits all.,positive
Beautifully made with high quality materials.  Very nice and at a low price.  It had many more pockets and compartments than were apparent from the pictures and descriptions.  Am thinking of getting another one as a spare.,positive
"My sister and I purchased this clutch and we both love it.  The features are great and the clutch color is so rich looking,  I would highly recommend....in any color.",positive
I love this billfold! It is large & has many compartments and slots. I love the zip around closure as well.,positive
"I always come back to Buxton for wallets.  This one has a place for everything, and I do mean everything!  I really like the currency compartment--there are two slots for bills and a center zippered compartment for coins, receipts, or large denominations.  There's also a change pouch in front for easy access.  There are almost enough card slots, and there are a number of plastic sleeves if you run out of slots.  For some reason the slots are not of uniform size and I had to do some finagling to make some of my cards fit.  I also wish the snap flap went over the currency compartment so I didn't have to keep it zipped, but I'll get used to it, and I'm sure the leather slots will loosen up with use.After an exhaustive online and in store search, I've decided that this clutch gives the best bang for the buck.  Mine is red, and it's a rich, not fire engine color.  I'm very pleased.",positive
"This clutch wallet passed my expectations, very happy with this wallet.  The color and suede feel is a great plus. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great clutch wallet at a reasonable price.  In similar products, other clutch book wallets would not have as much available space, for all items needed to be placed in the wallet.  The size can fit into any pocketbook without the bulge when filled, a deep pocket, or used as a carry-along without pocketbook.  This clutch is great, and would not be a disappointment to anyone who is looking for this type of wallet.  I Love It!!!",positive
"I originally ordered three wallets.  This was the one I initially liked the best, but the one of the zippered compartments was too small for dollar bills, and the zipper would separate when zipped.  I sent it back and kept the Visconti Heritage T-35.",positive
To me it appears almost brown rather than mahogany. It is well made and functional and the price is quite good.,positive
This is a wallet every woman should own. I can put everything I had in my previous wallet and much more that I can add to this new wallet. It is leather. I would order it again.,positive
This is very pretty and the leather is very soft.  It is going to be a great gift for someone special!,positive
"I'm really impressed with this clutch. It make for a wonderful alternative for something lie theAlicia Klein Wallet ""Park Avenue"". It's easy to carry around and it can handle anything a wallet to best of its ability. I think it's a terrific item to have.",positive
I think this is such a great wallet! Fit everything I needed it to! Great color! Love the leather! Matches my new bag perfectly,positive
"I was shock on the price of this clutch and what quality I received .  Excellence can only describe how pretty and soft the leather is .  I have so much pain in my hands , soft leather is a treat to me.",positive
"I have had several zip around clutch wallets and it is the style I prefer.  The color is not fire engine red just a nice red color.  The leather is medium soft with a nice feel to it.  Love all the card holding spots and the area for a check book is easily used for something else. The snap closure is handy and keeps everything in place, you can access your money without having to open the clutch,  just  open the zippered area. Having a zipper change pocket on the side is so handy or you can use the zipper pocket in the zip around.  When all filled I still found this Buxton clutch to be fairly slim.  I'm very pleased with this clutch and would buy it again.",positive
"These don't give me much support but I did not really expect them to. I wear a 32D and ordered a size C they covered perfectly. I feel like this may work better if you are fuller on top. I'm fuller on bottom and the tabs just pull the skin and makes me look wrinkly. They did give me some support, however they also made a strange cone shape and made me look quite pointy. I would wear these with something that already has some support or is a thicker fabric. However, they will definitely come in handy with certain outfits and would be perfect for a special occasion dress that already has some structure.",positive
"I am a 34 C. You have to play with them at first to get the look you want, but once you do, they are awesome. They look like I have perky boobs with no bra. Be patient though. Also, they may not work so well with thin fabrics. . . makes the skin look kind of wrinkly.",positive
"You do have to trim them with a scissor to make them a suitable size for your own body shape and the clothing you are wearing them with.  They provide just enough lift, but don't expect them to make you look like you're wearing a full bra.  They just reduce the jiggle and hold you in place.",positive
These definitely take practice to apply without leaving wrinkles.  We had to cut this to size so nothing peeks out.  Got lucky as it worked the first time!,positive
"Large chest women cannot wear theses.You know how difficult it is to tape things, just imagine your boobs.I had to try for only $10. I wrote the review so you don't have too.And I only intended to wear these with a strapless bra for more support, not alone so I was not expecting too much.",positive
"I wear a 40DD but got the 40DDD instead since it was my first time ordering bras from Amazon. The fit would have been ideal if it wasn't padded. Women who already have large enough 'girls' do not need the padding. The bra looks perfect online, however, the workmanship left much to be desired. For example, the black lace  flowers design that covers the beige material needed some more attention to be paid to it. While the flowers were pretty, each flower bud and petal had thread sticking out (the flowers are sewn on). All the manufacturers had to do was just clip off the extra pieces of thread. I plan to do just that.",positive
"this bra is really comfy and supportive. the only downside i have is that it actually rides a little high, so you can't wear it with lower cut tops or it will show.",positive
"This bra is one of the most comfortable garments I've purchased in a very long time.  It provides the support I want while being comfortable and quite pretty also.  I have been purchasing bras at a much higher price, they were excellent; however, at this price and the satisfaction with the garment I'll be happy to purchase this item again.",positive
This bra fits properly and is beautiful.  It's nice to find a pretty bra in larger sizes.  Most of the pretty one stop at size 40.,positive
I love this bra. doesnt ride under arm or didn't even need any adjusting. Plan to buy a few more soon,positive
"I ordered the black one first and was so pleased with it that I ordered the navy one.  Love the satin finish on the back.  VERY comfortable with GREAT support and coverage.  If the rating went to 10 stars, I'd try to give 11. :-)",positive
"Love, love, love this bra.  It fits well, the underwire doesn't poke into my arm, and the bra cup stays put.  I wear it all day long and it is still comfortable at the end of the day.  I usually get home from work thinking ""I can't WAIT to get this bra off.""  Not with this one.  It's pretty and it fits and it's very comfortable.",positive
"This bra fits perfect and I bought it to go with my blue dress. It looks so sexy to, love it",positive
"Lovely, fits, and the lace pattern is gorgeous. Only 4 stars because I had to bend the underwire in the middle to make it not poke me in the underarm.",positive
"The bra is certainly not one you want to wear out to the club or for good cleavage. It's incredibly comfortable and one of my favorite bras for lazy days. However, if you want to show the girls off, I suggest something else.",positive
This bra quickly became my favorite. I wear it practically every day. It's so comfortable and seamless! I can wear thin shirts and there are no bra-lines showing. Love it.,positive
"The bra fits well but the cups are far larger than desired.  Your boobs won't just flop around, they'll look freaky.",positive
This was a gift. This was excelent and  like it. Playtex is good. They arrived on time and has the quality and desing that amazons offers.,positive
"It is everything as described, however, for me that bra did not cover everything as I expected. Pretty, comfortable. Can also be used as a one size up pusher bra because it is thick enough, but it is not thick thick. I recommend it. My girlfriend liked it too.",positive
"This bra is incredibly comfortable, and at least for me, it is true to size.  I am deployed in Afghanistan, so I do not have the luxury of trying items on before I buy, therefore, I am very impressed with the fit and will be ordering more of this exact bra, but in different colors.  The shoulder straps are a perfect width - not too thick or thin. And the back strap is a good width for support and keeps ""bra muffin top"" away :)",positive
The bra is nice but I didnt like it because it gives your boobs that old school pointy look and I have never liked that.,positive
this is a great bra. it was so soft and comfortable I really like it. I will be buying more in the future and do recommend it toothers.,positive
"I purchased this slip in a dept store many years ago, & it has stood the test of time very well. Now, it is nowhere to be found locally. But trusty ol' Amazon has it! Yay! Ordered 2. Black & neutral. So happy to find this item. Ordered by my bust size. Perfect fit!",positive
Washes and dries well in the dryer. Stays true to fit and keeps its shape wash after wash. This is the best lace full slip. I will be ordering another one.,positive
This slip is going to work great under a light colored summer dress.  Slip is the perfect length for the dress and fits just as expected.,positive
"My Mother has difficulties getting out to shop. We found this, knew the brand was a good brand, ordered it and it was just what she wanted.",positive
Probably my fault but this was way shorter than I expected.  I kept it because I'm sure I can use it in the future but I need to order a longer one.,positive
Really like this slip but it runs smaller than my size. I even ordered a size larger than I normally wear. The slip &#34;clings&#34; to your body but does not seem to ride up when wearing. I would definitely buy again but will purchase two sizes larger next time.,positive
The fit was good ITS A SLIP WHAT CAN YOU SAY  THE ITEM ARRIVED AFTER I NEEDED BUT THAT WAS FINE,positive
"This is a very nice, well made slip.  I plan to order one in a longer version.  Sometimes I want the ease of a full slip under my dresses/skirts.  I would recommend this.  The slip arrived within a couple of days of my order which surprised and pleased me.  I got it just when I needed it.",positive
"Because this item was so inexpensive, I was not expecting much. To my surprise, it was of decent quality. It's not a luxury item by any means, but it works fine for my purposes. I'm 5' and weigh about 110lbs, with a 34D bra size. I ordered the small, and it fit me quite well.",positive
"This slip was the most economical I could find online. I rarely need a full slip so I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. It's comfortable, cool (that was my biggest thing), and fits well. The straps do tend to fall down a little bit but you could easily stitch them in place. I don't see this lasting 20 years like my mom's Vanity Fair slip, but I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend it!",positive
I ordered this slip using Amazon Prime 2 day free shipping and received it one day early.  The package was in excellent shape. I am very happy with Amazon Prime delivery.The slip was exactly what I wanted the nylon material feels very good next to my skin and the lace adds a very nice touch to this slip.  The fit is excellent and the length was just what I expected.  I will be ordering more of these in different lengths and also in black.  I wish there were more color options than just black and white.  I have purchased other Vanity Fair slips and have not been disappointed with any of them.,positive
My second time purchasing this item. I wear it under dresses as a slip is supposed to be worn and it does the job perfectly. I can't believe how hard slips are to find and this one is perfect for the job.,positive
"I recently bought several wrap and faux-wrap dresses that could show off WAY too much leg if there's a slight breeze, so I needed something a bit modest to spare the world a view of my blindingly white legs. This slip works PERFECTLY. It's beautiful and comfortable. It also makes me feel a bit like a '40s film star. Women need to dress like this more often!The fit: I ordered my bra size. I've got that lovely pear shape going, and it still fit perfectly over my hips. I'd order more colors (I got the black), but they're all out of stock! Bummer.",positive
"This slip is awesome, I love in particular how it fits across my chest. I love the fabric, I love the length and it came very promptly in the mail. It's a nice slip to have for a nightgown or for any other occasion. Defintely recommend this buy :)",positive
"i am 5'3 and this slip is right in the middle of my knee and very long. it was cheap so i'm keeping it, but the length will limit me from wearing this often with most of my dresses that are right above the knee level.",positive
This slip is exactly what I was looking for. Traditional styling that you don't see much of anymore. The only drawback is the length is too long and not adjustable. I bought what I thought was a shorter length and it wasn't.,positive
It fits really well.  It stays where in place. It's not bulky at all. Hidden under my dress and is actually kind of comfy.,positive
"The slip arrived on time and was just as I expected.  It fits true to size.  I wanted to wear it under a dress that exposes the top part of the slip, but it just looks too much like a slip.  I will definitely use it as a slip, but I want to try and get something else for under this totally sheer dress.  I tried wearing a camisole, but it didn't work at all with this dress,",positive
This is a wonderful slip.  The fit is perfect and exactly to specified measurements.  Excellent value!,positive
"These are great. They go on how they should and they stay the whole day. I'm pretty sure they'd stay a whole week if I wanted them to. They're very cute too! One note -- if the fabric you're wearing is white or somewhat sheer, you might want to buy tan petals instead, as the pink is very light and will show through as a white bra would.",positive
"I am wearing a wire bra in a parade and don't want any wardrobe malfunctions. After buying two other more expensive pairs, one too light (who would have thought that Jennifer Lopez was considered &#34;dark&#34;) and one whose reviewers swore it was adhesive and it wasn't , I finally found these again and they arrived quickly .  I'm SO pleased!!!!!",positive
"That I sweat a lot and my skin pores were itching, I have a problem with my skin breathing, how ever they did not come off.....I did end up having a nice irritated skin.",positive
"These work very well. Love the color and the feel. Stick on very smooth and can't see under clothing unless it's a light colored thin shirt. Best I've found for the price. Very easy on the skin and easy to take off, no pain at all, and stay on all day long. Middles sometimes tend to puff out if sitting or laying a certain way but go back when standing up. Great for the price and no pain when removing!",positive
"These fit wonderfully, very indiscreet, and I didnt feel them at all. There was no pull when taking them off. Very nice, I would buy again.",positive
"I made a Halloween costume, but it soon became apparent that the inside wasn't padded well enough... Ordered these pretty much last-minute, got them the day of the party, and I must say that they certainly did their job! I couldn't even tell I was wearing them, either. After the party, I ended up falling asleep with them on, and even then when I went to take them off the next day, it didn't hurt at all. It pulled just a tiny bit, like pulling off one of those cheap bandaids with really weak adhesive. Also, they hadn't come off at all during the night, and I toss and turn a lot when I sleep, so they seem to last well.I was wearing something with a little bit of padding, so I can't speak for how well they will do underneath something very thin, like whether or not the edges will show.",positive
"When looking for a solid pair of pantyhose I look no further than Berkshire Silky. These are high quality and durable. I love the little extra shine on them, it adds a lot of class.I also love all of the colour options. They have a lot of types of nudes that are wonderful. I have every colour and love them all.I would recommend these to anyone looking for an awesome pair of nylons.",positive
"These do not bind or roll, perfect for dressing up or wearing to an office. I will buy these again!",positive
"I am so happy with these... they feel great and very sturdy.  The sizing chart was accurate... I am 5'6/200 and I ordered 1x/2x which fit fine.  The control top is very comfortable compared to other brands.  The fabric is very smooth, not too flimsy but not suffocatingly thick either. It also is not snagging like other nylons, nor do I notice any pilling.  They are so comfortable, and I expect to get many more wears out of these.  I am so impressed with these I just bought 2 more pairs.",positive
These held up to me very well.  I wore them 3 or 4 times before I ripped them.  I 'm kind of rough with hosiery.,positive
"The product was large, but I am glad I purchased them , they are very roomy indeed. Great Price and I will order again.",positive
"these are the most durable ph i have ever bought, they come in aarray of colors ultra sheer to opaque, designs.. something for everywomen in you",positive
These fit nicely and are very comfortable. Great product and excellent value. What else can be said about pantyhose?? They fit and stay put,positive
have not worn them yet but i like the color and if they fit like the ones i had before they will fit quite well,positive
"I hate panty hose. I bought these because for my size I was told this was the best brand. They fit fine, didn't ride up or roll down, and didn't bunch up around the legs. Won't plan on wearing again but it's good enough for the one time I needed them.",positive
"Sure it fits snug - but that's what it is supposed to do! Also, the garters are wonderful, only one has ripped, but it is easily sewn back together. It makes everything smooth underneath clothes, and is just a fun thing to wear! It has a lot of stretch to it, so that's good for me; I recommend for any lady pursuing the glamour of the 1950s!",positive
"This is my second garter from Rago and it's amazing. If you're looking for shapewear, this is the brand you want. Don't bother with Spanx, they're not gonna hold you in. They'll smooth all the lines, but this one will give you the firmed up, 1950s look. I work at a 1950s clothing shop and I'm not the only girl who wears Rago!Also, I'm a petite girl and Rago has sizes for me. Shapewear in smaller sizes can be difficult to come across.Anyway, Rago is an amazing brand, please don't hesitate to get something from them. &#60;3",positive
Very sexy and gives nice finished look under your favorite retro dress. I love it. Pulls in without rolling down at the waist or hiking up.  Nicely made.,positive
"Purchased this to wear under a formal dress for a wedding.  The control and slimming aspects are outstanding; really made my dress hang well.  Unfortunately, every time I sat down, the bottom would ride up so once I stood again I would need to slip into the ladies' room to pull it back down.  I avoided anything with a seat because it becomes so cumbersome to go to the bathroom and thought this would be a good alternative but it was not.  I would buy a Ragu product again just not this style.",positive
"I wear a rago 1359 obg every day. with it on I have a flat tummy again. Wearing a girdle does meanwearing panties under (Vanity Fair Nylon Rivissant) - to help put it on and stockings (Berkshire It Fits)toprevent ride up. Dressing in the morning takes a bit of time but my girdle does stays in place. At first it is tight, then comfortable, and then I forget that I have it on. I do not have that girdled look and I really dolook better with my girdle on.",positive
I thought the hooks were too small for my bra straps- but a kind commenter helped me out. I now realize they wrap around the bra strap and hook to themselves. So now that I know how to use the strap it works well but is not super comfortable. I'd recommend it still though because it beats having your straps fall down.,positive
"For $7 you get 4 of these things - what more can you ask? I bought these as opposed to buying new racerback bras. They are certainly tricky to install - probably best if you ask a friend for help. BUT once in place, they work really well to keep your straps in place, and if you have a top or dress that dips in a little as I do, they are great for helping to hide your straps! The beige color is more of an ivory than a nude, which was my only disappointment. But glad I got them!",positive
"This is a great idea, but they are very hard to put on by yourself, and they pop off real easily.",positive
"This strap gets the job done, but the clasps come undone very easily for me.  And if I do get my bra on without the clasps coming undone, I usually have to do some super-secret-acrobatic trick maneuvers to move the strap to the position I would like it to be.  But honestly, a great solution for a common problem, to that I say &#34;Kudos!&#34;",positive
"So, I love the idea here, but there are some considerations. First, the S/M is more for training bras or people who are very small/petite. So, I wish they would just call it Small rather than S/M. I think most women would need the Large/XL, even though it sounds big, I think it suit more people.Second, the right fit is important because if it's too tight, the part that grabs the back of your bra straps starts to cinch the strap, so you have two, tiny bunches by your shoulder blades that stick out like little bumps on your back.Finally, the clips do slip once in a while, so there is a chance they'll come undone. Then you'll have a swinging strap on your back.Again, I like the idea here, and it's better more often than not. But it's not as revolutionary as I thought it would be. :)  I'm still waiting for a better solution.",positive
"I was somewhat skeptical about these straps and I have to admit that it took me a few minutes to figure out how to attach them to my bra, even after looking at the picture on the package. They work GREAT!!!! I gave the clear strap to one of my co-workers to try out and she loves them too. The only drawback is that you have to keep it attached and put your bra on over your head and hook your bra from behind. BUT, if it keeps my bra straps up all day long I will do anything!!!!!!! I am very happy with the product and I ordered the L/XL variety pack with 4 different colored straps. I wear a size 34-B bra so I would expect that unless you are a size 0 that most women would need the L/XL size.",positive
A perfect fit for grandmother to wear daily. Easy to wash and dry and fabric was comfortable for daily wear,positive
"This night gown is very pretty and a nice clear shade of red. It is comfy in terms of fit but  the fabric makes it clingy and warm specially on a humid night. I was hoping for a breezy, cool nightgown and should have paid more attention to the description of the fabric",positive
I have been buying Shadowline night gowns for years. They took the place of the Vanity Fair ones I use to be able to find. With this recent purchase I noticed that the fabric IS a lighter weight compared to my other Shadlowline gowns. Maybe the company is trying to cut down on their cost and therefore using lighter weight fabric. Either way I love the color and am happy with it. If they go any lighter in the fabric weight I will NOT buy anymore.,positive
"Great gown and the material is wonderful. Bought the red and petal pink. Red bold, pink deep. These are quality. Little long bare foot, but perfect length in slippers. 5'3&#34; Will come back and purchase other colors and from this company bought darker colors due to not wanting to be sheer looking in the light. These are what I wanted. Wash delicate HE machine and use Tyler detergent. Hang to air dry. Then quick fluff in air HE dryer. Wonderfull in feel and fragrance.",positive
This gown is very well made and great weight.  I have other Shadowline gowns and they wash well and color stays true. I would recommend this product to others.,positive
"A little too transparent.  Not so bad that I can't wear it.  Pretty color.  Size seems true.  Mine was ""soft peach"".  A nice color.",positive
I was amazed at the quality of this night gown. The nylon was not the thin flimsy material that you usually see but a nice weight that should hold up well. It washed up beautifully and came out of the dryer wrinkle free . The fit was very accurate and the length was just right . I'm 5ft 3inch and it was perfect! I plan to order other colors and these usually sell for much more!,positive
I was happy to see this style of gown that is almost impossible to find in a store.  I had several that were identical to this made by Vanity Fair years ago.  They were the best gowns ever.  This one by Shadowline is a close second.  It's comfortable and lasts a few years before fading.  I have the sapphire color which is not see-through.  The lighter colors are see-through.  It's made in Mexico.,positive
Love the color and this gown washes so nicely.  Nice and long to give that extra warmth and keeps the shape really nice too.,positive
"Love this beautiful nightgown.  I was looking for a pretty but practical peignoir set which is surprisingly hard to find, and I settled on this nightgown with the matching robe.  I am 5'7&#34; 150 lbs and wasn't sure whether to get the medium or large.  I played it safe and went for the large, but its a bit big and I think the medium would have fit well, at least for the nightgown.  I would probably still choose the large robe. The rosy pink is a beautiful deep pink, the gown is the perfect weight for wearing and feels wonderful on.  I knock off a star however because as others have mentioned, it is too sheer to wear without the robe, at least for me. I plan to order the short set for summer wear.  Maybe several!",positive
All the Shadowline products I have purchased fit perfect and the gown or robes have been well made.  I would buy Shadowline products again.,positive
Very elegant looking gown.  Fits nicely.  Washed up very well.  Packed well for travel.  Would definitely purchase this gown again.,positive
"I bought this for my elder mother, who wanted a LONG nightgown. Turns out it was a little too long for her :-)  and I hand hemmed it. Not a big deal. she is very particular about the length of her gowns. Quite a pretty gown, nice color, nice neckline and coverage....only wish the fabric was not so thin!",positive
"This gown is generous in fit, soft, washes up beautifully and comes out of the dryer with no wrinkles and packs easily. I would suggest going down one size if you are between 1x and 2x. The color is exactly the way the photo shows and is a deep hot pink color.  I bought the matching robe as well and the same can be said about it as the nightgown.  I do not find it cool to sleep in, as other reviewers mentioned, but it is certainly comfortable and pretty enough to wear it around the house and especially when visiting friends and you want something to throw on quickly to make those bathroom trips in the middle of the night! The style is rather matronly, and is  suitable for mixed company or when you need something simple to wear while getting coffee in the morning.",positive
"surprisingly warm and soft feeling.  Beautiful, good price, an excellent buy for anyone to enjoy.  I love it anytime, any place.",positive
I have bought Shadowline long gowns for several years. I love the colorsthey are so comfortable and last for a long time. Own almost all the colors.THEY ARE WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL,positive
"Having previously purchased a Shadowline long gown in 2002....I was in desperate need of a new one...with red being my favorite of colors, this was a no brainer.  A red Shadowline...hands down!My previous purchase was from a local upscale dept store and through the years it has seen it's share of some rips and tears; however it is still together, just a lot of wearing, but I will not part with it even though it has now been retired.I'm so glad this item was available...and will be a continued customer of Shadowline (until maybe I have every color) and Amazon...amazing service ~",positive
I like to put this on when I get up as a coverup when I make breakfast.  Pretty looking gown.,positive
"Since a few customers have commented that the quality has changed- and I have NOT found this to be the case, I want to include some information from a comment by one of the sellers.  It will be after my own review.  I have worn these gowns for more than 20 years.  I used to purchase them at Dillard's Dept. Stores, but they quit selling them some years ago.  I was so happy to find them available here on Amazon because absolutely NOTHING I have found, for any amount of money, has been as nice as the Shadowline.  The pale pink, peach, and periwinkle are not quite as opaque as the other colors but I do not find anything unusual about that (think white pants!).  If you find the darker colors to be too revealing, you should probably consider flannel nightgowns. Just saying. :-)___________________Shoppers please note: There was a short period of time (late 2011) when Shadowline used a different fabric for the Petals gowns in Holly Red and Deep Lavender. It was not as nice as their traditional Opacitrique fabric. When they changed this in 2012 (and changed the color names to Red and Purple), the listings got mixed up here and were combined into the same page (for Purple and Deep Lavender). ALL of the new Petals gowns are made from the same fabric now, which is their trademarked Opacitrique fabric--the original Shadowline Petals fabric. The new owner is extremely picky about the quality of his products. And I believe the Deep Lavender and Purple are now the same gowns. If you have doubts, it is a simple matter to contact the seller of whichever size & color you are viewing and ask them whether it is Opacitrique fabric: select a size and color, then click on the seller's name that shows up. On the right side of the page, scroll down to the link that says Contact Seller. Hope this helps!",positive
"I bought this for my Daughter in Law for Christmas.  She has worn Shadowline gowns for several years and appreciates that the fabric is heavy enough that she can go around the house with the young children with out worrying about having to put on a robe first.  The gowns are comfortable as well as durable.  Had difficulty finding them for the past year or so and understand the company has changed hands, but these gowns appear to be equal in quality as the older ones she has.",positive
"Just like the green one I ordered earlier, fits great.  Good weight, decent for walking the house, but feminine.  I love Shadowline ANYTHING.",positive
the color is as beautiful as in the picture and very very comfortable.  fast shipment also.  worth the money spent,positive
"I love the Shadowline nightgowns because they're comfortable & the fabric is usually thicker than similar nightgowns by other manufacturers -- the only complaint I have about this one is that the fabric is lighter weight in this rich purple color -- the lighter colors use the thicker fabric and they should've used the same fabric for the purple -- the lighter the nylon fabric is, the more static-prone they are -- not so terrible, but an issue nonetheless.",positive
"Well made with opaque fabric of a good weight. Past reviews extolling the fabric convinced me, and the design is attractive. If it came in another color in my size, I'd buy it.",positive
The gown flows beautifully.  Very comfortable with no itchy seams or tags.  Elegant and worth the money  I highly recommend this item..,positive
By accident I purchased my first Shadowline gown back in 1995.  Have been buying them ever since.  They are the best gowns.  Material is soft...and wears like iron.  The length is perfect.  I love my gowns long.....not ankle length.  I am 5'6&#34; and the gown brushes the top of my foot.  This gown is worth the money.,positive
"I have a 96 year old Mother who still wears girdles with garters.  Therefore, I could not find any &#34;standalone&#34; stockings at all; Everything is now a pantyhose.  I tried these stockings first to see if I could get a color match and size.  She loved them, so I ordered more.",positive
they fit really good and they feel fantastic on my legs. love wearing them..will buy more. they make my legs feel sexy,positive
Bought these for my girlfriend.  They are not her choice but she wears them for me.  Definitely a long of fun compared to panty hose.  I don't think you will find a better bang for your buck.  Don't forget the garter belt!,positive
"I am 5'6&#34;, 130 lbs, and I opted for the shorter stockings.  I'm glad I did, as the larger size would've been WAY too long.  These have a nice feel to them, and although I've only worn them once, they seem as though they'll last a while.  I'm happy with the purchase.",positive
"I find &#34;control top&#34; pantyhose very uncomfortable.  Thigh-highs are the best solution, and these are reasonably priced.  I ordered one size up as I have large sized thighs (I am &#34;pear shaped&#34;).  The color, &#34;nude,&#34; is a bit whitish for my needs.  I have medium color caucasian-type skin.",positive
These are really ice hose. I am short and plump and they fit great. They are actually true to size.,positive
"Most thigh highs seem a bit short for my big legs, but these are perfect for me.",positive
The stockings are excellent quality and I am very pleased with them and will probably buy more in the future.,positive
"I've always liked Berkshire hosiery and these thigh highs are good. I ordered queen size but my thighs are small so they were a little big, but I could still wear them and they did not fall.",positive
Well I guess thy r ok but the stockings had a run in them after only 1 use and the skin under where the rubbery part is that holds them up was really sore after wearing them so um I'm not going to so I guess the run in them dues not really matter just if u have sensitive skin u may want to not get those.,positive
"Great my girlfriend loves these and enjoyed them for work, very professional and classy she gets complements at her work.",positive
SURPRISINGLY THESE STOCKINGS ARE WONDERFUL !MY Lady loves the way they feel on and they actually stay up on her Big ThighsWOOO !  HOOO !,positive
This bra fits true to size and is comfortable.  I was able to find this via the id number on the tag of my old bra.  Thank you Amazon for making searching for items easy and having a better price!,positive
"I am a solid 32DDD. I've been measured and that is the size of bra I wear in brands across the board. This bra has this weird extra nipple room that I did not need. I'd probably be able to fit a tablespoon in there and fill lit perfectly. It isn't that the cup is too big, it's only this extra nipple space. The bra is also scratchy. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and wash it a few times before I go to put it on again. I cannot wear it with t shirts or thin dresses because of this extra nipple room, and because it does create sort of a torpedo effect. I wouldn't compare it to the torpedo boobs you'd see on Marilyn Monroe and the likes, but it definitely does give a point to the breasts. I will only be able to wear this bra with clothing that is thicker, like sweaters, or dresses that are double layered or have thick material. I also ordered Wacoal La Femme Contour Bra. This bra is AMAZING. The Bali Bra in my size has 4 hooks and very large straps also, the cups go very high on the breast, covering almost the entire breast, making it illogical to wear with anything that shows even a little chest (not breast) because the bra is visible. The Wacoal bra is unbelievably comfortable and only a tad bit more in price.",positive
I normally wear a 42 B but I had to buy a C in this. It fit but man is it scratchy material!,positive
"Although the cups of my 32D fit, the back measurment is not right.  The bra will only fit around my back in the very last hook, which means that when the back stretches, the bra becomes useless because there's no where to go with the hooks.  It should have been made to fit on the very first hooks, so that I could always move in if I needed to.",positive
"I'm wearing this bra as I type this rating.  It fits very well, and is extremely comfortable to wear.  I disagree with some of the other reviews that say this bra is &#34;scratchy&#34; - not at all!  Very smooth feeling and well made.  I will purchase more.",positive
"Been wearing this bra for many years, recently lost weight but cant wear a C cup.Looks great, that is what you expect from Bali",positive
"Great bra for the money, I just wish there where more colors to choose from for my size. Its great.",positive
"I have to start out by saying, I thought this was the brand of bra I have been wearing for the last 8 years, (it looks exactly like what I wear) I didn't realize mine is a different brand until after I placed my order.. I am Sooo Happy I did order this Bali!! The fit (for me) is perfect!! It stays in place, the back is &#34;U&#34; shaped so I don't have to keep adjusting it through out the day!! It has GREAT SUPPORT, (I'm 64 yrs. old, 5' 5&#34;, 137lbs). I purchased a few T-shirts at the beginning of summer, little did I know how clingy they would be (I almost sent them back) with this Bali Bra however, I look great in those T's!!! I LOVE &#34;This Bali&#34; Soooo Much Better than my brand!!! I LOVE the U shaped back, I love the support, I love the comfort, and I Love the way I Look with this Bali Bra!!! I can't wait to buy more!!! Thank You Amazon and Under Moments!!!",positive
"I've purchased this bra for many years. It is never my only purchase. I use this bra for specific purpose in specific garments when I was to have a true shelf type bra that hold your breasts up and out. Wearing blouses or dressed, or even casual tank tops, can make the breasts look droopy and thereby making you stomach area look thicker, and your torso shorter.  With this bra, the band does most of the work holding up the breasts so that the stress is not felt exclusively at the shoulder straps. No the straps are no elastic and it isn't due to being cheap. the do the job of holding the breasts in perfect place and they have soft fabric under the strap which makes them very comfortable. The only discomfort you should feel is you choose the wrong size because they don't have a lot of &#34;give.&#34; They wear like iron and look great through many washes. I recommend never putting any bra through a dryer, nor using any fabric softener or high sudsing detergents that destroy the elastic. (sulfates causes sudsing) Try Charlie's Soap. You can purchase it through Earth Fare.  You will never regret it and it keeps the washer clean as a whistle, even the moving parts. What I also like about this bra is that there is no side breast because of the wonderful &#34;stays&#34; on either side of the bra. These push you side tissues towards the front. Just own it and throw your shoulders back and look great even if you aren't used to looking so good. You will be glad not to bounce all around if that is an issue for you i other bras. Don't let the less expensive price break distract you from getting this bra.  Inexpensive doesn't mean it is &#34;cheaply made.&#34; Remember to lean fully forward while making the connections so you distribute tissue. Enjoy this purchase. Cindy T. God Bless",positive
"Very nice bra, but the material is a bit stiff, which keeps the girls where they're supposed to be, though. It'll give a pointy shape, which is not very flattering with regular t-shirts, but will add some lift with ""flowy"" tops.BE AWARE: even though it says that this item qualifies for free returns, you will have to pay for the shipping costs if you want to return this bra!!! Amazon customer rep told me it's because the product is not sold/fulfilled by Amazon itself, but by a 3rd party. It puzzles me why Amazon mentions free returns on the product page when it doesn't apply  to that specific product. On a product that doesn't cost much, having to pay for return shipping is quite a waste.",positive
Great fit and super comfortable. Never rides up my back and wide padded shoulder straps are great. Plan on buying several more!,positive
"great support for running, I have worn this ugly bra for 20 years, it has the best support and comfort.",positive
"I was looking for a casual bra to wear when I worked in the yard and chose this one based on reviews and price.  It's going back.The bra is thin with old fashioned pointed nipples.  The material fails to stretch to adapt to breast dimensions, causing some areas to be too tight and others too loose.  It felt uncomfortable (not too tight - just too rough) as soon as I put it on.Because it's a Bali, it's probably durable and would hold up over time better than cheaper bras but I just can't get over the positive reviews so I'm giving it only one star.For a better fitting and much more comfortable bra, try a Victoria's Secrets wireless cotton bra.  It gives you the smooth coverage you want, excellent support, and you won't even know you are wearing it.",positive
I am enjoying my new bra. Well I have been buying Bali bras for years.  I have been very satisfied with them. I would continue to buy tthis product.,positive
"Nipples Upward and fashion backwards, this bra is a blast from the past that takes getting used to for those of us with larger endowments (40D and up). Usually I am trying to slightly minimize the overwhelming appearance of my chest (I wear anywhere from a 38G-44C, depending on the brassiere manufacturer), but this rather comfortable buttressed wonder is ""an all signs point to two Kilmanjaros"" kind of affair!The sort of high-construct, seamed directly-over-the-nipples cups, heavy-duty, thick-banded bra that macho litterati Ernest Hemmingway and Mickey Spillane would have waxed over, and the Godfather of bras, Howard Hughes would have machinated. And while it does fit great (though runs large), and makeS you feel sexy as all get out, it does NOT work with about 75% of my wardrobe, or most modern wardrobes I would venture, as clingy knits, spandexes and thin t-shirt cottons are the order of day. The back band of the bra sticks WAY out under any rayon-thin, drapey fabric, and that's with the correct size; it is just a clunky kind of bra.But since Amazon sells these Bali Flower Underwire Bras so inexpensively, I decided to keep it anyway. Under thicker shirts the back band is less noticeable (but not the upwards-pointing nipples!). Hell, I might even buy another one in the suggestively named navy, ""Midnight."" You could run without bouncing with the bulls in this! Spain is waiting.",positive
"Dave's wife:I bought this bra at a local small business and haven't been able to find the petite band size I need since then. I finally found it on Amazon for a better price than I paid in-store. Thank you, Amazon!",positive
The Bali Flower Underwire Bra is the most worn Bra I have ever worn. I have several colors to wear and have never gone wrong with my attire. The underwire is uplifting and very comfortable,positive
"Myself and my girls are just loving this bra, they fit comfortable and i feel lifted.  I would recommend this bra to all the ladies in the house with no regrets this is a wonderful buy",positive
"I almost always order Bali bras because they are true to size.  I ordered 44DDD and it fits me perfectly and is very comfortable for maybe half a day.  After about 5 hours the underwire started to poke under my arms.  I much prefer not to wear any bra with an underwire because they are notoriously uncomfortable, but apparently there are none in my size.  The covering on the underwire is quite soft and cushiony but still the wires poke through into my under arms.  I am disappointed but maybe I am ordering the wrong size.",positive
Have owned this name of bra for quite awahile and would't wear a different good style fit and price. good uplift,positive
I love this brand and make because I needed something that would give me good coverage. And it does. It looks good when wearing blouses and shirts.,positive
"The rings and adjusters are plastic in the DD's and below which I don't like, other then that they are a great fitting bra that looks great!",positive
"Really cute looking bra, but a poor fit for me. I have used Bali underwire bras for years, but I've never had one that didn't fit me well. So I had to return this one to Amazon. And I have to say that I am so pleased with Amazon, the way they handle returns makes it so very easy for the customer. Thank you, Amazon!",positive
"Well made.  A bit small 34B, thinking of returning for larger size...not sure if I want to go through the hassle.",positive
Large breasted women will love this bra! This bra makes me look and feel like I've lost 20 pounds! Good support. Very comfortable. Perfect in warm weather. No shoulder ache or cutting in. The straps stay in place! An underwire bra that doesn't poke me. Ideal for wearing under button front blouses and retro fashions such as sheath dresses. Highly Recommended!!!,positive
"Sports bras for DD+ are a big load of nonsense. This does everything a sports bra is supposed to do but does it better. Get yourself a non-stretch Granny bra, get the right size and you're golden.",positive
"Other reviewers have said it and I must wholeheartedly agree! The Flower Bali is the best garment that Bali manufacturers, and they've been making them just like this for many, many years. If you are looking for something to give you a neat appearance under sweaters, t-shirts, dresses -- casual or dressy -- you have got to try the Flower Bali.",positive
"Itchy, pointy, and VERY uncomfortable! How in the heck did this bra get so many good reviews? I think one star is one too many.",positive
"This isn't as 'sexy' as some bras, but it looks GREAT under clothes, and is supportive without feeling constrictive. Sometimes when this is sold in outlets, something is 'off' in the material; it's a little scratchy....but from Bali or as this was sold from Amazon, it's l00% right.  Washes well and lasts so much better than some of the fragile bra fabrics.  Maybe not so special for 'date night', but for a great bra to wear all week, it's terrific.",positive
"I really wanted to like this as an everyday bra but unfortunately while support is good, the shape is quite off, cone shaped cups are rather rigid and leave the 50's bullet impression that is quite unnatural and not flattering on anyone.",positive
"This is my second Bali bra. I have both the beige and white. I would buy more if they offered other colors in this style and size because it's the only bra I've found so far in a 42B that doesn't need ""enhancers"" to fill the cups.",positive
"First, some sizing notes: This bra runs big in the band. I wear a 30F or a 32DD, depending on the brand/style. This bra fits me perfectly on the smallest hooks. In the long run, that'll make it uncomfortable and big on me, but it's so awesome otherwise, I'm giving it five stars, especially considering the low price.Small band sizes are hard to find. I'm glad Bali makes some 32 bands. Most American companies do not, and those of us with the unfortunate combo of small band size/large cup size usually have to purchase very pricey European brands.  That's another reason I'm giving this bra five stars. I paid sixteen dollars and change for it. It fits as well (and is more comfortable) than most of my fancy high end bras. No, it isn't as pretty, but one does need some plain bras!Yes, this bra is truly old school. It's not stylish enough to be called ""retro."" Has Bali been making this bra since the early 1960's? It looks like that might be true! Thing is, for those of us who are big and saggy, this shape can be very flattering. I'm a small gal with a big chest, and old school bras are really great for my shape. No, I wouldn't wear this under a tight t-shirt, but it's fabulous under any other clothes. I am surprised at how ""natural"" it looks with clothes on, 'cause it really gives one old school torpedo shapeOn to the scratchiness that so many are complaining about. Out of the package, this bra feels really fake and almost plastic-y. That sounds awful, doesn't it? Well, I don't find it scratchy on, and believe me, I am very, very sensitive. I'm always complaining about bras! This one is very comfortable! However, I would venture to guess that if it was too tight, it wouldn't be. The elastic seems less scratchy to me than many of my other bras, and this weird fabric actually feels quite good on. Another thing is the straps. Some have complained that they fall down. I am surprised by this, too, as I have very small sloping shoulders and I've found the straps stay up easily.Gals, get fitted. If you're wearing a bra that doesn't fit properly, you'll be making the straps too tight, and that's when they start falling down a lot. A bra in the right size is a must. It's hard to find when you are my size, and I wish this bra came in a size 30, but it's so darned close to perfect and such a great price that I'm very happy with it!",positive
"This is nothing short of a screaming deal.  If you are full figured, you know what a problem it is to find a decently priced, well made, designer bra.  Bali is a name brand in this area, and their bras are excellent quality, and pricey.  To get this bra at $7.80, in white, including super saver shipping, is incredible; you cannnot even match this price at outlet stores.  I originally bought three of them about three weeks go, and they just arrived.  The sizing is true to other Bali bras I have purchased.  I just put one on, and it is wonderfully comfortable.  One particular feature that was not described on the web page, nor in reviews, is the back closure.  It was just what I wanted:  four hooks (vertical), in three separate sets (that means there are 12 separate hooks) for providing about one inch play in the width.  Again, this type of closure is difficult to find.  The only thing that I would have liked was some elastic on the straps; however, they do adjust in front to somewhat avoid cutting into the shoulder.  As of today, they are still at this ridiculous price, so I ordered three more.Next day note:  I wore the bra for over 10 hours yesterday, and it's the closest thing I've found to not wearing one at all.  To address concern in other reviews regarding the shaping, i.e., looking ""pointy"", yes, there is a bit of that.  For those who prefer form fitting clothing, this could be a problem.  This is not a minimizer bra; those will flatten you out if you prefer that look, but the price you pay is in comfort.  At my age, 62, I can tolerate the peaked look because it totally beats the saggy look.  I tend to wear my blouses and sweater tops very loose, so that this issue is not a problem for me.  At the very least, this bra is perfect for working in the garden, when I'm typically wearing an oversized T-shirt.  Another note regarding itching...mine do not, and I have pretty sensitive skin.  However, a suggestion would be to wash the bra first before wearing it the first time.May 28, 2014 update:  These bras wear and wash well.  To keep them in good shape, they are washed in a garment bag with the hooks clasped to prevent bending.",positive
"Have been buying this style for years, never disappointed.  Good support at a fair price.",positive
"I BUY ANOTHER HAD ONE BEFORE ,I LOVE THESE BRA THE BONES WAS NOT TOO TIGHT. IT FEELS GREAT SUPREME COVERAGE.",positive
"After trying this on, I'm wondering what bra everyone else got that posted a review. It's comfortable and supportive, but it ran at least a full cup size small. And the shape - so much torpedo. My chest was so pointy it looked sharp. I'm sending it back before I hurt someone.",positive
"First got this bra when my daughter was doing a performance with a lot of jumping around.  Her bra wasn't making it, and we looked for one better.  Found this, perfect.  Due to the non elastic straps, and the fine support, this bra holds things in place all day long, better than any other bra I have ever owned.  My daughter and I are both well developed.  Most bras are challenged when it comes to supporting us, except this one.  It is also very comfortable.  You know it's on, but it never hurts.  It also puts your chest in a good position, not spread out but forward.  Looks very flattering.  Truly great support, and pretty.",positive
I wear a 38 DDD and finding a well fitting pretty bra was hard.  Found the Bali Flower over 30 years ago and it has been a very good bra for me.,positive
"This has been my favorite bra for Years! Every once in a while I do try a different style but I always go back to this one. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the strap on my right shoulder slides off my shoulder so I do have to wear a rubber thing I found in a bra shop made just for that problem, it kinda bothers my skin, reason I try others. But I've never wornout any of the others before I'm buying another one of these..... they just work better for me. These I wearout & have to buy new ones.",positive
This fit great. Great support. It fit the bill for a bra to wear with vintage dresses. And my husband approves!,positive
"bra is super cheap when it comes to material to have the bali name...supports as well as can be, but would not waste my money on buying this style again. should be on clearance rack or featured at much lower price",positive
This is an awesome bra. It has a very full coverage old fashioned fitting style but it was perfect for me while I was pregnant.,positive
I have been wearing the Flower Bali for more than 30 years. I Would not even consider wearing  another bra.,positive
Good fit and flattering bra.  I like that it doesn't have the padded shell as so many bras have today.,positive
"Though the cup is a bit large I'm still giving it 4 stars. I'm broad around but have a smaller bust. The overall fit is very good & quite comfortable.  Overall, I'm pleased with my choice.",positive
"Since I had a need for one, my bras have always come from a certain popular lingerie chain. Mesmerized by their bust boosting miracle bras and fabulous looking models, I really never thought of straying. Problem was, their bras didn't fit me well, and definitely didn't provide me with the shape I desired. Their molded bras made me look saggy and lumpy, albeit bigger, but certainly not flattering. Plus, I was paying $40 to look this way, so I began to look for other options.Enter the Bali Flower Bra.....  excellent support for my small bust and a more natural and feminine shape. No longer do I have one single rounded lump for a bust line, but two shapely, lifted and separated breasts! Best &#34;perk&#34; of this bra, a slimmer looking figure. Turns out proper support really smooths things out and emphasizes the waist line... can't argue with that!!Now, at that other bra place, I generally wear a 34A but since that was not an option, I opted for a 32B and I'm glad I did. The tighter band is actually very comfortable and the cup is absolutely perfect (for once, with a little manipulation, I actually fully fill the cups!).Now, if you're a fan of the rounded molded cups, stretchy straps and a seamless appearance, this might not be the bra for you. But if you're looking for a classic, slightly more conical look, and solid support, this bra is perfect. For those who, like me, enjoy wearing vintage clothing, look no further this is the 40s or (less severe) 50s silhouette you are looking for.Finally, the lace. It's pretty, this is a pretty bra, but should you try it on straight out of the package and determine that it's a good fit but far too itchy, wash it once or twice--- you might change your mind.Very happy to find this bra, I certainly will be buying more.",positive
"I chose this low rating because this bra is highly structured and not made for comfort. It's not right for me, but others may like and choose this type of bra. It reminded me of the 1960's.",positive
"I was doing a lot of reading online.  And the bras with the best support are seamed bras.  Most of the new seamless bras are overly padded and flatten me out.I looked at my local stores but it's very hard to find a seamed bra that isn't a minimizer in huge sizes.  Most start in D cups.This is an attractive bra visually and I would normally just order up one size,  but I look like I should be the musical ""Grease.""  Or in a 1950's TV show.My husband said I was a walking weapon in this thing.  I could use my breasts to poke the eyes out of a potential attacker.It does not look like the photo of it on amazon.  Anyone who put this on, would have to push their breasts into the front of the narrow part of the cup to fill it, and would end up looking pointy.",positive
Bras's are hard to find in the size that I need and this one came in the perfect size. I am glad I found it on amazon.  It gives excellent support.,positive
"I am very pleased with this bra.  It gives me a shape and is so comfortable, I forget I'm wearing it.  I bought one somewhere else a while back and was delighted to find them on Amazon so I ordered several more.  I just hope they never stop making them!",positive
"After literally years of searching for a bra that fits, I finally found it!  The Bali Flower fits perfectly.  It is comfortable for hours at a time and looks pretty, too!  Thanks, Bali.  Now...please don't discontinue it!",positive
"I doubt anyone's body is this shape, or that anyone would rate the fabric as comfortable, it's scratchy!Nothing like the picture...",positive
"After becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the uniboob look of my current minimizer bra, I decided to purchase the Bali Flower Underwire.  This bra does provide good support, but alas, digressing from the uniboob to the torpedo look was not my goal when I bought it.  I have given the bra three stars for this very reason.",positive
"Unlike other bra manufacturers, Bali always fits me. Tried a lot of manufacturers and a lot of sizes but Bali is consistent in sizing for me.",positive
This bra is very comfortable. The fit is exaclty perfect according to the size chart. It holds up well and maintains size and form after many washings. I've bought three now and plan to buy more.,positive
"Being a very busty woman, I'm constantly looking for a bra that will smooth and minimize my proportions. Bali is a trusted name in intimate apparel, so I tried out this bra. I love the way it feels and how it makes me look when I wear tee shirts and sweaters. It runs true to size, so I didn't need to return it for a larger size. I recommend this bra to women who have the same problem as I do with finding a bra that will fit and look good!",positive
"I find this bra the first time I wear it is excellent, but then I wash it in the machine in a bag...and it seems to shrink in the cup!  I don't get that at all.  I]I'm a 38DD right now and losing weight, so for a cheap bra I can wear till I get down to a 36C this one will do.As the title says, not the worst, not the best...just ok.  And the 38DDD cup is just too big...I tried it.",positive
Comfortable great bra. I'm not one to like wearing bras but this one is nice. I will be ordering it in more colors.,positive
I love the way these cups cover me.  I don't care for the cleavage most bras are designed to show these days.  Hurray for this simple cover the goods bra with underwire for support!!,positive
"I love this bra! It fits great, and is very comfortable. It definitely is a minimizer bra. I would definitely order this bra again!",positive
Best minimizer,positive
i wear bali bras all the time and i knew that this one would fit like it was suppose too. i have no other comments for this item.,positive
"This bra does provide support & lift, but it is not 'seamless'.  This bra is part of the Bali &#34;Classics&#34; collection, so it's been around for a long time.The cup isn't a stretchy type of fabric, so you can see a little of the cup material through my tops.  And, you can see a little of the cup seam (slightly).I just bought Bali Passion For Comfort Minimizer Underwire Bra, and that one is seamless-  that one is a stretchy type of material.  It smooths out over the breast.  So, you won't see the cups through your tops with that one-  although that bra fits a bit more snug.",positive
"I've bought this brand of bra off and on over the years, but have noticed that the bras that come in white are about 1 1/2&#34; longer in the back.  I don't know why there is this discrepancy but the white bras are perfect.  The black bras can be used and fit fine, but you need to purchase a bra extender to place on the hooks at the back.  If it weren't for that, these bras would be in the trash.  This is a good bra in that it is not skimpy, but manufacturer needs to correct the defect in the black bras.  I'm hoping they are not making the white bras shorter and only the black bras are are affected.",positive
"This bra fits great, wonderful support plus it looks so pretty, very comfortable would buy again bought usual size perfect.",positive
This bra offers all the support in the world for a full figured woman. It is  very comfortable as an all day at work bra. The only reason i&#34;m not giving it five stars it that it does give a little pointy look to the boobs but not the cone look so its still  very flattering.,positive
"this is the second round with purchasing these bras. Amazon has the best prices, and easy to find the size needed. Would recommend this product to everyone.",positive
"I chose this 5 -star rating because I'm accustomed to this bra, have been wearing this brand for years. Tthe bra fit as it should and was received in the time specified. I bought three of them this time around and as usual i'm quite satisfied.",positive
This is my all time favorite and over the years I have owned many.  Of course they don't last forever .  Elastic has not progressed since it was first used in undergarments.  Of course this is what sells more bras? The wide straps can be unsightly if they show,positive
I LOVE THE FIT AND THE LOOK. THE TEXTURE ALSO FEEL VERY NICE  TO MY BODY SO I WILL PLACE ANOTHER ORDER REAL SOON.,positive
"Its a great minimizer bra, works well on reducing the gap between the buttons. Two problems, it will show through thinner cloths and very low neck blouses. But great for work shirts!",positive
Bra fit and has great support but the cups have a very pointy shape which I don't like. The fabric is not the softest and can be very itchy.,positive
I really wanted this to fit and be my go to bra because it holds you up and in so well but the sides are to high on my underarm and it chafes. if find this to be a problem in some bras so it's not a defect but probably my body vs someone else's. I tried going down a size but didn't help.,positive
This is a good fitting bra and the brand is a long standing and trusted brand. I would recommend it for its flattering fit.,positive
Had to size up to 38 band as it was too tight. The quality of bra is excellent. The color is a nice neutral.,positive
Purchased this bra for my grandaughter who has extremely large breasts. She was pleased and so was I. Will purchase more!,positive
Since Vanity Fair stopped making my minimizer bra of choice years ago and then Lane Bryant stopped making their minimizer I have had a hard time finding a minimizer bra.  This is the best one I have found.  Wish they made all the colors in all sizes!!!,positive
"Bali makes such excellent bras.  This is very great at minimizing.  There could be a tiny more in the lengthening ability of the straps, but really looks and feels great!",positive
"I have purchased this bra for years and will keep doing so. Very good quality, fits me very well. There is no digging into shoulders or the wires digging into you.",positive
ITS A COMFORTABLE BRA AND MADE VERY WELL. I LIKE THE WIDE PADDED STRAPS AND SATIN LIKE MATERIAL. GOOD PRICE.,positive
"I love Bali bras.  I am very full chested and only Bali seems to fit and support me so comfortably.  The minimizer offers a little help with the size of my breast (so I don't look like I have 2 great pyramids tied to my chest.)  The price here was a great bargain and I get the bras I love!  Thank you, Amazon!",positive
"Not the bra for large breasted women unless you're planning on pointing torpedoes at Mars! Seriously, what were they thinking when they made this bra. I am a 38DDD and definitely not happy with this bra. I would say it's more for smaller breasted women who enjoy pointy breasts.",positive
Great fit. This is my favorite style. It is comfortable on the shoulders and fits better than any other bra I have tried.,positive
"I love the bra, the cup size is perfect. The bra just fits around me too tight even in the last loop.",positive
"It does what it is supposed to and is my favorite brand.  Make sure to hang it to dry, or it will wear out too quickly!",positive
"The bra is strong, sturdy, comfortable, the straps are delightful no pinching or squeezing.  The lift is amazing and the 3/4&#34; reduction makes the clothing look and feel much better.  Will be ordering another soon.",positive
I've been wearing a couple of bras that has no underwire and gives great support and is amazingly comfortable. So I'm afraid I've gotten spoiled.  This bra fits just fine but it's going to take getting use to an underwire again.  It 's very pretty.  and the fit ts true to size.,positive
I'm 56 yrs old. Size 34DD. There are only two bras that I can wear. This is one of them. Amazon is a great place to purchase it as the price is less expensive than stores (Kohls rarely has my size in stock) and it seems to always be in stock. I hope Bali keeps on making this bra. Within the last year I did have an issue with a bra (a piece broke) but I called Bali and they replaced it for free.....UPDATE..this has happened twice....the adjustment pieces on the straps are made of thin plastic. Thin plastic to hold up DDs??????? Cheap.,positive
"Sports bras for DD+ are a big load of nonsense. This does everything a sports bra is supposed to do (separation and compression) but does it better. I also wear the Flower Bali to the gym and tend to prefer that: my breasts have more depth than width and the way minimizers work is to compress the tissue along the width of you chest instead of holding it out. I think minimizers create a terrible silhouette, but this is an excellent choice for exercise.",positive
Bali bras are the best......especially if you're full figured. Wonderful price. These bras were half price compared to department store prices.,positive
My daughter has a great deal of trouble finding a good fitting bra.  This one was fabulous.  We will definitely purchase again.,positive
Wonderful love this bra. I have quite a few of these. Bali has been making great bras for me since I was a busty teen.if I were smaller busted I would still prefer this type of bra.,positive
This underwire bra is the best I've ever worn and one of the longest lasting. I have it in three colors so far. The minimizing effect is an additional bonus.,positive
"I understand most minimizer bras give you somewhat of a classic missile t*t look, but this was just weird. Very snug around the waist, the cup towards the torso was Ok, but there was a very weird &#34;reservoir tip&#34; at the nipple.So sad because I love the color and micro leopard print! It has to go back.",positive
These bras area great!  Good quality and fit well.  They are  not the typical minimizer - this bra does not just squish you and move things to other places.  I have a problem with straps digging into my shoulders.  This bra takes all the pressure off my shoulders - no more digging in!  They wear forever and the support lasts.  The price is great too.  I don't wear any other style.,positive
FULL SUPPORT I HAD ONE BEFORE HAD TO BUY ANOTHER.GREAT BRA GIVES YOUR BUST FULL SUPPORT. MY WHOLE FAMILY WANTS I=ONE LIKE THIS.,positive
This bra is very comfortable and a very good fit.  I like the straps and the way the cups fit.  It is just about perfect for me.,positive
"I found this bra at Macy's for $36. I found a cheaper 36G in another brand in store but only by a few dollars, and it fit like a DD! This bra fit perfect and I ordered it off here for a grand total of $18 and something, so about half price. It's very comfortable and looks great under shirts!",positive
"Love this Bra, this is the only bra that I have complete support. I'm a 36G and people dont know unless I tell them because this bra minimizes and supports very well. This is the only bra I buy... Just wish they had more colors.",positive
"The bra fits a bit tight, was not quite the right size for me. I really like it though, its comfortable and looks good too.",positive
You are gonna love this bra! I bend over they don't fall out! I don't have the uni-boob makes me look slim. My clothes look better! Going to order two more.LOVE IT HAPPY HAPPY from hot mama. Well I look like it now lol,positive
"This is a great bra for support, but after a long day it is not very comfortable.  The under-wire should be more padded.",positive
"This is a great bra, however, I am sooooo over the minimizer mashed chest look.  If you are looking for great support then give this bra a try.  Has great lasting power and does keep you from moving around even during excercise, however, this puppy has moved on from the flattened look.",positive
"I wish my favorite bra had this kind of strap. Other than the strap I did not liked the way it fit me. I did wear it for awhile but not even close to wearing it out before I went back to my favorite....so, waste of money for me....",positive
this is another good bra I will just continue to keep ordering from amazon for my bras love them. I already got my sister to buy some also.,positive
Great fit,positive
"first off i'm 4'9, 34 dd, an its hard to find a great bra that actually fit.now because i'm heavy on top, i have the bras that have skinny straps that dig into my shoulder leaving me sore and a mark. this bra is heaven, it fits like the picture.now it doesn't give much lift if that's what you, want but it supports an don't poke you (wire) or cutting into your shoulder.now far as making me size look smaller... yes! and when i wear shirts it don't leave those lines.i will buy more!!!",positive
"soft, attractive, and I will purchase again.",positive
it fits a little tight and i am not sure if it will fit better once it stretches a little,positive
"This was the very first bra I've ever owned where I did not have that extra row of boobs.  Very comfortable and form fitting and non-cutting. Sometimes bras that are for larger breasts cut along the sides, but not this one. Money well spent.",positive
"This is a great product for a great price. I have been wearing this style for years, but have never had such a great bargain. I couldn't believe the fast service!",positive
"I've worn this bra for years and ordered my usual size--38 DDD. Like many others who wrote reviews, it was way too small. I had to size up to get the fit I had before with the smaller size.Overall, I find the bra comfortable and it provides great support. Just size up.",positive
I like this bra. But it does squeeze me on the sides. The boning digs into my skin. I think this will be alleviated after a few washings.,positive
"I have been wearing this brand of Minimizer bra for over 15 years and I won't buy anything else. The fit is great and it lasts. I wash mine by hand and hang to dry and it fits fit like it just came out of the package. It does a good job of minimizing and this helps with finding tops that fit better. Not only does this bra have great support, it is very comfortable.",positive
"38DDD.  I wasted way too many years buying Lilyette.  Lilyette quality has diminished dramatically over the past year and I was concerned about finding an alternative.  I tried the Bali Satin Tracings Minimizer and was pleasantly surprised.  The Bali is rather comfortable. Washes well.  Life-span is average.  You'll know when to buy new when you feel the fit change.It is also a 10X better minimizer than any other bra I've tried.  In fact, I used to need apparel tape to keep the front of my blouses from gapping.  With the Bali, my clothes fit perfectly without needing that bothersome tape.  Hopefully, they will make this bra forever and leave it just the way it is...don't change the fabric, don't change anything to make it &#34;new and improved&#34;.",positive
"I think I will like it better once its washed several times and stretches just a little.  I have had these before and found the same thing.  If they offered half sizes, I would have gotten a half size larger.  I know the next size up does not fit...its too big, BUT this is a nice bra, does a good job of minimizing.  It does go up a little into my arm pits, but I don't think that will bother me after it softens up a bit.  Like the straps and shape of cups.  Well made.  I would love to find a bra that I give 5 starts to but probably will not in my lifetime.",positive
I've worn Bali for years and usually wear the snowflake style.  This time I ordered this bra and I like it even better.  The fit couldn't be better and it is so comfortable.,positive
"I have been wearing this particular style for many years, and was happy to find a great deal on Amazon. Much better and more dependable than other internet sources I have tried, and so convenient to use.  This bra covers quite a lot and is very comfortable to wear.",positive
"I love AMAZON.  My sister in law is an AMAZOn lover too thanks to the beautiful Bali bras I purchased for her.  She loved the fit, quality, and the great value I got.",positive
"Bought this for my girlfriend who is pregnant and she said that this bra is supporting her heavy boobs and need to get more. I going to surprise her with a few more, wish it comes in more colour.",positive
The fit on this bra was not right for me.  So I returned it.  The straps are awfully short and can't let them out enough.,positive
I love Bali products so you can't go wrong with Bali.  This is my 4th.  I don't feel the wire hence it's very comfortable and also minimizes,positive
I have purchased this bra at Kohl's before. Great support and well made.This is a great deal and arrives very quickly! I am Very Happy!,positive
The bra fits true to size however is VERY STIFF and a bit uncomfortable. It also has a unrealistically old fashioned style that makes it unflattering to look at. Keeping it because it great for minimizing but not the prettiest under garment in the bunch,positive
"These are the only nightgowns I have.  They fit well, pack well, wash and dry well.  They are comfortable to wear in all seasons.  I just bought several more and the robe to go with them.",positive
"Lovely fit, stayed on my shoulders, soft cool material and went through the washer-dryer without a problem. What is not to like about this night gown?  The length is perfect for me, although I'm 5'8&#34; and it comes a bit below my knees.  The flowers are very feminine.  Choose purple and save some money!",positive
"I liked the gown, very pretty, however, I was purchasing for my Mother and she wanted the long gown.. So I returned and found the long gown elsewhere.  She was very pleased.",positive
"Buy to gift to my grandmother. She love it, and want to wear everyday!!  Perfect to use in home really comfy.",positive
This night gown is very pretty and very comfortable.  I will order more in many different colors.  The detail on the yoke is very nice.,positive
This gown is an absolutely beautiful gown that feels like a million dollars. I purchased it in this deep purple color as a gift and I can't wait to give it.,positive
Comfort and fit is great.,positive
I must say that I do love Shadowline products which are so very comfortable and fun to wear to bed.,positive
The sapphire color was the only option in my size 1X.  Not crazy about the color in person.  The fabric and construction is good quality.  Neckline is a little higher than I expected (compared to Vanity Fair or Miss Elaine).,positive
"This is a beautiful nightgown.  The fabric is a nice weight, and not at all see-through.  I usually order nightgowns one size larger, so I have room to move when I sleep, but this nightgown is very roomy.  I had ordered one size larger than normal, but had to return the gown, and get my normal size.",positive
Like the gown very muchLike the quality of the materialFits nicely and comfortableWill purchase this brand again,positive
I like this gown.  I admit it looked a little old-ladyish when i ordered it but it's really quite cute.  It's modest enough if you have to pick up the paper in the driveway.,positive
"I have several Shadowline nightgowns, but this is the first one I have seen in black.  With the pretty red rose embroidery, I knew I just had to have it.  It is very pretty, washes well and is quite comfortable.",positive
The perfect quality of Shadowline tricot is tops in the business.  There is no other that compares.  I'm replacing 20 year old Shadowline gowns just because after 20 years they're a bit discolored - that's it - the fabric stays as perfect 20 years later as it was day one.  Excellent product & here an excellent price.,positive
"I have worn these gowns for close to 20 years.  I like how they are made without any itchy lace or scratchy seams, how they make rolling around in bed easy, and that the fabric is a better quality than any other nylon nightgown I ever owned.  I also like the &#34;flutter&#34; sleeve especially now that my upper arms are not what they used to be, it is nice to have them covered but not constricted by a traditional sleeve.I knew that the Shadowline brand had been sold in recent years, so I was a little concerned about the quality having changed.  I just bought 2 in the magenta color since it was new (for me anyway) and was delighted to find that the quality remains.  I have always gone for the darker colors since they seem to afford just a little more modesty than the pastels.",positive
I have loved these gowns for years - they never disappointment me. They hold up extremely well. I will purchase this brand many more times.,positive
"I bought this and the matching robe in pink as a gift.Recipient (my mom) said it's too sheer for her and is essentially see-through.  That might be ok (frankly, it wouldn't bother me - sounds nice and comfortable), but it's not for her.If you are questioning among the reviews whether it really is too sheer, I can say that at least in the pink and at least for my mom, it is.",positive
My mother in law wanted a new night gown and she likes the light weight one's.  She really like this one.She said it is comfortable and fits her well.  She is very small and petite and the length was good for her.,positive
This is an awesome gown.  Have been wearing these for years. The gown is not flimsy nylon but a high quality material.  You can't go wrong.,positive
"This Shadowline Nightgown is very well made, and very comfortable to wear. The fit is perfect and the softness of the material makes for a wonderful experience. This nightgown is perfect for lounging and sleeping as it is as luxurious as it is comfortable. Oh, the price was excellent for the quality of the nightgown! I definitely recommend them and will purchase them again in the future!",positive
This is an excellent product that will keep bra straps perfectly aligned and prevents slippage.  They are very comfortable and work well with any bra.,positive
"I have very narrow shoulders so my bra straps constantly need hiking up. Many years ago, I finally found a Wacoal that stays put but it no longer fits and is being discontinued. I have tried every single other brand on the planet and they all slip off so I got this to hold them in place. It works perfect. I wish I didn't have the extra bump across my back but it's better than constantly reaching in my shirt to pull up slipping straps. I like that it is adjustable, too.",positive
This works and stays in place. I wear Soma allura bras and body by VS and I'm bigger busted. It's pretty comfortable for what it is but I am shopping around for a bra that won't need this.,positive
"... but I am not an acrobat.  Takes me more time to try to get it on than it's worth, at least, in my opinion.",positive
I've always had a problem with my bra straps slipping off my shoulders.  This has solved that problem.  The only thing that you need to do is make sure your bra is hooked and step into it pulling it up from the bottom.  Once up the straps will straighten out.  It's so nice not having to spend the day pulling up my bra straps.,positive
"We received these shoes as a gift, and I'm actually ordering a larger size for my daughter now.  I love these shoes!  They're so adorable, and we constantly receive compliments on how cute they are.  My daughter has been ""standing"" since she was about a month old, and she's actually started to wear out the bottoms from pushing herself along when she's in her walker.  Even so, I'm really quite pleased with the construction and materials.  They're very easy to slip on wiggly feet, too.  These have become my go-to gift for expectant moms with a baby girl on the way.",positive
"Too damn cute! I love these shoes! Now, the only problem is we're not so sure yet when my sister's baby is going to be able to wear this. It's too cute!!! If they're having a girl, I'm getting her a pink one. :)",positive
"I loved these shoes as soon as I saw them. My son hasn't been able to wear them yet (I purposely bought them bigger), but I can't to show them off!",positive
"great product, very stylish for baby, i made a mistake on choose the rigth size, when the shoes arrive to my home my babu has growing up and the shoes cant fit on them.",positive
These shoes are very cute.  I can't wait to see my friends baby in them (right now she is still a bit too small for the shoes).  The shoes also came in a nice box with a clear cover to display them.,positive
"I have ordered pairs of these infant converse for both my son and my daughter when they were infants. I got so many compliments on them when I took the babies out wearing these shoes. They really made an outfit seem so stylish.The shoes are a very soft material that will be pleasing to your baby. The soles are soft material, as well.  I found that these shoes are really best for pre walkers or indoor use while walking, otherwise they get really filthy because the material of the soles is white canvas type material that really shows dirt. I have thrown them in the washing machine but they don't get all of the stains out from walking and can look really dirty, which detracts from the look of the shoe. So, I liked them best when I just used them on the babies before they hit the walking stage. I also don't think that the bottom of these shoes grips well enough for a walker. If you want a pair of converse for a walker then I recommend getting the hard rubber soled converse which will not show dirt as much, and which grip the ground well. You can find them here CONVERSE Kids' All Star Core Ox TodI also feel that these shoes run a bit small so I recommend going the next size up, which will also help you get more use out of them. All in all, they are adorable shoes and the height of baby fashion, and they are comfortable as well. Get a pair and get ready for lots of compliments when your baby wears them!",positive
I bought these for my grandson who isn't here yet but can't to see them on him.  They look just like the adult shoes.,positive
Cool Converses for my little one. We needed a size or two up from the 1 she outgrew. I love the stylish versatile kicks. Goes with practically half her wardrobe.,positive
I ordered these for my son that is due in Septmeber. Since Daddy always wears Chuck Taylors I wanted them to match. They are just adorable and I can't wait to see what they look like on him. We are using them as a prompt in our maternity shoot which will be fun :D,positive
Shipping was a little slow compared to how things usually come. But shoes are perfect for my baby girl and I can't wait til her foot  is big enough yo wear them!,positive
"These are the cutest things ever. My baby takes off her shoes constantly, and these are great because they lace up and she can't get them off. They run slightly big, which is good too. I love them.",positive
"I bought this brand and Danskin tights to see if there would be a difference in quality (I haven't been big on Hanes, as a brand, before), rather than stock up on a bunch of colors in one brand.I'm glad I did it this way, as I won't buy these again.  They ended up getting a run the very first night I wore them, then they just tore into a hole.For starters, I didn't even like the way they felt.  They didn't stretch well (I have big hips and bought the size supposedly appropriate for me, according to the chart), and they were too snug around my upper thighs, of all places.  It's like they designed it for children's legs.. very runway model, ignoring that women's thighs are typically bigger than their calves.And they were SO THIN, I might as well have shaved and wore nothing.  I bought white because I was hoping to get some white sheer like the picture, but it was nothing like that.  So don't expect these to hide any hair/blemishes you have on your legs, or even look like you're wearing white tights.The only reason I can think of that this gets two stars rather than one is the price and I'm pretty sure they arrived when expected.",positive
These pantyhose provide terrific tummy support and do a lot to highlight my legs.  The &#34;reflections&#34; look great as I walk.,positive
I keep coming back to this product.  Hanes feels very nice and silky on your legs and they look good as well.  I would recommend.,positive
"Just got these and I love them. True size, good quality and they really do their job with the &#34;control top&#34; thingy. I would buy them again.",positive
"I have had so many Hanes pantyhoses in c/d size, but this is not c/d for sure. It was too small and short. Very off size and false advertisement. Unless Amazon is selling defected or off sizes of this brand/style.",positive
"These tights are extremely soft and very flattering. They fit perfectly and looked very sleek and of high quality. The only thing is, I purchased the barely there color and it is a little darker than the picture. In fact, it is more of a tan color and would go perfectly with people who have a tan complexion like I do. You really can't tell I'm wearing tights until you come closer and even then, it is such a nice, sophisticated look. These tights would go great with formal evening wear and dresses.",positive
"I have been wearing Hanes Silk Reflections for over 15 years now and I still love the sheer look and silky feel of them on my legs. I have many pairs of Hanes Pantyhose for daily wear in different colors as well as Silk Reflections Thigh Highs and Stockings. I have tried other brands but always come back to Hanes Silk Reflections. I have tried other brands of pantyhose that are as sheer but not as durable, I have found some that are as durable but not as sheer, Hanes has it all for me.  The fit is perfect they do not bag or sag at the knees or ankles even after a long day.I am an Amazon Prime member and that has been wonderful the shipping is always fast and on time. Whenever I can find my Hanes hose with Amazon Prime available I purchase them. It is so much easier to buy these online and have them delivered at no cost I am so happy with my Amazon Prime membership.",positive
"my legs are mostly in no nonsense pantyhose but a co worker said to try the hanes sheer nylon pantyhose, i really like how sheer my control top sheer toe silk reflections pantyhose are, these pantyhose are very soft and sheer nylons, like all of my pantyhose when i pull up very sheer pantyhose i take my time so i dont run my nylons and pantyhose, once on i love how these pantyhose make me feel, i prefer reinforced toe pantyhose but sheer toes are nice also. i wear pantyhose and nylons everyday and now have several pairs of hanes pantyhose.",positive
"Very sheer, which is good, but the Caf&eacute; Au Lait  color has more tan to it than I expected.  Overall, still a good purchase and I will buy more in other colors in the future.",positive
I always feel hose of any kind not quite as long as I would like. I am 5'7&#34; and weight 129 yet they always seem to be &#34;not quite&#34; as long as I would like for an easier fit.,positive
"Not only do these hose fit, but they really do exert control comfortably.  They are  also strong (have used for years) but have a silky quality.  Cannot speak highly enough about this purchase.",positive
they last pretty long and the color and length are fine. I actually have been able to wear each pair more than once.,positive
My wife is 5'4 and finding these in many brands was easy but that is not the case anymore and this is easy again.,positive
"The stockings are great.  The color itself isn't really ""barely there,"" though. It's more of a sheer dark tan versus a natural color.  Just fyi.  I'll order another color to get what I'm actually looking for.",positive
"In one day I got a run and had to get a new pair, exact same problem.  Won't be buying these again.",positive
"I've tried a lot of expensive pantyhose and these hose compare with the best of them .They look and feel fantastic and fit like a dream, feels like my legs are dipped in nylon...very luxurious and sexy.These pantyhose say more than feminine,  these pantyhose say female. ..",positive
Had not thought about buying hose online but this great! Using prime it was free shipping! I don't live around any stores that sell hanes and it would be a 75 minute drive to find them! Thanks Amazon! ....oh and the hose! Hanes Silk Reflections are very very sheer and are a great step in-between tights and tan legs!,positive
"These are good hose with a generous fit.  Pearly white color was perfect for me.  I am tall 5'11"" and they still fit me just fine.",positive
"Hanes needs some better quality control these days. The color I ordered, &#34;barely there,&#34; is a very dark color. It is supposed to be so light and transparent that anyone can wear it and appear to have bare legs. Overall, Hanes is a good product and fits well, but it's a hassel to bother with returning things when they don't catch color problems like this.",positive
"I got these nylons for a party in winter. The &#34;Jet&#34; color is a nice light black, not opaque like tights but definitely noticeable. I prefer nylons that have some color so it's clear I intend for my legs to be an unnatural color, and not just strangely tan or bandage-pale.I'm 5'5&#34; and 125lb, and the size A/B fit perfectly. They were comfortable all night.",positive
I have been buying Silky Reflection pantyhose for over 20 years!  I love the soft feel on my skin.  They fit just as the package fittings recommend.,positive
"Normally I'm a bit leary of combination sizes, but these fit great and the quality of these panty hose is excellent!",positive
I bought these pantyhose based on another customers review and I was not disappointed!  They are quite lovely on and the control top does the &#34;tucking&#34; I need it to do! Put my heels on and felt so pretty!,positive
"Nice standard pant hose by a good company, has a nice shade, would be nicer if they were cheaper but will work.",positive
Have been using the same size and color for years and really like this style.  Amazon is the only place to consistently get this product since my local market always runs out of them.,positive
"These fit way too small, in my opinion, and they are not heavy enough.  I like my hose to be a bit thicker.",positive
"she does like these but she has worn out a few pairs. so for the price they are good but higher price last way longer so in the end may be a better buy in reality. that said, we were satisfied with the value.",positive
i didnt like how the size chart is not accuratestockings are well made however nothing specialprice is decent,positive
"nice material pattern and design, can wear it under things or alone, good for work , dress or lounging. washes well, great color",positive
I've been needing a nude shade and this one seemed to fit the bill.  However it is really thin and will probably run immediately.  Also I'm not too sure about the color for my skin tone.,positive
Had they not got a run as I was putting them on I might give it a higher rating... Was bummed.,positive
"I bought these in a hurry so I didn't research the size.  If you are a big-hip beauty, I do not recommend.  They fit fine until I had to get them past my hips.  I gave it five stars because after all the wiggling and pulling, not one run appeared.",positive
"I love Hanes Silk Reflections pantyhose.  I have been wearing them for over 15 years, I have tried others but keep coming back to Hanes.  I love the feel and looks of them they fit me perfectly and still look good after a long day.  They feel wonderful on my legs and feel great under my clothes whether I am wearing slacks or a skirt.  They are also very durable for such a sheer pair of pantyhose.As an Amazon Prime member I used the 2 day free shipping and received the package on time and in good shape.",positive
"i love my hanes pantyhose, they fit and feel great on my legs, i wear no nonsense pantyhose and hanes pantyhose to work everyday and these pantyhose are another one of my favorite nylons, ive had a few runs in my pantyhose from time to time but all my pantyhose have had runs in them.  these pantyhose are wonderful to put on and make my nylons look sexy. i also wear silkies pantyhose nylon stockings, leggs pantyhose and other nylon pantyhose. i wear pantyhose everyday in high heels and usually my nylon feet are in sheer reinforced toe pantyhose. but i have lots of sheer toe pantyhose and nylons.",positive
"This classic hosery is still one of the best out there.  It looked great all day, and the color is no natural.",positive
"Hanes always gets it right - size, comfort, good make and quality. These are true to size and feel great, smoothing out the contours of the legs.",positive
"These hold up and are a great value. They are also very pretty and flatter my not-the-best legs. I don't like wearing pantyhose but in a professional job they are still needed. That's my opinion, anyway. I have some great dresses and suits with skirts for work (yes, I am the consummate professional) and these are a necessary accessory. Is 'necessary accessory' an oxymoron?Thanks, Hanes. You make me thinner and more impressive.  How many products can honestly boast that?Marcianne Waters",positive
"I went ahead and purchased it, thinking i'd be getting tanned color. For some reason, i have this way of thinking buff= dark/tan color... Turns out it was not even close. I normally wear barely there, and this one was very creamy. Although this isnt something i would wear on a normal basis, it did go really well with my black skirt w/ white feathery sweater top. I wouldn't dare wearing it with any other though, just not my color; Too bright. It was a nice try though.",positive
"I don't like control top. if you're already wearing a skirt or tuck in your shirt or have something around your waist, this control top deal makes you feels like you are being squeezed to death. it's just too tight and uncomfortable and really it pushes in some places.",positive
"Sizing was fine, but they have a 'texture' to them which caused them to get pulls quickly and weren't very comfortable to wear.",positive
"Got this for my wedding, im darker in colour but just because im wearing white all through, i want everything to compliment.. Nice Hose.",positive
These pantyhose are really terrific! The legs are very silky to the touch and the control top lets you shed a couple of those unwanted pounds without a diet !,positive
"I think a color labeled &#34;Barely There&#34; should be much more neutral. I realize that if I had a dark tan or were of a different ethnicity perhaps these hose would look &#34;barely there&#34; on my legs. But as it is they remind me of the nylons I wore in junior high, colored &#34;Cinnamon.&#34; In fact I may send them back, I'm so disappointed. The shades depicted online are not at all representative. Cannot speak to fit or durability as I haven't tried them on yet.",positive
"Great job from Hanes.  As promised, this pantyhose is silky but well-made.  Hanes is quickly becoming my go-to brand for beautiful stockings.  Needless to say, I highly recommend Hanes for all your hosiery needs!",positive
"Hanes offers the best quality panty hose on the market compared to similar products. The hose is durable which I like most, nothing worse than for them to rip or run right out of the package. Wash and wear and it still goes strong compared to others. Consider me a fan of Hanes products!!",positive
"Fit, slick, good feel. I did get a runner though at the wedding. When will there be a hose product that doesn't run yet look sleek?",positive
"Ok ladies, pantyhose, in general, are getting difficult to find anymore.  Many women hate them.  But, for those of us that don't have a problem with them, it seems as though there are expensive tights or leggings to choose from, and no more 'pantyhose'.  Let alone NAVY.  This is the real deal.  I plan on buying more for my 'stash'.  These are the tried and true navy pantyhose and I keep a few pair in my desk for that occasional runner that might happen once every other year.  You get what you pay for, and these are a bargain for the quality.  Love them!  Thanks for carrying, Amazon.  Now, I can save gas money from running all over the place looking for navy hose.",positive
Very light weight in texture  I sent them back. Still waiting for credit. I thought for the weight they were too expensive. I was looking for more warmth in this product,positive
These tights are high quality and have held up wear through many wears and washes.  The fit was as expected.,positive
Good price and shipping nice color goes with most outfits heavy enough on colder days great size comfortable Thanks a lot,positive
"These are soft on the skin, they fit and they don't sag or bag (i.e. comfortable). I think these are a great value. I also got a pair of smart wool tights - and I'm finding these almost as warm but MUCH more durable and economical. I've bought more.",positive
I go through a lot of tights and these ones have lasted the longest!  They fit great and the color I got (lagoon) is awesome!  I get a lot of compliments on the color.  I have a dog and she likes to jump on me so I get a lot of runs in my tights and I have to throw them out!  These tights have stood up to my dog's claws numerous times and they still look good!,positive
I have purchased opaque tights at local department stores and they did not fit orprovide the opaque look I wanted.  These are perfect in every way.Highly recommend!,positive
It is so hard to find a demi bra in 38DDD first of all. Second this fits amazing!! It is cute and so comfortable! The bottom does roll under a bit but not bad just if I am lounging on the couch and up and down alot. I am not sure how well its going to hold up over time (I don't think it's going to be more than a year) but totally worth the $$$$$ !!!!!!,positive
"I am a true 32DD and this bra is very beautiful and true to size!  It is delicate, while still being supportive.  Great buy!",positive
"I'm accustomed to push up bras because of my lack of endowment, so this was definitely something different. Straps are nice and thick. Back band is wide. Front portion lays flat underneath bra instead of tilting up. Cups themselves are two layers of lace that support nicely but do not form the breast as a padded bra might. Will not hide *ahem* signs of 'cold weather'. Middle portion does tend to press into the chest. My boyfriend will love it when he gets back from the holidays.",positive
"I found the band to be a little bit snug, but it otherwise fits pretty much as expected.  However, don't be fooled by the picture for this item.  Unless you have naturally perky breasts or you would actually wear a half size and size down, your breasts are not going to sit that high in the cup.  As with all demi bras, beware: any upper chest side boob fat you may have will be smushed into adorable little rolle, in a most unfortunate and highly visible manner.  Don't buy this bra if you are carrying 20lbs extra or more.  You will not be happy with the results.",positive
A little stiffer than I would have liked. But because the waist does run slightly smaller it fit a bit snug in the underbust and under the arms. I am sure that also the stiffness contributed to that. But if you order a size up on the waist size and are looking for something sexy and not something to wear for support all day it is a super cute and sexy bra...,positive
The Whole thig was Huge I normally wear a size 38DDD so I figured I'd be fine with a 40DDD but the straps were huge! Even with them tightened all the way it's like they expected my boobs to be a lot closer to my belly button then my shoulders. I had to cut 5 inches off the straps and re-sew them to get it wearable and even then the fabric was so worthless that it did absolutely nothing other than make me not naked.,positive
"This bra is pretty, and I do love the &#34;bounce&#34; that a good balconette bra gives, but the straps on this bra stretched out almost immediately, resulting in me constantly pulling up fallen-down straps all day.I wouldn't recommend this bra is you're a large-breasted woman.",positive
"This bra fit nothing like the Wacoal and Natori 32DDD bras I purchased from Nordstrom.  I won't say it was too large, or too small because that wouldn't be accurate.  It just wasn't *right*....",positive
"In the interest of helping others...I'm 5'6"" and 134 lbs (yeah, I know...working on it!). I'm a true 32DD in most brands. My ribcage actually measures at 31.5"".First things first: this bra is beautiful, sexy, not the least bit trashy and I have been waiting for it to get marked down (THANKS AMAZON!!!). I purchased it in the black and its lovely. It has a lovely lace overlay and the cups are unlined. The seam you see in the pix is comfortable and doesn't telegraph through to a t-shirt/tank top.  The cups give a nice rounded shape and come up high enough to not have any quad-boob or spillage after I bend over to pick up a wiggly toddler. The straps seem to do a nice job of supporting my 'girls' without cutting into my shoulders. The back has three hooks. The band is soft/not itchy and seems slightly small. I LOVE that the underwire doesn't come up too high. It hits at a very comfortable spot on the sides. For some reason, where the underwire meets in the front REALLY pinches. I really want this bra to work so I'm exchanging it for a 34D in hopes that its sister size will be a GO. Fingers crossed!UPDATE:Ordered the 34D. THe band was more comfortable (perhaps slightly loose?) but the cups gapped on the top. I must be fuller on the bottom.  It made the girls point down and out. Very sad, indeed. Sending it back. It is beautiful...though. Maybe for someone else with a different shape.",positive
"I have 40dd breasts and it so hard to find a pretty bra that looks sexy, but still holds the girls in.This is perfect as it is a mixture of balconette and demi so you get some cleavage without everything falling out like most of the plunge bras.. I went back and bought in it ivory as well! I a hooked.",positive
"Fits as expected, with a nice thick band.",positive
Felina products fit very well and are very confortable to wear for the whole day. Do watch for new styles to come out from them.,positive
"Online this Bra looks Delicious! I mean it holds the Babies in while looking Nice and Fashionable. The problem?I think my Babies were a little too Big ... a little too much for Poor Old &#34;Felina|Harlow-Unlined Demi-Bra.&#34;They, I, didn't feel comfortable, nor safe walking or playing around in it.  I think this Bra is best designed for smaller Babies, cause HOLDING my Babies was a bit Little Shady with The FELINA-Lady!YOu dig?",positive
"If only they had them in my size! I am a 34 G, but decided to try the 34 DDD since they don't make this bra in my size. It is just incredibly beautiful- but, alas, it was too small, and I didn't want to have to go to a 36 inch band in order to make the DDD work for me.",positive
I love this bra! It is comfortable and fits very well. I plan to order more. It arrived much sooner than promised.,positive
"I got this in both the black and the ivory, and I love them both. When I first went to wear them, they were a little scratchy in the beginning, but they became more comfortable and now are my favorite sexy bras. The part I enjoy most is the straps with the ribbon detailing... if the straps peek out, they look so pretty!",positive
"So if you are among the overly blessed like myself (34DDD) then you will find that most pretty bras are just not for you. I like this one and even though I ordered the correct size I found myself sort of spilling out of the top ever so often, and really really spilling if I bent over at all. Just becareful maybe order a cup size larger for this particular design?",positive
"This bra fits, looks sexy, feels good and was just an all round wonderful find and good purchase.  Get one if you can.",positive
"I love this bra so much. It doesn't give a strange shape to my chest like some unlined bras with underwire do. It's super comfortable and fit perfectly. I got it in City Rose, and it's more of a bright pink but I still love it. Planning on getting more in different colors.",positive
I love the color and the fit its kinda itchy but after you wash it a few times its perfect,positive
Not to sheer can wear under semi sheer tees without anything showing nice color against skin just the right amount of uplift would order again!,positive
"This is cute but it's scratchy in all the places you don't want it to be scratchy like the band and the straps. The straps have nude felt-like material for additional durability but I think this is what is part of the problem because the material used is cheap. Anyways, don't buy this one--go to the department store and find another cute one.",positive
"seller shipped it pretty fast & i was pleased to get this brassiere.  it perked up my asset nicely.  in fact, i bought another pair for me for a great price.  i wished the alabaster color was on sale & had my size.  unfortunately, it was out of stock.  hopefully, i'll get it for a great price (again) in the future.",positive
As a sissy it's so important to feel feminine when cross dressing. My breast inserts fit quite nicely into the cup. I love the pink color which is my favorite color!!! I love prancing around and feeling dainty in this bra!!!,positive
"I bought this to match a pair of panties to make a sexy set, not for comfort. Boy was I surprised when this bra made it's way into my &#34;comfy bra&#34; drawer. I think I'll end up with four more of these. They made your girls look great, you feel sexy and it is surprisingly comfortable.",positive
Fit perfect and it was a good price for the size. It's hard to find bras the exact size I need so I was pleased when this bra fit as expected...,positive
"The bra is very nice and good value for money. It fits perfectly, is very comfortable and rather sexy. But I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use for those who like more relaxed style of life.",positive
"This bra is amazing, it's supportive and super comfortable.  I'm a 36DDD (sometimes a 34) and this fits like a dream.  Also, it looks fantastic on, I will be ordering in more colors!!",positive
"Nice looking bra. Super sexy, not itchy, boobs look amazing! I will be ordering more because it is so hard to find sexy bras in the larger sizes",positive
I love these bras. I've bought them in all different colors. The only thing that I can complain about is the fact that the underwire tears through the fabric. I've had to sew all of them. They're thin and comfortable. I'm quite busty with a small rib cage and it's hard for me to find bras that fit but these are my favorite.,positive
I was surprised by the high quality and great fit of this bra for a really affordable price.  Lots of detailing not really shown in the photo.,positive
"So, why am I happy with this? It is a 36 B, and I pretty much fill it out. As others have mentioned, sheer bras are normally way too large in the cup, usually because they're stretchy. This is not stretchy through the cup, and I couldn't be happier. I'm built lanky: long arms and legs, broad shoulders, small boobs. This does not dig into me, and I don't find it to be itchy. This is working for me. I am so freaking glad it doesn't push my breasts together!!! All that does is make them look smaller, and, well....squished together. How that is supposed to help, I have no idea. Who ever thought that up? This allows them to sit a lot closer to where they want to sit (they tend to point outwards just a bit), however, it DOES GIVE SUPPORT. This is a small miracle. Hats off to Felina. And, thanks to all the previous reviewers whose comments clued me in as to how this would fit!",positive
"This fits wonderfully and is very flattering, definitely a great deal!  I will be ordering more soon, hopefully in different colors!",positive
"Felina makes some really great underwires, central gores, and band structures. Of the various brands of bras I have tried, Felina is the only one that creates bras that will perform to the standard that a good fitting bra should on me: stay on with the central gore flush with the breastbone, cups around the breasts, and underwires against the ribs under the breasts WITHOUT the straps on shoulders or band fastened. Seriously, the only brand. They seem to have the perfect structure for people with large, firm, dense, close-set breasts on a narrow frame. I've been fond of various Felina bras in the past. Unfortunately, the cup fabric does not quite perform quite as well. Felina bras tend to expect the vertical center line of your breasts to be farther toward your armpits than they are on me. This seems really odd to me given how well the underwires fit and lay flat. It causes some sagging at the top of the cups and any seaming or cup fabric structure to not line up properly with the breasts. This particular bra has the added drawback of having weird fabric. It's a stretchy mesh with either lace or stitching of some sort in a lace-like pattern. The mesh stretches and conforms to your breasts while the lacy detail prevents the fabric from moving and conforming. Unless you're toting basketballs around, this causes some weird indentation effects where the lacy detail is. Overall, the cons outweighed the pros for me.",positive
but i liked it. it makes her chest looklike one of those marie antoinette women. we had to exchange for a larger size though.,positive
"Great usual Felina fit no surprises here. Has a nude colored lining under the lace, looks very nice. Good support, too.",positive
"this bra is very supportive, and finally I feel sexy in it. it fits like a balconette, however keeps the girls up and in place",positive
"The bra looks lovely on. The strap design gives the effect of skin peeking through, & the shape it gives is surprisingly natural, I.e., more of a sloping, projected look as opposed to very round & boosted up. So that's either a plus or minus depending on your preference. But the straps are very thin & fairly rough on the sides; I found they cut in after more than a couple hours of wear.",positive
This is a good looking bra.  When Felina state it is for a full bust I get one cup size smaller than I would on other bras.  I recommend this product.,positive
"The Bra looks exactly as photgraphed. However, I was expecting a soft feel instead the fabric is very rough around the the underwire and even the cups. the straps are lined so they were ok. Couldn't wear this for more than a few hours. I donated it to Good Will",positive
"Couldn't find this brand in my size in the Mall where I live.  I was first introduced to this brand years ago at a large department store.  Glad I found some Felina styles here.  Fits well, though the straps could be a bit wider for the larger sizes.",positive
34dd lilac bra. Super pretty  and feminine. I want to get all the other colors now. And yes it fits just fine.,positive
"I wear a 38C Bra size, and this bra fits the bill!!! Love it!  I just ordered another one.  I would highly recommend this bra.  It is very sexy, and comfortable.Update:After wearing this bra for a day, it's NOT comfortable.  I would not recommend it all, and I have returned the other one that was ordered, and the one I kept goes in the ""Not form fitting, and comfortable"" draw.  I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead, so far it is very comfortable, and fits nicely to the breasts.  I will be ordering another pair!",positive
"These bras look as beautiful as they look in the picture shown.  However, they are cut a bit shorter at the top. Although not padded, because of  having strategically positioned seems one can wear them under T shirts and thin sweaters and not worry about revealing too much.",positive
"This stunning bra is every girl's dream bra. It has the right perks for any bra to have, from being comfortable to the adjustability. It can match the likes of the Coobie Strappy V-Neck Lace Trim Brasas this bra is like nothing else.",positive
"We got this GPS for my husband who is an (OTR) over the road trucker.  Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the ""trucker"" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!",positive
"I'm a professional OTR truck driver, and I bought a TND 700 at a truck stop hoping to make my life easier.  Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6""), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted ""No Trucks"" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.  Hasn't gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips.",positive
"Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.",positive
"Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6"" bridges when I'm 13'6"". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.",positive
I am using this with a Nook HD+. It works as described. The HD picture on my Samsung 52&#34; TV is excellent.,positive
"This adaptor is real easy to setup and use right out of the box. I had not problem with it at all, it is well worth the purchase. I recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your Nook videos on your HDTV. I just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor, I found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my TV. For me it was just right not too long or too short, I was able to place my Nook right below the connection on the TV stand, it did not fall or anything else, it is fine. Use your own judgement, I'm too busy watching my movies :)",positive
"This adapter easily connects my Nook HD 7&#34; to my HDTV through the HDMI cable.  This is good for traveling because it makes any hotel TV a potential smart TV so long as there is an accessible HDMI port.  It is also good for sharing photos from FB on a bigger screen. A bit pricey, but a good accessory to have.  Be sure to note that this is ONLY for the Nook HD and HD+ series.  It will not work with a standard Nook.",positive
This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind:- You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom. It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate.- The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place.- On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid.- It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV. Nice they made such a device.,positive
"This item is just as was described in the original description, works without any issues to be seen. Good product",positive
bought for a spare for my 9&#34; Nook HD and it fit perfectly.  Very satisfied with the price much less than on the BN site,positive
"My son crewed my HD charger cord so I needed another one, this is exactly like the one my son destroyed.",positive
"This is a good beefy 2 amp charger, but it covers two outlets on a power strip. It's ok in a regular wall outlet. The best thing is it uses a standard USB connector so it can charge more than just a Nook (I have a Kindle Fire HD+).",positive
"I lost my B&N original cable.  I looked around for an new one.  I tried  a different, cheaper model but it didn't fit my device properly so back to the drawing board.  I ordered this one.  I am satisfied.  It works exactly as expected and fits perfectly.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a spare or in lieu of the original usb cable adapter.",positive
"It does 2A and charges a DEAD Nook in a few hours. It does so with a LOT of heat, compared to most wall worts. I have a dual charger where 1 port is 2.1A and the other is 1A for total output of 3.1A that doesn't run as hot as this. And i use that to power a raspberry pi to avoid needing a powered hubIt does the job adequately as it's designed to. Just hot. I would always unplug it if not using (even though it cools off) because of the amount of heat made. The nook hd+ runs hot too right where you hold it on the left side in portrait, but not so much when charging. I guess it's better to have it at the plug.",positive
"Go to Target or Barnes and Noble instead, and pay $25 (which is still a huge markup, considering they make the thing for 50 cents.) This is the worst option if you need one of these. It's price gouging, pure and simple.",positive
"Works well, a little pricey I think for a charging cable, but then again, not losing the original would be a lot cheaper than any replacement",positive
"This is a great buy, compared to a $60 or more a retail store.",positive
This mount is just what I needed.  It is strong and sturdy.  It folds almost flat to enable the television to sit square and flat against the wall if desired and extends and rotates for angle turns.  A perfect fit as long as you match the correct visa pattern for your television.,positive
"Great deal, easy to mount and it appears to be fairly sturdy. I mounted a 32 in tv on it and it works great.",positive
This mount works really well once you get it up and going.  Only problem is just the arms are a little goofy getting them all in the right spot.  But that's really not too big an issue considering all the different TV's and their mounting hole locations.,positive
for the price you just cant beat this item. I bought it for a house I was selling so I could hang some tv and it worked great. Good quality for the price.,positive
"I received the mount, which was well packaged for shipping.  The installation instructions were Moderately clear.  No issues following them, they were just a little disjointed depending on the wall surface you were installing on.My shipment had a mis-cut piece, and was missing 4 screws.  I contacted the Manufacturer, and they shipped me a replacement part and screws the very next day (Shipped out of Texas, so normal mailing times applied)I like how the Mount fits together, and I easily mounted my 60lbs TV by myself.  The part that attaches to the TV has a hook that will hold the TV on the Arm till you bolt it on.It's very adjustable, and pushes almost flush with the wall.I'm very happy, but took one star for the miscut piece.",positive
"Took a bit of work, but used this to fit an older vizio 32&#34; monitor to the wall to use as a compute monitor. Stable and like the ability to move the tv to different angles. The vizio was older and did not have the standard holes, this product fit and holds the tv very stable.",positive
I used this for my 47&#34; Samsung. Its fit/feel is great. Easy installation. Appears strong; although I personally spent way too much on the tv to risk leaving it fully outstretched with too little lag bolts for a long time! It is very convenient to be able to move it away from the wall however and I would feel very comfortable tilt or swiveling if needed. The movement is fluid and easily adjustable.I am very pleased with my purchase.,positive
"This item serves its purpose as well as any other mount.  Its most appealing attribute is its large range of motion.  I am using this to corner-mount a 32"" TV and it works perfectly to hide the mount, receptacles, and cables behind the TV.  Very easy installation as well.",positive
I love this mount.  This is the 4th one I've bought and it works great every time.  excellent seller and excellent product,positive
I am very glad for buying it.  It is heavy duty and good quality for the price.  It was very easy to install.,positive
this holds up my 55inch sony with ease. make sure u mount this with ur own lag screws into the heart of the 2x4 ur mounting to and u won't have any problem--u may have to make a modificatoin or two but use ur brain and figure it out-- it'll be there till the house falls!!!3inch lag screws is the way to go don't be cheap go buy em.---how much did u pay for the tv????,positive
Nice quality still works great... very happy with this purchase... need to add 10 more words.. so what can I say its a wall mount that I haven't had any problems with,positive
"Great bracket for small TVs.  I used it on a 19"" LCD and it worked well.  The large mounting plate may block some connections on some TVs.  Installed easily and could be adjusted to make level.  The links were very tight and need to be loosened for initial installation.  When the TV is in the desired position, you can tighten them up.",positive
"I bought this for a 22"" TV for my son. I mounted this onto the corner stud and it works great! I love the angles it can achieve. Fees Very sturdy and well built. It works perfect for my application. Very happy with this purchase!",positive
"I am using this mount for a 39 inch Vizio TV and it has been great. The installation process was quick and easy and we LOVE the variety of angles that you can get from this mount. We have it on a side wall in our bedroom and we can pull the tv out and move it completely perpendicular to the wall on which it is mounted if we want to. (We don't usually move it quite perpendicular, but it works to do this.)My only complaint is that the joints are a little on the stiff side. It takes quite a bit of force to move the TV from one position to another. It's a little hard for my wife to do-- especially with the TV mounted about 6ft up on the wall. It may be possible to loosen these pivot points, but I have not tried. I'm a little nervous about making it less stable if I do.Overall, it's a great mount. Highly recommended.",positive
"I installed this for my sister who had a 22"" Philips LCD. Nice sturdy mount, with all of the nuts, bolts, screws included. Only problem was that since my tv was so small, and I was using the most inner mounting hols on the mount, the outside edges of the mount covered both the cable connection, and the power cable connection. Instead of returning, (then paying $70 from a local store) I simply went to a hardware store, got a 1 & 1/2 inch boring tool that attaches to a hand drill, and drilled holes into the mount. It was pretty easy, but a bit messy. It is not visible after mounting the TV, so who cares?? It is one thing to consider before buying this, there may be another mount that does not cover your TV connections. Otherwise swivels well, does not sag, good value.",positive
"very heavy duty construction, extends, tilts perfectlya steal at this pricewill be happy to buy another 1 or 2 if needed",positive
Well constructed wall mount for TV sets up to 37 inches. The mounting  plate has numerous holes for varius sets. Plenty of extra hardware provided. Price was about 1/8th of what it would cost on the open market. I recommend it highly.,positive
"I used it to mount a 32"" LCD TV to the wall... about 28LBS.  I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.PROS:-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.CONS:-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my &lt;30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit ""off level"" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the &lt;$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.",positive
"This mount is excellent. It is very well built and sturdy. I used it to mount a 32"" TV and it fit the need perfectly. The price was also very good and much, much cheaper than what an inferior mount would cost in a retail store. I would definitely recommend.",positive
Works great and is so much cheaper than the more expensive versions at the Big box stores. It is super easy to install yourself too. You just need a drill and a ratchet set to get it into the stud (oh yea a stud finder too).,positive
"Cannot beat this deal anywhere else on the web!  All other retailers are over-priced for what you are getting - a couple pieces of fabricated metal to hold a TV that articulates! This mount is reasonably priced.Pros:  Easy to install (helps to have a cordless driver to drill 6 pilot holes, and to drive in 6 lag screws. You also need to have a stud finder).- Well fabricated- Mount does everything advertised (i.e. articulates - you made need to loosen up some nuts)Con's: Really stretching here since this is a good deal: Instructions could use some help for the ""novice"" DIY'ersInstall tip:  It really helps if you have a second person assisting you for the final step of mounting the flat panel to the TV mountInstalled a 15.5 lbs, 26 Inch Flat Panel LCD (VESA 200mm X 100mm) to this mount. Mount works beautifully! I originally had the TV sitting a little high on a stand, but then the picture was not as good because of the upward viewing angle of the screen (inherent problem with cheaper LCD's - not being directly in front of a LCD screen) - this mount corrected this issue by allowing me to ""tilt down"" the screen.  I would strongly recommend this mount if you are in the market.",positive
This mount is easy to install and very sturdy and is very functional and very affordable for the price. A+,positive
"Works like a charm! Lies flat on the wall when I want it too and pulls out and swivels like a charm when I need it too!The instructions call for it to be mounted into a stud in the wall, however mine is mounted directly into the drywall using heavy duty anchors and it works perfect as well! This is a great product for an amazing price!",positive
"Easey to put together and install. Used to mount a 37"" LED flat screen. Instuction say to mount the complete unit but if you mount the TV to the back plate on the ground first its a one person job. Well built product for being made in China.wish you could buy American made, better luck next time.",positive
I hung this in my house with great ease and it held up my 8 year old son because I wasn't going to put the 55&#34; flat screen on it to find out that it failed. Fully extends out 2 feet. This was worth the money.,positive
"very secure, we did have to use concrete bolts thought since we were putting it on an outside wall made of lath and plaster with concrete brick on the outside.  One of the best features is there is one piece that attaches to the tv and another that attaches to the wall.  the piece on the tv actually hooks onto the piece on the wall.  I am really happy with this purchase.",positive
Holds the TV fine and the articulation is great.  We use it in a downstairs bedroom where we can move it to be seen from the bed or the treadmill.  Has cable mgmt as well.,positive
Another great buy from Amazon. The local stores wanted twice the money and the other mounts were cheaply made. this mount is made well and you get a free hdmi cable and level with it,positive
"This is the best mount I have ever found, especially for the price.Home Depot has a nearly identical mount for $90.This mount comes with every fastener you could need from Lags, Hollow Wall Anchors, Spacers, to varying lengths of Metric Fasteners to most if not all TVs.They mount easy and are sturdy; I have a 60&#34; LED TV on one without issue.I also have 32&#34;, 42&#34;, 46&#34;, and 50&#34; TVs on them; I have used these to mount every LED/LCD TV I or friends have mounted.",positive
"Quality was excellent. Instructions were clear. It was not clear about a tilt feature, but there was enough to level it when I finished. Be careful to get the wall bracket real vertical. (I was using it for a 23 inch computer screen so I really need it to be level for reading.) Everything I needed plus lots of extra hardware for different situations.",positive
"In the process of turning our master bedroom into a fortress of solitude for my wife, we decided to mount ourPanasonic TC-L32X2 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTVon the wall, above the dresser, to save some space. (You can never have enough dresser space for displaying tchotchkes, amirite, fellas?) My wife wanted a fixed wall mount but I thought the viewing angle required some articulation. (In hindsight, fixed would have worked, too.) This unit was highly rated and the price was right. Sold.The installation was straightforward and fairly simple. The only point at which I needed some help was in balancing the TV while I attached it to the arm; otherwise it was all me. I think it looks great; my wife says it reminds her of being in the hospital. (Sorry, Honey.) When we mount thePanasonic VIERA TC-P42S30 42-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTVin the living room, I'll definitely use a flat mount.You could spend four times this much on an articulating TV mount, but I don't see why you would.",positive
"I gave this mount 3 stars.5 to start because out of the box, and mounted on the wall, I really liked it for my daughter's room. The ability to move her 26"" TV around so she can play in other areas of the room is a welcomed addition.I subtracted 1 star because of the tacky instructions and poor cable management for something that moves at maximum, about 2 feet away from the wall.1 more star fell off because now that the TV is mounted, the mount seems to sag, even though there are two huge lag bolts in a stud mounting it. That parts not the problem, the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself, it seems no matter how many washers you use, it just does not make full contact. Also if you move the TV to a new position the mounts seems to want to ""fall"" in that direction on its hinges. SO it must be releveled by yanking on it every time it moves.Otherwise, it works I guess. But for $50 I'd rather have a stationary mount that I never have to worry about. I would not set a tv larger than a 30"" or so on this. I just don't trust it.",positive
"For the price, this wall mount is great.  Not too hard to install.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is wire management.  I could not get the little loop to work.  Not a big deal at all however.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.  Well worth the money.",positive
"Needed a corner mounted Flatscreen. This did the job well, easy to install. I had to mount in a metal stud, so I used two support boards in the back to distribute the weight more evenly. Expectations of item met at a fraction of the cost from competitors.",positive
"I'd never bought one of these, mainly due to the high prices in the retail stores.  I hadn't looked online much, and hadn't really needed a monitor mounting device until recently.This thing is well built, and it does the job.  It's not fancy but if you are just looking for an inexpensive way to hang a monitor (TV or PC) on the wall this will do the job.  It comes with a nice bag of heavy-duty hardware.  It is primarily designed for mounting TV sets, but you can get it to work with a PC monitor, as long as it has the VESA mounting.It mainly articulates side-to-side and in-and-out.  It'll pivot a bit up and down, but that's limited.",positive
"Only gave this four stars because it's only supporting a 32&#34; TV. I think I would be scared to mount a 55&#34; TV on it. If you sprang for a 50&#34; or bigger TV, spend a little more on a properly rated mount. As with any TV mount, make sure you're hitting wall studs with the main screws, don't just use anchors in drywall or you're asking for trouble. LOTS of hardware included in the kit, so mounting any style or brand of TV shouldn't be a problem.",positive
"Nothing fancy, just decent quality and simple installation.  As may have been mentioned, one must discard the provided Phillips screws that the manufacturer provides to affix the bracket to the wall stud.  Use your own.  The TV I mounted with it is an older flat-panel, so it's a little heavier than the news ones.  This thing isn't fazed, and stays where I put it.",positive
Amazing how easy it is to move my 46&#34; around on this mount and able to hang off one stud. Nice quality feel to metal it is made of.,positive
"Very sturdy. The arm is very stiff at first so you have to work it lose.  However, the mount works great, just make sure you get that stud just right. I was impressed with the quality and happy with the price.",positive
"The mount plate and the extender arms need to be screwed together and there are two holes for each arm to attach to the corner of the plate. The holes don't align so I couldn't put two screws in. I just used one screw which is not the most secure attachment. Then I used zip ties to secure the arm better. I did this because I had to install the tv ASAP and could not wait for a replacement. Also, the mounting bracket that attaches to the wall has a larger screw hole on the bottom. This means that the bottom can wiggle and the bracket will be misaligned. Again, I did a quick fix. I gave this 2 stars and not 1 because it actually stayed up on the wall and is now holding my tv, albeit due to my own ingenuity and not the quality of the mount. I should not have to do quick fixes on a product like this.",positive
"VERY HAPPY, it looks great, I'm so happy we got it. Holds good, it is a lil hard to get it to the wall. Other then that its fine I love how we have more room in our room. My husband is so happy I ordered this, it only cost us $28 free shipping and FAST(: VERY THANKFUL TO THE SELLER.",positive
"I wasn't willing to pay $100 for simply mounting a TV, so I bought this item to give it a shot. I have no real complaints.  It holds the TV up, which is all I wanted.  It does not have smooth pivot points, so if you're planning on moving it around a lot, don't use this one, but if it's going to stay in a static area, this is your mount.",positive
This is a rather good tv mount. This tv mount works exactly as expected and described. I would buy again.,positive
"I had to use a hacksaw to cut away part of this to hang my 24&#34; LED TV in my bedroom. Other than that, seems to work fine.",positive
"I have a 42&#34; Hannspree LCD TV. It weighs 42.5 lbs. Most other reviews said they had a TV smaller than this so I was a little skeptical but got it because of the good price and it said it could hold 60 or so lbs. Most of my reservation was because it was the first time I've mounted a TV and worried it would fall within a week. I've had it over a month and its nice to have it be able to swing out, extend, and angle. I like the fact that I can get a bigger TV and still use this mount as its in my living room. It was not too hard to install. I bought a stud finder because I didn't have one and most everything else I already had to install it. I do highly recommend recruiting some help with the install, at least for when putting the TV on. This would be extremely hard by yourself, especially if you have a bigger TV. Overall, very happy with this mount.",positive
Installed easy and in no time at all (finding the stud was the hardest part for me).  Articulates well with the 40&#34; TV on it. I would not hesitate to look for this brand when it is time for the next TV mount.,positive
"We got this one recently and its a great wall mount. The unit is pretty heavy, so you will need a helper. It also includes a variety of screws to mount also. Our TV documentation stated it was a 400x400 pattern. But after putting hte plate over the back, seems we didn't need the extra extenders as its 200x200. This is on a Samsung 40&#34; 5000 series LEDTV.The arm is hard to push and pull, but that is more due to being new and stiff. Make sure you adjust the tilt angle screws as our unit came with them loose so we had to tighten them.I initially was scared to mount it (what if it falls if I screw up!!!) but its pretty easy. Not only did i use a stud finder to get the general location of the stud, but i also used nails to get the actual edges (those basic studfinders are never &#34;exact&#34;). make sure you do the same.not bad for $30-ish",positive
this is a good product.  It went up easily.  I did it myself.  I wish I might have gotten one with a little more adjustment.  It's very rigid.,positive
I have purchased 3 of these wall mounts and they hold my 37 and 32 inch flat screens perfectly. I love these and highly recommend them.,positive
"Very good item; I am happy wit it, and delivery time was excellent!!  I recomended; is a good support for your LED TV. It is easy to install, and it have extra screws for different sizes TV.",positive
"This was perfect for my 24"" LED monitor, I had it up in just a few mins and with no problems.  It included a small bubble level and it also came with a 6' HDMI cable which I was not expecting.",positive
"I checked around Amazon as well as some other sites, and decided these were what I needed.  I read the reviews, looked at the pictures and bought two of these.  I received them today.  I unpacked one of them, read the instructions and immediately filled out the return request for Amazon.  These mounts are very, very heavy and require 6, yes SIX, screws to mount to the wall.  Are you kidding me?  The TVs are only 22 lbs!  Two screws in the studs and then more damage to the wall than is necessary.  What a joke!  And Lag bolts?  Ever heard of screws?  The other issue is that these are very hard to move.  I bought an articulating wall mount for a reason, and I expect them to be able to move without a wrench in my hand.",positive
"Installed easily, has a nice long reach.  Attached a 32&#34; TV for the grandkids and it works out great. accomodates many different size TV's and was a very good price.",positive
"For the price.....can't be beat.  I have two TV's hanging in the living room.  No issues, easy to hang.  I would recommend to a friend.",positive
Works Great. Holds my 40 inch TV effortlessly. Very well built. Definitely worth the price. Easy to install TV to the mount. Has cord clips. TV can be tilted up or down and sideways. Extends from the wall 24 inches. I highly recommend this brand..,positive
"Used this with a Panasonic 22 inch LCD. Very durable and works as advertised.It was advertised as fitting 22""-37"" televisions, but the size of the t.v mounting plate is so large that it covers some of the plug connections on the back of the television. I will have to cut the metal plate to get to the P.C connector if i choose to connect a computer.Haven't decided if i will keep or send back to get something with a smaller mounting plate.Other than that, it's a great product and meets my need for a hanging television.",positive
"I have a 47&#34; TV and had no place to put it in my bed room. With this mount it use the space i had a poster hanging. Very easy to install, came with all hard ware.",positive
"Great Mount, so many areas of articulation. This was a great gift idea my mother loves it. I have purchased two of them and they are sturdy and give a touch of class to every room you put them in. A must have any video file or those who want to save space in a bedroom or office.",positive
This is perfect for what I needed it for. I can move the screen from side to side if I need to and I don't have the TV sitting on my desk.....,positive
have not had the opportunity to install the tv mount as of yet - will follow up once mounted in place. great price and quick shipping,positive
Why pay the $$$$ at Best Buy when you can get the same products for a fraction of the prices here.  The VideoSecu Long Arm TV Wall Mount Low Profile Full Motion works great.,positive
"Pro's: Easy to setup.  Supports many different VESA formats. Has some articulation.  Sturdy construction.  Can be installed by one person w/o too much effort.Con's: Cable guides fall off easily.  The joints are a bit too stiff; you really have to man-handle it to get it fully extended, and you have to push fairly hard to get it to compact again.  So far I have not noticed any wear from this firm pulling/pushing, but I worry because it is only attached to the studs buy 2 bolts.",positive
We bought this for a 55&#34; Vizio and it worked perfectly. I would buy it again and recommend it. Good quality.,positive
"I am impressed with the solid design of this TV Wall Mount.  I think this weights more than the 26"" TV it is supporting.  It also has lots of logical adjustments so leveling the TV isn't too difficult.  The one semi negative is that it takes a fair amount of force to reposition the TV.  This does assure the TV stays put but if you plan to move the TV on the stand a lot this may be a negative.  Overall I am pleased with the stand - it seems like a good value.",positive
I bought the uint for a 32 &#34; Tando.  I couldn't get the parts to line up so I bought another fixed type.,positive
"Very well made, strong mount the only problem I have is the instructions are very poorly written or detailed. Pictures do not distinguish between Stud mount and concrete. Also the instructions do not tell you the size of the included boltsFor those of you who have never worked in the home building industry wall studs are usually 1.5 inches wide so this mount only requires 2 lag bolts in the middle holes to secure it to the wall to support a 23 lb TV. The four outboard holes on the wall mount are 1.3"" apart so don't try to use them in a wall stud measuring 1.5"" wide.Helpful hint: I have help install at least 6 other wall mounts because of family or friends so I cannot say that I am an expert but my suggestion is to drill pilot holes which the instructions do not tell you to do.After comparing the instructions on this unit to others I have installed I still must say that the pictures should have a lot more detail. Some complain that the back plate was too big for the TV they used but it's fits perfect on theLG 32LK450 32-Inch 1080p 60Hz LCD HDTVI am using it on.Works perfectly for the area of the room I am using it in which allows me to rearrange the room without the need to move the TV.",positive
"Perhaps I misunderstood how to install the mount, but I:1) Installed the mount to the wall (easy enough)2) Attach TV the mount with some screws (difficult for one person)With one arm I held the TV (heavy!). The other arm was trying to attach some small screws connecting the TV to the mount. It took quite an effort to hold the TV for that long. Certainly having two people installing this would be waaaay easier :-)I have another similar mount where the TV back plate and the mount are separate parts. So once the back plate is installed, you slide the connecting parts together. Much easier! :-)",positive
"I used this to hang my 40&#34; LCD that I bought back in 07, so it's a heavy TV that outweighs my new 50&#34;.  Everything seems to be made well, it was easy to install myself, and the TV has been hanging for 2 months now from a brick wall at it's full reach.  I can't imagine paying $100 for other TV wall mounts, as well as this one performs.",positive
you can't beat the price and the installation was simple as can be. We installed it in our office and it is perfect! no problems and was completed in a matter of minutes,positive
"Totally love this product!! I bought two - one for living room, one for bedroom.  I decided to try my hand in the bedroom first (in case I got frustrated and didn't finish the project).I've gotten items needing to be assembled before with all the hardware in one bag -- not so with this product!!  I'm impressed! Every nut, bolt, screw, washer, etc. is clearly packaged (individually by size and labeled!)The Arm also comes assembled -- which I disassembled for easier handling (the wall plate is attached to the Arm with two Carriage Bolts / easy to remove and makes holding in place while bolting to the wall a breeze).Took me 1-1/2 hours from start (gathering my tools) to finish (hanging the TV)  Oh, and I'm a 56 yr old disabled female.  I do have a  lot of construction/tool knowledge however.",positive
UPDATE: I have now have purchased 3 of these for work and home and with the lighter LED TV's this is a perfect mount for most sizes - this is a great mount - easy to install - easy to use - easy to expand - easy to mount TVs. I havent found another one that is so useful - even if you dont need it to extend this is still a great mount--- I guess for the price I was expecting something cheaper but I was quite surprised. It was easy to install and works for what I need it for - it may be over kill for a 22 inch LED LCD TV but I like the way it can be moved around.,positive
Used this for the bedroom. Put it in the corner but was only able to hit the stud with a couple bolts.,positive
The VideoSecu line of articulating wall mounts has become our standard of choice for high quality articulating wall mounts within our home.  The value is such that the convenience of having an articulating wall mount for connecting or reconnecting cables is well worth the few bucks required to mount our HDTVs conveniently to the wall.  Highly recommend this great quality product. This wall mount will secure any of the HDTVs using the VESA 100 or VESA 200 mount pattern. We like to use a mount on the larger end than actually needed so if we later upgrade the HDTV with a larger size there's a much better chance we won't need to replace the articulating mount.,positive
"This is a really well made and engineered product which should be twice the price. It has every kind of leveling and tilting adjustment you could want, and a nice finishing piece that goes over the wall plate and lag bolts.  The mounting process can't be rushed and planning everything out before you start makes all the difference. Just make sure you find the middle of a wall stud for the lag bolts.It easily managed a 47&#34; led lcd which weighs 35lbs, and it might take the extra 10-12 lbs of a 55&#34; led lcd if it's not pulled too far from the wall. Since it can swing out over 20&#34; I'd be carefull about going bigger than the 35lb 47&#34; tv that I mountedThe only thing which was dissappointing were the two plastic wire holders which are junk (very flimsy, one was broken in the package) and shouldn't be included when simple black wire ties work far better.",positive
My flat screem computer monitor is very light and didn't need such a heavy duty mount.  The product is fine and would work for monitors much larger and heavier than my 20&#34; LED,positive
"The mount I purchased is great. It is designed for TV's 32&#34; and under. The link here, and image are not correct. But, I really thought the mount was build well, was easy to install, and the price was fantastic.",positive
Tv has been on wall for a long time.  Hasn't fallen off.  It's metal and considerably cheaper than kits available in stores.,positive
"This is exactly what I needed.  It was easy to mount and supports my 40 inch TV (26 lbs) without any issue.  I haven't tested the extension brackets, but the rest of the device is very solid.  I will say that the hinges can be a bit tight, and it's not designed to be easily adjustable on the fly (you'll need a few tools).  If you plan on swinging your TV around a lot, this might not be the best choice, but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then.  My favorite part is the small base.  I didn't have a lot of wall space to mount a TV, and this met my needs without eating all my money.  Keep in mind that you'll want at least two people to mount the TV on this device.  I attached my TV alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while I inserted the screws.  Speaking of which, I've mounted two TVs on this, and the box included screws which fit both (in addition to many more).  However, you may need a few more washers.",positive
"This TV mount I bought for just $25 easily outdoes similar ones that cost over $100! It comes preassembled, is easy to mount on the wall, and has clear instructions. It also features a wire holder and cover for the screws on the wall. The joints are a little bit stiff, but with use and maybe a drop of oil this shouldn't be a problem. Definetely a great buy at a agreat price!",positive
"I have purchased this mount twice now - one for my bedroom TV, and one for my living room TV.  The bedroom TV is a 35"" LCD, and the TV in the living room is a 55"" LED.  (Surprisingly enough, they both weigh 50 pounds...)  This mount works very well for both of them.  It's relatively simple to install - you just need to find a stud and screw the support in to it.  (I will admit that my bedroom TV has been attached not to a wall stud, but a jury-rigged support brace on a cabinet.  It's still there and attached after 6 months.)I will say that the joints in the arms are quite stiff - it can take a little muscle to move the TV.  But I think I prefer that - it certainly doesn't feel flimsy, and it stays wherever I put it.A tip for would-be purchasers: make sure your TV supports this mount.  You can usually find your compatible VESA patterns in your user's manual.  (Or a quick online search, perhaps.)  As I often say - when buying online, it pays to do your homework.",positive
"Amazon as always 5 stars in service and shipping.The mount was for a VIZIO E260MV 26-Inch. Product comes adequate with a lot of screws, an Alan key and standard nut key that fits all the nuts. The bubble level (with magnet on the side) and cable are a nice addition.Had to cut 1 inch from the top and bottom of the base that gets screwed no to the TV, since it covered some of the inputs. Other wise very practical for my bedroom/Study that has more width so the convenience of swirling is why we wanted this and it does a good job.For the price ($25 and free shipping), its is a really good deal. Would recommend this.",positive
This device is somewhat weak even for the 46 inch TV weighing only 31lbs that I'm using it with. after some adjusting it's working ok.,positive
Easy to install and the TV is still on the wall after three weeks! I consider this a good value for the money,positive
"Very easy to setup, simple instructions, has all the mounting hardware and fits a huge different variety of TV's with great support.",positive
Very concerned over hanging a 46&#34; tv on the wall.  Got this mount due to low price.  Very impressed.  No doubt it will handle a 30# TV.  Allows full 90 degree rotation with 21&#34; from wall to centerline at maximum extension.,positive
"It needs improment. I wish it has one more hole to put a screw on the wall.It looks shaky for 55 inch TV. However, it still holds it.",positive
quickly shipped to my house and mounted myself. i ordered this for my 32 inch Phillips LCD tv and for the price i paid its a great value. does the job that any other higher priced wall mounts can do. would recommand,positive
"Very good materials, very lightweight,  cheaper than others brands. I have a 47&#34; LG Led tv and it fit at 100%, and I'm capable of sell my tv, buy an 55&#34; and use the same mount without problems.",positive
"Made in china, but this time , its well made. nice and sturdy and lots of options to mount differenct type of LCD. It has a good viewing set of angles and can be adjusted just about any view you want. the value for cost here is big, since most of these sale for over 75.00, or over 100.00 at wm. im pleased with it.",positive
"Mount went up easily and seems sturdy enough.  However, adjusting the TV sometimes leaves the TV crooked.  Also, it is almost impossible to adjust tilt without using the provided tools.  Even after using the tools, we couldn't really adjust the tilt to the full amount.",positive
"Great functionality, really incredible price, and a snap to install.  Honestly, ridiculously good product - wish they were all so easy.",positive
Quick and easy installation - very solid product. Very pleased with this purchase.When in need of this type mount again I will certainly purchase this brand/model again.Great price on Amazon makes it very easy.,positive
Excellent buy! We are very pleased with this item. It performs very well. The instructions were clear. It was easy to assemble. It holds a 47&#34; TV very well.,positive
"Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)",positive
"i bought a funky double hinged wall mount from amazon and it did not work. I went to best buy and they said to purchase this $350 wall mount they had, I snagged a pic of the measurements and extension ability from the box, came home and found this one to be near similar. Needless to say I now have my 47 in LG flat screen securely mounted and sitting pretty in the corner of my living room.",positive
I have 3 swivel mounts and this one is not the best. If you don't use the swivel feature frequently or don't place it where it may be bumped it will do the job. I prefer the strength and stability offered by mounts which have TWO arms extending from a longer wall bracket. These more stable brackets can be found at similar or slightly higher prices. Also look for a feature which allows the TV Bracket (and TV) to be lifted off the swivel arm more conveniently.,positive
JUST IN STALL ANOTHER SAMSUNG 55&#34; LED FLAT SCREEN. OUTSIDE A  PATIO DECK AREA WHAT A DIFFERENCE THIS UNIT MADE.THE MOUNTING KIT WAS VERY EASY TO USE. AGAIN I DID UPGRADED TO  USING LONGER HEAVIER MOUNTING BOLTS. THAT WAS ONLY $1.00 MORE BUT IT'S WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN. HERE IN EARTHQUAKE COUNTRY YOU NEES THAT SUPPORT. YOUR FLATSCREEN TV RETRACTS A FEW INCHES OFF THE WALL PLUS IT WILL LOOK SWEET FROM 2&#34; TO 24&#34; FROM WALL AREA,positive
"For a good wall mount of a smaller TV, this is perfect. Much cheaper than similar in various stores, and actually is more flush/compact than I have seen on others with all the adjustments you could want.Only gripe is that the included wrench to tighten the wall bolts is pretty weak and strips itself almost immediately, but it'll work to get it on at least. All hardware needed is included, I had to use a few adapter pieces on my first TV. Getting ready to hook a second one up on another rooms wall, both are 32"" screens. I feel confident they will be there until I decide to remove em.Wall stud mounting required, but depending on the stud size, you may only get two of the three wall bolts into the stud. Should be enough though.",positive
"I use this arm to mount my 39 inch Vizio. I'm surprised my TV has a 100x100 mount thingy. It can tilt left and right, up and down. I do wish it swiveled the TV so that it wasn't crooked. When the bolts get loose, my TV looks crooked.",positive
Was a perfect fit for my 32&#34; flat screen TV.  I would recommend this wall mount for that size tv,positive
"Good wall mount. Sturdy and does what it is supposed to do. In fact, it even held a larger TV than what it was listed as capable of holding. I believe I mounted a 42&#34; television with this one. Not a flat-flat one either. I mounted an older heavy thick one.",positive
"This was half the price of the TV mounts at Costco and perfectly fits a Vizio 37&#34; TV for the spare bedroom. It will work with many different brands so in my book that is great. Strong, sturdy and robust.",positive
"This is possibly one of the best mounting kits I've ever purchased. I like the fact that there are pieces so the mounting kit can cater to all models of TV. (Whether they have a rounded or flat back). Mine had a flat back so I didn't need the extra piece, but once that step was cleared it was only a matter of minutes before it went up on my wall.  The adjustable arm is nice, as it is setup in our bedroom. At night the TV is angled towards the bed and makes it super easy for both of us to see up on the wall, and during the day its turned in another direction towards my desk - also making the ability to view the TV while working.The material is very strong, hubby did a pull up on the bar and it didn't even budge.  This thing seems as though it will last quite a long time.  It's already been up for over a month and it was a wonderful addition to my master bedroom, I'll be purchasing more over time for the other rooms in the home with larger model TVs.",positive
Exactly as described.Very heavy duty.Lots of parts to make any installation work.Excellent value.Fits various monitors and tvs.,positive
"I bought three of these mounts for all the bedrooms in my house. I love all three of them. All mounts have different tv's on them, One is a 50&#34;, 40&#34; and a 32&#34;. Product comes with multiple screw for different tvs. Outstanding product for the price. All tv's have been mount for a little over a year. This product is a full motion mount for $29.99!! and it is Prime!",positive
Awesome price and quality. Simple and easy to install and fully equipped for installation. If you need a swing arm mount for medium size tv this is one I'd recommend.,positive
"I mounted this in my RV and it holds a 26"" LCD TV / DVD combo.  Installation was very easy and the mount works GREAT!  I was prepared to pay 5 times the price for a mount that would work as I wanted.  I couldn't be happier.",positive
Got my TV mounted with this above my PC and its been on the wall for a year now. No problems with it holds the TV well and its study. Way cheaper than store bought and its perfect for what I got i got a 37 inch HDTV,positive
I really like the action on this mount.  I purchased a 27&#34; monitor for my wife and this mount really frees up the desktop real estate.  I would purchase again.,positive
"I have an older very heavy 36&#34; Samsung High Def TV that weighs substantially more than my new 42&#34;. I replaced my old basement CRT tv with it, installed the VideoSecu mount easily and it does the job. I was amazed, the price from Amazon was only $30 dollars and with prime I got free 2 day shipping. The original price was $149. Wow, what a reduction!",positive
"Used this for a Panasonic 32"" LCD TV.  Mount works fine, instructions were minimal.  I was able to use the supplied hardware to attach the TV and to attach the mount to the wall.  I did have a problem hanging the TV, per the instructions you have to mount the unit and now attach the TV, this was not very easy so I removed the mounting plate at the pivor point and took it off the wall mount, mounted this on the TV and now re-attached to the TV mount, this was a lot easier.",positive
"The product is good and as described.I have a 32&#34; Vizio TV and somehow, this wall mount seems to be a little too weak for my TV. I still managed to mount my TV just fine, but gets a little paranoid that it will give in within the next few months because the mount won't be able to carry it.But the full motion swing feature is amazing! Especially if you are in a larger room.",positive
"The TV is still hanging from the wall so that's a good thing. The info for this wall mount says it is good for up to 66 LBS. Our old Phillips 37&#34; flat screen weighs 58 LBS (including the stand) and after 3 weeks the TV and mount are secured to the wall via a vertical 2 x4&#34; frame member. The mount came with almost every imaginable combination of nuts, bolts and spacers and straps to fit various size and brand TVs. I had no problem coming up with the right combination for my big and heavy old Phillips.",positive
"Bought this mount for a 32inch Panasonic LED TV. The mount may look cheap, but I found it to be extremely sturdy and a great buy for the price. I strongly recommend it to everyone.",positive
"Good, strong mount and quality hardware. Includes all the different size screws required to attach to TV if yours doesn't have them (or if you lost them).  There is just the right amount of resistance in the joints for it to stay where you want it but still easy to move around.  I mounted a shelf above the TV to get the cable box out of the way and avoid having to run a long HDMI cable through the wall.I took a star only because I received a different unit than the one pictured, It has 2 thick arms, rather than the 2-1 that is shown.  Honestly I think what I got is more attractive, but I believe that Amazon vendors should not substitute different products without authorization.  My unit also did not come with the extender arms in the picture, it has a mounting plate with all of the VESA mounting holes in the correct configuration.  My TV is 26&#34; so it fit perfectly.  I am sure my 55&#34; would fit on it too, but I have a different mounting configuration for that one.",positive
"Very solid...we mounted our flat panel in the bedroom. Like the tipping feature and love the articulating feature.We checked prices at stores, big boxes, etc. best price of all including Costco...",positive
I bought this tv swing arm mount for my tv from amazon.Its been a good one its built heavy duty to hold pretty big tv .I would have anyone of my friends buy this same mount for their tv. It lets you hang it up and out of the way and also you can turn it out or in adjustable to see it from anywhere I set in my living room. This unit is easy to mount on wall and put together by yourself but if you have an extra person around it would make it a little better when holding the tv up when it clips in at top then screw and tighten and adjustments and like everything else I've bought from amazon it ships fast right to your door step.,positive
Easy to attach. Easy to adjust. Very Solid and secure. Used on a clients 29&#34; LED with built in DVD.,positive
I have my 32 inch Tv on the wall and it works great. Easy to install and came with all the parts. The screws that it comes with for the TV will not fit but you can buy some for 2 dollars.,positive
"For the money you can't go wrong. Yes, it has a litlle play in the mechanism but, you can adjust your mounting to accomodate that. It works great and frees up counter space. I would do it all again. Why spend 3 times more.",positive
I love this mount! All the adjustments for tilt and extension are awesome! Holds a Sony 32in Ex-3000 just fine even fully extended. Even bought another. A++Mike,positive
"My students and I used to huddle around laptops to discuss projects. Now I have a 47&#34; TV for display and this mount makes it possible to put it on any wall and swivel it in any direction depending on how many people need to see the screen. Really stable, no wiggling",positive
"It is a good value, but is not top notch quality. If you extend both arms in the same direction, the TV (30 inch) tilts. However if the arm goes right, then left, the play in the hinges offset each other and it works great.",positive
"The mount itself seems fine, it just didn't work with the Phillips tv we bought....the 'x' arm things did not line up and if they did then the 'x' parts would have covered the holes for the inputs...........we ended up using one we had had around here.......seems to be built well though and sturdy",positive
"Got this to replace a Peerless Paramount wall mount when I got my new TV.  Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench.Three stars for ease of installation, five stars for usability, for a combined four stars.  Make sure you get help when installing.",positive
"It is up know and should work fine, but it was hard to get it to fit my TV due to the bulge on the bottom, but I made it work and it is on the wall.",positive
"Very strong for any tv, but I wish that it was little longer I am very happy with it and very strongly recommended.",positive
"Easy install!! Looks great and works great for what we need!! Purchased for game room, took 5 min. to install and 1 min. to set TV on. Great!!",positive
"The mount works, but it is unrefined compared to other brands out there. Purchased because it was on sale. just ok.",positive
"I consider myself to be a good DIYer. I've installed mounts for my 2 Samsung 46"" and 55"" LED TVs with no problems for 5 years. So, for this VideSecu mount, inspite of poor installation instructions, I carfeully measured all domensions to fit my new 32"" Samsung LED SmartTV in a limited kitchen space. My mistake was, based on the diagrams, I assumed that the length of both the swinging arms of the mount (the single and the double arms) were of the same length. What a disaster! After installing the mount when I mounted the TV and folded the arms the TV did not center itself to the wall side of the mount! It was then that I noticed the inner length of the 2 arms is about 4"" longer than the outer single arm. In other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my TV was not centered in the limited space that I had and looked awful. I don't know why the manufacturer did not keep both arms the same length. At least they shd have mentioned it in the instructions.This to me is a major product defect. Luckily with Amazon I was able to return this mount but had to pay return S&H;.",positive
Works great for a cheap mount. Worked great on a 32&#34; Emerson LCD tv. Does everything as advertised! Can tighten or loosen joints for easier movement.,positive
We needed something to Extend our tv away from the hot pipe for the winter and this wall mount did the trick. It went up with no a problems. It worked out very well!,positive
We needed a wall mount for a 32&#8221; TV that was going to be in the screened in porch.  This was one of the brands recommended by the guy that was going to install out wall mount.  I can&#8217;t speak to the ease or difficulty of installation but it looks great and we can swivel it if necessary for best viewing angle.  It's also pretty sleek so it doesn't butt out too much.  It arrived quickly and it didn&#8217;t take the installer long but of course he was a professional.  Looks great!,positive
It works for the tv I bought but I had to use some of my own washers for the screws.  I thought it would have everything.,positive
"I have mounted a 42 inch old LCD. Easy to install. Easy to swivel, there is tilt option but it has to be locked by nuts(it can not be changed without loosing the nuts).",positive
I wanted to put my mac in the wall and leave it. This does that well.  I don't move it often it seems strong and well built. If you want to move it a lot get something different you have to keep an Allen wrench and a crescent wrench in the desk drawer if you plan on moving it a lot. The articulation is sketchy. For my uses and the cheap price this was perfect.,positive
"I have purchased a total of 4 HDTV wall mounts from the VideoSecu companyand they are all quality products at a very reasonable price.-Tilt TV Mount: for stationary TVs up to 65 inches.-Articulating:  corner mount for SMALL TVs-Long Arm:  corner or high mobility mount for LARGER TVsAll of them are excellent products, and very easy to install.",positive
"Received this item quickly and well packaged (But not so well that I was infuriated trying to open it)Everything was in perfct order. Strong, handsome appearance. Installation Kit is perfectly in order and gives a ton of options for different senarios.  Couldn't possibly be happier with this product.",positive
"Could offer a little more in flexibility of installation, but once in place the set can be placed in just the right position repeatedly.",positive
The directions stink. Just remember the spacers go under the arms if you have to use them and you will be ok.,positive
It is better than spending twice the money on this going into a brick and mortar store. Was very pleased.,positive
"Good quality.  Must mount on a stud.  I mounted to a metal stud by cutting a rectangle hole in wall, adding a 2 ft 2x4 in the metal stud track, patched the hole and then put up the mount.  Holds a 37&#34; TV without a problem,even added a DVD player to the bottom of the TV and it is still on the wall after about 8 months.  Price on this item was great and it was sent with FREE FREIGHT!",positive
This worked perfect.  The universal design would fit 99.9% of the TV's as advertised.  Easy to mount and very durable.,positive
"I have a full 42&#34; HD flat screen mounted on this. Not only does everything look better than strapped to a table, but the adjustability makes this mount a pleasure to have.  It was simple to attach to the wall and has a small footprint, being a single stud wall mount.  The other major point of this mount is how many sized TV or monitors the mount can be adjusted to accept.  My TV mounts solidly and the mount itself is solid, yet adjusts with little effort.  This is just plainly a good and solid product that is well worth the money.",positive
"had a couple of guys put this up for me, but they said it was easy to install. I like the fact that I can move it around easily and tilt it anyway I want it to be.",positive
This product is user friendly and versatile.It is easy to install and comes with everything needed for installation.Adding bidding could drill and bit,positive
it was so easy to install.  the instructions were simple and so was the process.  i was putting off the project for fear.  i should have hung the TV long ago.,positive
works great was pretty easy to put up and does the trick. it is my sons room and really works great.,positive
"I am very happy with this affordable wall mount for my Sony 32"" Internet TV. One nice feature ist that you can swivel the mounted TV depending on where you are seated.",positive
"I have a 26"" LCD monitor mounted on unit.Seems sturdy enough, would prefer a more fluid motion and a way to adjust the pivot of the screen without tools.  As it is I keep it loose and it is reasonbly adjustable.For the price I certanily can't complain and would recommend this unit.",positive
"Easy to install, and works great. Television moves with ease and always feels secure. Doesn't loosen over time like other television mounts.",positive
This was for a 32 inch LCD.  Easy to install and works great.  I am very satisfied with this wall mount.,positive
"Fits many different size TV's,  is very solid, and was easy to install.  I would recommend to anyone is even slightly handy.",positive
"I'm using this with my 32"" tv and I love it. The price is significantly lower than what you can find for monitor wall mounts in the retail stores (walmart, best buy).I found this to be an easy install and very secure. The swivel is smooth and I can orient my television perfectly. It also has plenty of VESA mount patterns so it will hold just about any TV.",positive
"For such a cheap mount, it works well. I installed in in about 20 minuets and use it to hole a 32"" Vizio LED.",positive
"This was a present for myself, my son installed it, in about 25 minutes, and I couldn't be happier.  I wasn't sure this was for me as it for my bedroom, but my husband and I love it.  So easy to move the TV no matter where you are in the room.  A great buy.",positive
Mounting the TV after mounting on wall can be a handful.  It would have been nice to have some type of slide in mount for the TV so you did not have to hold it while putting in 4 screws.  That would make DIY one person installation easier.,positive
"When we first bought our bedroom tv, we looked at the mounts in the store and almost fell over from shock at the prices.  This is one of the best prices I have found on mounts.  This mount went up easy and moves in all directions to get the perfect viewing angle.  it comes with everything you need but the drill and tv!  You won't be disappointed with this brand.",positive
"If I need to order another, this will be the one.  I used this to mount a TV to the wall in my basement and it allows me to pull the tv out from the wall and turn it towards my desk so I can watch TV while working on the PC, nearly a 90 degree angle.  My TV is only a 32&#34; and I could see that this would work up to a 40&#34; or so, but if you don't need to turn the TV 90 degrees, you could get by with a larger TV.",positive
"I was hesitant about mounting my larger flat screen (47&#34; LG) onto the wall - what happens if it falls off!  After looking at mounts at Target and Best Buy that were $100+, would this possibly work?Fast forward...  The mount took about 20 minutes to install (too longer to locate the studs than mount it).  The TV is on the wall and works wonderfully.  Very solid mount and good articulation.My only comments are the cord clips included are very weak.  I will be replacing them with black cable ties.  Also - they do need to have a second locking screw where you hang the TV on the articulating mount - I can wiggle my screen (tilt) by about 1/4&#34; since there is only a screw on the bottom.Overall, I liked the narrow wall mount and the 20&#34; extension.  Definitely would recommend for a TV that is 47&#34;.",positive
"The fact that the pivot point on this TV mount was not built straight caused the TV to tilt slightly when it was swung out.  there is no adjustment for it, so i had to make a choice for the tv to either be straight and level when it was pushed against the wall, or when it was out.  i do not recommend this wall mount.to it's benefit though, it was reasonably sturdy and easy to install.",positive
"Purchased for my sister to hang her TV on a wall and she and her boyfriend reported back to me that mount works great with the 42&#34; Vizio TV she got for Christmas and was up securely in no time.  I looked around in the retail stores and found that this mount was of similar quality at a much lower price.  What can I say, it does what it is supposed to do, was easy to setup, and is of good value.",positive
"This was needed to mount a 32"" LCD that weighs 27 lbs in my bedroom. I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer. I have another 32"" that needs mounted. I think as soon as I click publish for this review I will be ordering another one. If you find yourself reading reviews on TV mounts and you have found this one your search is over, just click buy already.",positive
This is mounted in a doorway between two rooms in my basement with a 40 inch TV attached to it.  I can move it to either room and still keep the doorway open plenty wide enough to pass through.  Perfect for my needs.,positive
"Sturdy and durable craftsmanship. Bought for my grandma in Mexico, had it installed and works great. Has awesome mobility to enjoy your television from countless angles in your room.",positive
If you want a wall mount that is universal and can be moved in all directions this is the one to get.  My 42&#34; Samsung 3D tv mounted easily and the extensions were not required.  I mounted it to a stud and it seems to be very secure.  I am able to swing the tv to watch from my bed or from the lazyboy chair without a problem.,positive
"Great wall mount at a great price.  Already fully assembled out of the box and seems built to last.  I really like the swivel and tilt as we need it when laying down in the bedroom.  Easy instructions (I'm not a carpenter).  I used this on a 32"" Samsung LED TV.",positive
"Very simple set up and ease of installation. I followed the advice of another reviewer and removed the top hex-screw of one of the center connections (thus disconnecting the wall plate from the plate attached to the TV)so that I could install the plate to the wall and the plate to the back of the TV as separate processes. Both simple and quite easy. Then it was simply a matter of slipping the two back together and re-installing the hex-screw. I was able to install a 32"" RCA TV, without any help in less than 20 minutes.Manufacturer provided a good assortment of screws and other hardware, as well as a hex wrench, a small open wrench and a level.",positive
"got this to hang a 32"" sony lcd in my bedroom.  used my stud finder to locate the studs, drilled 6 pilot holes and hung it up.  and extra set of hands is helpful when hanging the mount and mounting the tv.  holes on mount lined up perfectly with my tv.  screws fit just right.no complaints.",positive
used it for vizio 42&#34; tv. easy to install. fit perfectly. what is there else to say? strongly recommend for everyone.,positive
"I purchased this mount for my 37 inch LCD TV.  Installation was easy...  The trouble I encountered was due to a bad wall stud finder.  Make sure you have one when you install this mount because you need to screw the mount into a wall stud or at least have one screw into a wall stud.The arm of the mount sags after I hooked up my 37in. LCD TV to the mount.  My TV is within the weight limit of this mount (less than 55lbs.) but the arm still sags due to the weight of the TV.  I guess as long as it supports my TV, the sagging shouldn't be an issue.  It just looks funny from the side.  I do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break off.Overall, for the price this mount is a great deal and works but I would suggest purchasing it for flat screen TVs less than 37 inches.  I would not hesitate to buy this mount again but for a 32 inch TV at most.",positive
"I thought this was a great value for a wall mount.  I have installed a 32 inch tv in my bathroom with this unit.  It worked well with the Visio TV that I bought.  It looked it it could accomodate many other tvs because there were a variety of holes on the mounting bracket.  Is it the best quality ever, no.  It is decent quality, and it worked well for me.",positive
my tv! Couldn't ask for more. Thanks. These reviews require too many words. I could have said what I meant in three.,positive
"This TV mount is easy to install.  Just follow the directions included.  I installed this near the ceiling and I'm using every bit of the 15 degree downward tilt.  Properly installed, the product is rock solid.  I installed a 32"" tv on it.  I know it can hold much more.  The articulating arms are easily adjustable and if you want to tighten it down and lock it in position you can do that, too.",positive
"This is the second VideoSecu product I have ordered. They are rock-solid, and with the range of fasteners and extra hardware they include in the package, it's hard to imagine any speaker or TV that these systems won't fit.",positive
"For the price it can't be beat.  The mount is strong and sturdy.  Two sets of hands are mandatory for mounting, three would be ideal.  Once up though, it's better than most of our friends mounts.  It has full articulation, and I can swing the arm out and angle it towards my kitchen.  This is highly important while cooking buffalo wings and trying to keep tabs on football games.",positive
"I originally bought this for a Sony 40&#34; TV, but installed it with a Vizio 42&#34; instead.  I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs.  I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.  (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine.  Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.  Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises.  An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount.  If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).  If you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your TV on, save some cash and buy this mount.",positive
I am using this with a 40 inch Samsung smart tv.  The extended bars were not needed.  This is very easy to mount to a wall stud with just two bolts.  Many bolts are provided to fit with your television.  It is very sturdy and able to be positioned in many different ways.  Highly recommended.,positive
"This mount is heavy, strong and already in one piece. Almost no directions were needed. The only issue I would have: After the mount is installed I had to lift the TV to the mount and screw the screws in while holding the TV up with one hand. I checked the instructions to make sure I wasn't being stupid. The directions confirmed to lift the TV and screw in the screws. Other mounts have a bracket installed on the wall and TV, then I just lift the TV and click it right in. The sturdiness of the mount makes up for this defect in my opinion.",positive
"This mount is sturdy, easy to install, and easy to mount the TV to.  The included hardware was heavy duty also.  The action is good, and tension is adjustable.  The tilt can be adjusted by using the knob in lieu of one of the bolts, or locked in place (which makes it more difficult for someone to remove the TV unless they have a wrench with).  I mounted the 27"" TV on our lanai, so a little theft-proofing is a good thing.  The TV is now visible either on the lanai, or from the patio.I RECENTLY BOUGHT A SECOND ONE, AND THEY HAVE CHANGED.  STILL STURDY, BUT LACKING THE QUICK MOUNT FEATURE! NOW YOU MUST HOLD THE TV IN PLACE WHILE INSERTING THE TINY SCREWS THROUGH THE BACK.",positive
I purchased this mount based on others comments beforehand and i appreciate the guidance. The problem with wall mounting flat screen TV's is to make sure the hole pattern of the mount lines up with the hole pattern on the TV you buy. I'm using this mount with a VIZIO E320ME 32-inch and it works perfect.,positive
"I'm using this to mount an older SyncMaster 191T above my desk and was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy it is for the price.  Installation was simple, though I used the screws from the original monitor mount for the plate attachment, as none of those included would work with my monitor.  The tilt mechanism requires loosening a bolt and then adjusting the monitor to the desired angle.  I would have preferred another 10-15 degrees of vertical tilting capability, but what is available will be fine for most applications.  I posted a couple of photos that shows it mounted.Overall I'm very pleased with the purchase and would buy again should I need to mount another small display.",positive
"Its sturdy, holds my tv really good, its adjustable & really really easy to install. An excellent product. I would definitely recommend it.",positive
"I got this for mounting a tv on the wall in my home office. Price was good and it worked. The adjustments on it work well, and it has a gizmo to hold the cables in place. Don't hesitate to buy. I think I am using this with a 38&#34; tv.",positive
I have this wall mount installed outside. I have a 32&#34; hanging on it in my backyard. Easy to install and have had no problems what so ever..,positive
This unit has worked perfectly in holding a 40&#34; TV in an extended position for months - without sagging or failing.  Very happy with the purchase,positive
"Unfortunately, I'm returning this mount.Though I like the look of it, particularly the two part plastic piece that clips to the wall mount portion to cover the bolts, I feel that the one I ordered wasn't well made.I purchased it to mount aLG 26LE5300 26-Inch 720p 60Hz LED LCD HDTVin our kitchen.The mount arrived quickly and was well packaged. Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. TheVideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1USgets very high marks from me. It's basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 VESA head on it. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.I understand that it's a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement. However, I just can't give this mount any higher rating than I have.",positive
"I must admit, I'm very cautious of what I buy especially when I've seen this identical bracket in the electronic stores priced three to four times than this one.  Bracket arrived much faster then what Amazon estimated and was well packaged.  The directions were adequate but I'm very mechanically inclined so used them as a quick guide and had this bracket installed with my Sony 37"" LCD in under a half hour.  My hats off to the marketing folks with this manufacturer as they did their homework and included additional hardware and brackets to meet any possible configuration out there.  Including mounting tools and level were also an exceptional idea.  And tossing in a 7' HDMI cable was the icing on the cake.",positive
"If less money had been spent on packaging and more on quality, it might be a good product.The product was double-boxed.  The included level was broken. I would prefer to use my own level and have good hardware instead of junk on both counts.  One of the pivots on the arm was so badly rusted out of the box it seemed to compromise the whole system.  Despite 6 huge lag screws and strong arms, the joints are not strong enough to keep the mount level as it extends and articulates.  Each time I moved it it had to be re-adjusted to be level.  The hardware had to be tightened so much to keep it from wobbling, it made moving it very difficult.  I used a 26"" tv.The whole thing went back in the box for a refund.",positive
I bought this mount for our bedroom in order to swing and tilt the TV based on our viewing angle.  In order to move it I had to loosed the screws each and every time.  I had it connected to a 27in vizio LCD which is pretty light.  Could not find a tension to keep it where we wanted it.  Had to return,positive
"Worked great. Easy mounting and setup. 2007 Vizio 42&#34; LCD hung perfectly. It is a heavier TV, around 50lbs and it mounted up great.",positive
"received the product and got it installed today. for the most part I am pretty happy with the hardware except the materials being used to make screws or other parts. the screws get very easily damaged by the most commonly used screw drivers that you can find for $1 per piece.  Once I put the bolt into the LCD TV and mount it with the plate, I found myself having a hardtime removing the screw because the tread mark on the screw head is already messed by by the screw driver, which makes me doubt about the material being used on the mount and arms.  is the material used on the mount going to deliver the same quality as the bolts and nuts?",positive
"Mounting a 42 inch LG TV weighing 33 poundsPROLess expensivePrevious purchase of VideoSecu productAppeared solid and strongHad tilt and various adjustmentsMount on single studCONSagging..this is amazing that it sags and does so at different angles based on how far the TV is pulled out from the wallTherefore one cannot keep the TV properly aligned because any movement changes the tilt or other angles.Mounting is a pain because the mounting bracket never comes apart from the articulation armCritical bolt attachment for the mount from the TV to the articulation arm does not get tight!  This is amazing. It is not stripped but it does will not stay tight even from the first use.  This makes the product unsafe.I am amazingly frustrated bordering on angry because of the time put into this and now holes in the wall.  I need to get a different one.  My prior experience was with a VideoSecu MW380B TV wall articulating mount, which is far superior for a larger TV.  I bought this other one because I wanted a tight fit to the wall.Can I send a bill for my time and work putting it up and taking it down?????",positive
"The Nook Tablet, in both the 16gb version and 8 gb version, are the best color e-readers of 2012.  Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a ""Brand X"" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as ""Automobile"" or ""National Geographic"".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines ""pop"" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special ""text only"" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook ""shop"" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get ""right"", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the ""book world"" and the ""video world"". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a ""book of the day"" for adults and a ""book of the day"" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was ""Mary Poppins"", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out. Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.",positive
"I saw this product on Amazon and thought ""what a great deal"" because this is a 16GB version of the same tablet that Barnes & Noble is selling for $250 dollars.It mostly works, and the screen is great for reading books.  I have had problems with the browser since 2 weeks of owning and the Apps have issues loading and playing some games.  If I could, I would return this product and just pay out the money for a brand new one.",positive
"Now I have like four different kendels and I am such a Fan.  My darling Daughter n law requested this.  No way, says I.

Only cause she gave me the worlds best gran babies ...and I guess I love her like mad too.",positive
"this is excellent tablet, excellent touch screen response and button controls. When you hold it in your hand, you will feel that its built tough and can withstand rough handling(my 17m old tosses it sometimes out of excitement and its still holding good). Battery is also good, last about 8+ hours; the old drawback is that there are very limited apps on Noon web, but I heard there's a way to sideload adds from Amazon that I haven't tried yet. But yes, I would highly recommend it.",positive
"I love nooks. Kindle fire is OK, but nooks are easy to root and install cyanogen mod foe a full android experience.",positive
"I bought this for my husband for his birthday after trying it out in BN and seeing how amazingly responsive it is. I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more ""manly"" looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one  on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway. He also dowloaded Kingsoft Office and now uses this for work as well. Unbeatable hardware at an unbeatable price.... and don't let the restrictive stock software stop you from buying it... just go around it!!!",positive
"When B&N; designed this one, they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features. As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap. Otherwise, it'd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more full-featured.",positive
"this is such a great tablet. one time didn't work. acted weird really weird. needed to be cleaned. now I keep eyeglass cleaning clothes (disposable) for it. has worked like a charm since. hooks up to the computer without the shelves going away. book reading is great too. I use it for an ereader with games that I sometimes play, but mostly as an ereader. recommended.",positive
Great product  works just as described have had no problems with it since I got it thanks for a great product,positive
"Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for ""My Stuff"" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, ""Wow! it's as good as the Sony!""  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not ""locations"" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.",positive
"I bought this ebook (16G) for my Kindergarten and elementary children to read books on trips and my old child to check email. It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing. The books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books. Apps for children are wonderful. My children love it.",positive
"I pulled the trigger on three of these on pre-order back in November.  I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N;'s app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N; app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&N; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N; app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual ""we got your request and will reply as soon as possible"" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.We finally ""side loaded"" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).I am not one to ""root"" products like these (especially since they aren't ""mine,"" as I won't be the one using them).  As the ""guy,"" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big ""n"" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&N; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N; app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the ""tablet"" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the ""expert"" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.  It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.",positive
"I went to a few places just to try testing them out, best place to test them out first hand was BN. The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.First thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)The 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.Add to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)that pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.Pros:The screen is AWESOME! I use it for reading .cbz comics and .pdf files more than anything. The missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better. Also the response on the touch screen was great.much better response time at turning pages, launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative .cbz support (main reason I bought it)supports almost every popular ebook format except for .mobi (which can be converted to epub or .pdf anyway)good size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight (under a pound)battery life... 11 hours+ with wifi off, 8+ with it on, I tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me.a test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and dont scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.also if you buy it from BN you can buy an 'oops' return warranty (which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it, it can be replaced)affordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhileCons:lack of Android Market, lack of some apps I would like to see on the BN market (such as Google Music app) no sideloading apps at the moment either. That being said, this also means that apps available from BN will actually work with your Nook, there isnt a quantity over quality in the app store either. This means that if you've bought an app from Android market, you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the Nook.The screen. trust me, I love it. But unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass, on the Nook if you crack it, the screen is toastno front facing camera (or any camera for that matter). The ability to use Skype would have been nice, but wasn't a complete necessity. I've had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once, and thinking about it, I wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that I will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on, like Starbucks or the libraryno bluetooth, which to me didn't matter, but it seems to be an issue for some people. There IS bluetooth, but it's disabled and there isn't a way to enable itno GPS, this would be nice, unlike bluetooth, I would actually use it.mono speaker instead of stereo, again seems to be an issue for other people, I plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when I'm on the road though and its just fine. I use headphones if I'm out and about. Why on earth would I care about speakers that I never use anyway?no .flac support. a good chunk of my digital music now is .flac. it does have .ogg support thoughno .avi support. again, a massive portion of my movies etc are all in .avi format. It does have .mkv and .mp4 support though, so from here on out I will just have to rip my video files in those formats if I plan on watching them on it.lack of decent accessories selection. lets face it, the case market seems to be geared toward people that worship at the church of Steve, and the availability of accessories shows it.",positive
"And what is it? Why it's an outdated B&N; Tablet! A friend of mine purchased this after seeing my 9in HD+ tablet, but wanted the smaller 7in version. It works fine for what it is, but it caused her much confusion as it did not seem ""as nice"" to her as my 9in concerning screen quality.And that's because this is not the NEW Nook HD with a 1440X900 screen resolution and upgraded hardware, firmware, and software which has been on sale everywhere since the B&N; Father's Day Sale was extended indefinitely. This is the OLD Nook color with a standard 1024X768 resolution screen and minus the upgraded hardware and OS.IOW this is the old model :)So if looking for that ""new, on sale"" tablet by B&N; like my friend was, well, this ain't it. She will be returning hers and getting what she wanted initially.As for this one it looks fine and works fine for what it was, but comes up short these days, period.",positive

And I'm happy to say this Barnes and Noble is the best I ever invested in the picture and color is beautiful. Let's put it this way my niece that has the kindle was checking out the Barnes and Noble nook and compared it to her kindle said that the Barnes and Noble Nook has a clear picture than her kindle and more apps!!! And I told her I did my homework and looked this Nook up and it had the best reputation as far as for a kid,Young teen, Best nook ever invested in money and used at that but I will only order used if the item says like New with original Box with Accesories . And  I will only order anything used through EZ CORPS!! Best company to ever order anything from on Amazon fast professional customer service and love there shipping and handling !! And there all there used products are tested before selling which is a plus.

"I could not be more pleased with - or impressed by - the Nook Tablet! I know that Amazon is ""enemy territory"", but the NT does a much better job of meeting my needs than would a Kindle Fire.Not only can I use my NetFlix account but I also have full access to the Amazon Prime website to watch films and videos!The screen is incredible - bright and colorful and very fast due to both the fast processor and the full Gig of RAM. I popped-in a 16G micro SDHC card and have more than enough room for my entire library of sideloaded epubs, pdfs, mp3s, and mp4 videos.And, of course, the primary use: It's now much easier to read in bed at night. The backlit screen means no more glare from an external reading light.",positive
"I have tried the IPad, the Kindle, and the Sony, and nothing has worked better than this Nook Tablet. It's light, the screen resolution is amazing for movies, and the applications I use work beautifully. Even the speakers are excellent for what they are. No complaints at all.",positive
"Nice specs with nice screen. Not worth the price with just the stock operating system, might as well save the bucks and buy the cheaper color model. You cannot use the larger 16gb internal memory to load your own files as the bad boys at B&N; restricts your access to only 1gb of that memory. UPDATE: Because of the unhappy owners B&N; will relax this restriction when you take the unit into their store and reserved space will be changed so you get 8gb free space.As is, the unit is SEVERELY crippled from making full use of its outstanding specs. Turn this baby into a great Android tablet by ""rooting"" it - easily and painlessly done by buying one of those SD card based kits. I got a 32 GB card with the root kit and I now have full access to Android apps with the ability to revert back to stock is if desired. You can now get all these capabilities on a really good performing tablet for well under $130 (like new used) but remember you get a unit that's a generation old and doesn't have bluetooth, gps, and hdmi out like most other newer tablets have.",positive

"I'm happy, satisfied and proud of myself by selecting such a wonderful tablet like my NOOK.  Honestly it worths more than a five star rating.I will recall a phrase in a movie, it came to a certain point when I had to decide between style and substance...That's right! I got both on this Tablet.The product arrived two weeks ago, I did charge the battery and afterwards registreded the product so I immediately starting getting books, nowadays I have plenty of Nook Books to read ahead.My co-workers and friends love the aesthetics of the Nook look, as I love all the features in the device.Pros: All of them.- The screen is so clear (""Wows!"" me all the time), fast response to tasks, easy menu, fast processor, Micro SD card slot added 32GB extra fun (big smile), lightweight, long life battery. etc.Cons: None",positive
"The Nook Tablet is a solid hybrid tablet/eBook reader.  It excels at eBook reading, and has many functions as a tablet as well.  This is a minor upgrade for Nook Color owners, but a major upgrade for those going from the Nook or Kindle eInk display reader.Pros:7"" VividView IPS touchscreen, bonded for glare reduction.  This is the best IPS screen on the market in this class of device.MicroSD card slot, for up to 32GB of extra storage.Built-in Microphone for voice recording, particularly usefull to ""read"" books to your children without having to physically be there.Reliable Wifi card.1 GB built in RAM for smooth, fast video.Netflix and Hulu.eReader bests the competitions.Easy to root, if that is something you would do.Cons:It's $50 more than some low end hybrids.Much like the other low end tablet's, it runs on Android, which is not the best tablet experience.Limited apps, although the list expands almost daily.Overall, this is a great device and although it is $50 more than some of the competitors models, it is also a far more refined product which doesn't have many of the problems of the others.Highly recommended!",positive
the nook color is a great tablet. it sometimes is very slow but it is still a good tablet. i have dropped it a few times and it is still okay.,positive
"For the price this is a great tablet. It lacks a camera, GPS, and bluetooth, but that still leaves a lot, between web browsing and running lots of Android apps. Barnes and Noble did cripple these with limited software through their store but I did get around that by rooting mine.That said, I was sort of surprised to see this pop up as something recommended by Amazon today. The newer version is faster, has a higher resolution screen, is lighter despite same screen size, and has bluetooth. (Still no camera or GPS). B&N; also is now allowing access to the Google Play Store. It is available on the newer version but I don't know if they updated the software for this one to allow access. I suspect they didn't but this would be something to check on if considering purchasing.If you want a tablet for web browsing, checking email, ebooks, video, and many other apps and this is as much as you want to spend, then it isn't a bad deal. I would recommend paying more for the newer version--the Nook HD. (They also make a version with a larger screen, the HD+)Also note that there are third party programs available which will allow you to boot a rooted Android system off of an SD card. This will give more options but I found the original Nook Tablet to be sluggish running off such a card--possibly because I also went to Jelly Bean and this might have been too much for the older tablet. I wound up going back to running the rooted software directly off the tablet (but rooting is more work than inserting a card). The HD works well off a rooted Jelly Bean card.",positive
"I have used several different 7 inch tablets. The best I used was the Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus. This is a less expensive tablet and very, very good. But rooting the Nook Tablet made it great.That is a fairly easy thing to do with a bit of patience and reading. There are step-by-step videos on how to do this and links to necessary files. All you need to get you started is Google ""root Nook Tablet"". Yes, when it is rooted it does void the Nook Tablet warranty, but it can be unrooted without problems.The screen is beautiful, it is fast and with the micro SD card slot, has plenty of room for storage. I bought my 16gb for $229. A great tablet for the price and I use it every day. Great purchase.The Galaxy Tabs are noted for audio quality and, of course, have some features that can be useful.

"Just picked up a refurbished Nook Tablet from newegg's website and its amazing. Only has a 1024 x 600 pixel screen but from a foot away you can't tell the different between this and a device with 1200 x 800 pixels or more. Reading is a pleasure. I've had all the Kindles and all the Nooks and for the best overall reading experience the Nook is better.Why? The Nook devices feel great to hold. The plastics are soft, all the buttons are in good places, and recharging takes no time at all. Also, the software layout and navigation is easy and logical. Next, the font choices, sizes, and other personalizations are all useful. And finally, no freaking ads. You can personalize your home screen and on the Nook Touch you can select your own photos for the screen saver.What's my problem then with Kindle? Couple things. The ads of course. Also, I personally don't care for the software. You are stuck in their software with no way to personalize it. Boring! Also, the buttons are in bad places so you can accidentally shut the device off. On the lower priced Kindles the font choices are fewer and the smaller size choices are useless unless you use a magnifying glass. And the devices aren't as nice to hold. At least on the Fires they took the idea from Nook on making the backs have a soft plastic.I'm pretty sure that anyone who takes the time to try both Nook and Kindle will like the Nook better. As reading devices go they just make more sense. As far as a full fledged tablet goes you'll have to look to Apple or Samsung in my opinion. Matter of fact I am writing this review on my iPad and shortly I will go back to reading on my Nook Tablet.",positive

"I was looking at expensive tablets that were more like mini notebook computers. I already have a high end notebook. I wanted something that was very portable and not combersome to take on trips, go to coffee shops and etc. I wanted the ability to get email, do limited surfing and read books. The Nook works flawlessly and the display is really nice. I have an N protocol router and the Nook is quick on the Net. I read some negative reviews here. They appear to be written by folks who want to take a $200 unit and turn it into a $500 unit with various apps and other applications. Here's a news flash for the naysayers. Go out and buy the $500 unit and quit complaining. If you want to read books, surf and get email, you'll like this unit.",positive
"Update 2-Sep-13:Put on CM 10.2.2 (Android 4.2.2) last week.  I've got to say, it's nice.  Fonts are small, though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues (google this).  Netflix works, and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior, battery life is same as CM7.  In general I like it better than CM7.  My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes, no BT, no GPS.  Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.At this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.===========================Update Jul 2012: I've installed Cyanogen 7, which works with button savior.  I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card.  Fonts are sometimes a bit big, as is line spacing, but in general, CM7 frees you of the B&N; walled-ness, even as somewhat mitigated below.  Netflix doesn't work, and Google Chrome won't run on Android 2.3.  Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.===========================Original review, Dec. 2011.===========================First I give a summary, followed by the details if U are interested.  I hope people will read reviews here, as, if you say much at all on B&N;'s site, they don't post your review and don't allow you to modify it so that U can post it!:A Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to:-  Read ebooks purchased from B&N;-  Browse the web on a tablet-  Play a small selection of games, having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple pricesGet something else or modify it if U want to:-  Buy a full selection of games/apps-  Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad, Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.-  Play music where U can sort by artist, album, genre, etc.-  Play mpeg videos-  Watch YouTubeIf U are willing to do a bit of work, you can do all this by modifying the device.  I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months, before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it.  This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it's essentially a normal 7"" Android tablet now.The Details:============My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011.  She'd been saving for an iPad (~$500) but at the rate she was saving, we took pity after a year and a half.While she does read (and so do us parents), she also wanted to use it as a music player, and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car, on a plane, etc, and she wanted to play some games.I did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $150 or so.I read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time, and no micro SD slot.  A deal-breaker.  This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab, Nexus, etc.  Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot, we went to a store to take a look.  Sales guy was good, and the device hardware shows well.  Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup, we found the first of our issues:Issue #1: Onboard Memory========================Of the 16GB of storage, you can only place your own items in 1GB.  The rest is for B&N-purchased; content.  1GB is not enough for a music collection, or any significant amount of video.  A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking, having read about this ahead of time.Once she unwrapped it and we set it up (easy enough), annoyance #2 showed itself:Issue #2: App prices and quantity=================================2 Examples: Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.-  BN Market: $2.99, $3.95.-  Amazon's Android Market: $0.99 (ad-free), with free ad-supported versions available-  Android Market, $0.99 for either, plus free, ad-supported versions available.-  Apple App Store, $0.99 and $0.99, plus free, ad-supported versions available.YouTube: free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of, not available on the Nook Tablet, not in the Nook store.I didn't buy either game, but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon's Appstore without rooting the device, esp. if it's running v1.4.0 of the software.  I got that working and bought $0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds.  While I was at it, I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them, and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.I wasn't home for Christmas, but I did have my work laptop which has music on it.  I copied some over and began to use the music player....Issue #3: Built-in Music Player Limitations===========================================The built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used.  U can, generally, sort by artist, album, etc, and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white.  The Nook built-in music player doesn't allow sort. For this, I didn't want to buy a music player, so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb's (Android 3.0's) music player, which is free.  Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market.  The problem wasn't quite solved, because changes to the SD card (adding files) weren't recognized.  I tried Winamp, Songbird and Android 4.0's music player when ICS came out.  They had the same issue.  TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time.  I now run Cyanogen, whose music player (modified stock android to add gesture support) works just fine.  They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.This is ironic - B&N; had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version, plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like ""&lt;"", say, and it'll go back a track.  This would be great while driving.(Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which, though I'm not sure, would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to).Issue #4: Built-in Video Player Limitations===========================================I'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials, saving them as mpg videos.  These wouldn't play with the built-in player.I solved this with MX Player, free version, which plays them fine. U can do this only if U've installed Amazon's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market. People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use. No need - just get another video player.  MX Player Tip: brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen, volume on the right.Issue #5: UI Inflexibility==========================U can't add shortcuts to the desktop, and can't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either.  For this, I installed App Manager (tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb, so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market).  This is a fantastic app and I don't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.Also, there's one physical button.  Standard android buttons such as menu (right-click) and back aren't always around in the UI, and holding home doesn't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android.  They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device.  Update after a month rooted: use Button Savior, which gives soft buttons with a flyout.  Once in a while, you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen.  Update post Cyanogen: CM7 can have soft buttons (back, menu, home, etc) displayed all the time, if desired, and has Button Savior installed as well.Issue #6: Can only charge with their charger/cable==================================================Nothing more to say.  BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable.  It charge very slowly, even if it doesn't tell you it is, when connected to a PC because or other charger.  With some irony, B&N; has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage.  If they could charge with any micro-USB cable, they wouldn't have to.  Update post-Cyanogen: With Cyanogen, it charges with any micro-USB cable, though slowly unless it's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.Issue #7: OTA update breaks all the niceness I've achieved==========================================================An OTA update, v1.4.1, will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging.  I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work, but U can't disable OTA updates.  U can if you root, though, so I did, then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually. It'll never auto-update.  Update post-Cyanogen: irrelevant now.Goodness #1: Hardware is pretty sweet=====================================Snappy, installs apps fine, opens them quickly, videos are fairly smooth, scrolling is pretty good (but not as nice as Apple's).Screen is great from angles, clear and bright.It's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.Speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.Goodness #2: the Reading Aspect===============================The reading end of the device is well-implemented, though I give Amazon's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI.  Doing so from the web is also very fast.  A web order using a computer of a B&N; sample appeared about an hour later, but quite snappily when done from the device.Goodness #3: Books with Videos/Sound====================================Yes, these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads. I know. I do like the talking kid's books (reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen, but without the ability to touch words and hear them), and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce.  This is good for cooking!  U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.Goodness #4: Good if U Root it, for $250========================================When rooted, it's a nice tablet + it has the B&N; connection, and it cost $250.  It isn't an iPad (no cameras or BT), and it's half the price.  Update Nov 2012: There are now a multitude of 7"" tablets (ASUS, Samsung, Google) which get my recommendation.",positive
"I own the original Nook e-ink reader and the Nook tablet.  I have been happy with both.  When I read all the wonderful reviews about the Nook HD+ I couldn't wait to buy one.  The main reason that I bought the reader is that my vision has deteriorated over the years to where I need at least 16 point type.  The availability of different sized type on the reader devices is very welcome.  I use the tablet, not only for reading, but to watch Netflix movies while on my exercise bike.  The Nook tablet works okay for that, but the larger display of the HD+ seemed that it would be an improvement.  However, there are several problems with the current edition:There needed to be at least one more font size at the high-end.  I had to choose between too small and too large.The sound level was too low, even with headphones.  I could not find a Barnes and Noble application to provide better control over the volume.  There are a number of third-party applications which used to work on the Nook tablet that are now locked out by the current OS version.So, in spite of the beautiful display, I reluctantly returned the HD+ to my local store.  When planning future upgrades.  I would advise Barnes & Noble to consider the needs of older customers and people with disabilities.  We are not an insignificant market segment.",positive
"Rooted, and cyanogenmod installed, works awesome.  The Nook Tablet has a bit more memory than the original Nook Color, so that's why I got this one.",positive
"The B&N Nook is a great device. The hardware in it makes sure there is no lag or waits while watching videos, reading books, or surfing the web. The builtin apps are great, as well as the overall layout and options. The major drawback is the inability to load 3rd party apps...but roll back to firmware 1.4.0 and load all you want before upgrading. Or root it (although Amazon Instant Video will not work after rooting).",positive
It accepts up to 32gb micro sd cards but does not work properly with a 32gb card. Mine would not boot because the card used too much energy. That was the only issue I had. Customer service told me to unplug the card before booting up and then insert the card. I returned it and purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus.Funny thing is Barnes and Noble rrjected my review.,positive
"Let's just say this will never be iPad or anywhere close to it. That said, it is never meant to compete with iPad anyway! IF you compare this with Amazon's Fire, it's a closer comparison. Frankly, this is better than Fire. Hands down, NT has better hardware specs and it shows when you start browsing internet with heavy imagery or picture ebooks or emags. The complaints about NT's wall-garden OS restriction is very true...so is Amazon's Fire!It's not the end of the world, just root the device and you have in hand a functional tablet for $250 that is rather spiffy. This doesn't get a 5-star rate because 7-inch form factor is the biggest drawback compare to the OS lockdown. Personally, 7-in tablets is too small for serious computing usage. It is a good reading form factor though. I can't give this a 4-star rate because B&N;'s app store is too small...even when rooted, Google's Market Place is filled with crappy-junk apps.",positive
"i got a 16gb microsd off of amazon for under $14.00 and it holds just little over 8k books, it was what swayed be over the kindle fire, that and the 1gb of ram vs 512mb. Now that they released a 8gb nook for $199.00 its price point is on par with the fire, and has the option of expansion, and  a simple hack allows for a custom android launcher, and i can easily install the amazon app store(and kindle app), android market place, and have a very decent wifi tablet, tbh i wasn't much of a analog book reader, but with this little nook tablet i've been averaging a book a week, along with .99-1.99 monthly magazine subscriptions.when the original nook first came out i purchased one and took it back 2hrs later, it was less then what i expected, but i think barnes and noble has come a long way and now this version is very impressive.battery life is decent, depending on your screen brightness preference and netflix usage, unless i am at home, i usually have the screen brightness at little less then half, and wifi off, and get about 6-9hrs of nonstop read time, 3 days of casual reading/standby.",positive
"Great Product, Great Sale, I love this Product, and my children will too I cant wait til Christmas to Give them their present.",positive
"The Nook HD was designed to be a book reader, although it also is a great way to watch videos on Netflix, or listen to Pandora Radio, or to your favorite music. I added a 32gb memory card so that I can have thousands of my favorite songs with me when I travel.The Nook HD has a screen with the best resolution and the least glare and reflection of any color e-reader.  It is the only color e-reader that comes close to the reading experience of an e-ink reader.Barnes & Noble has lots of children's books that take advantage of the Nook's color and audio features.  I bought a Christmas story that can read out loud in English or Spanish, and on each page something would be moving...snow falling, or the moon moving across the sky.The Nook is VERY light, which makes it easy to read for hours, and you don't mind having your Nook with you 24/7 in your purse or ""man purse"" (I use a small laptop bag).The Barnes & Noble selection of e-books is huge, and includes 90% of best sellers.  Each day, there is a ""Book of the Day"" for $2 or $3...many of them best-sellers or classic books.",positive
"I've owned an Ipad 2, an original Kindle Fire, and first generation 3g dual screen Nook. I decided it was time to upgrade my original Nook and went with this tablet. I purchased mine direct from B&N. This is a fantastic ereader with a few tablet functions. I really like the interface on this ereader more so than the Kindle Fire. Don't get me wrong, the Kindle Fire is a very nice device, but I like the personal touch I can give the Nook HD. It's more customizable.I can create my own wallpaper and customize my home screen. The ereader is very light and easy to hold with a contoured, grippy back. The screen resolution is fantastic! Even small print is readable. The colors in magazines is exceptional and the scrapbook feature is an innovative touch. I really appreciate having a physical home button, and external volume rockers & power button. The interface is very user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Setting up email was a snap and customizing my security settings from lock screen passwords to shopping passwords is much appreciated. Web browsing is very zippy on this device. More zippy than the Kindle Fire. Ereading is also a pleasure, with customizable fonts & backgrounds. I was surprised at how well I was able to read on it outside in the shade. It still has a lot of glare, but it is much more readable than the Ipad or the Kindle Fire.I can't see the Ipad or Kindle Fire screen at all outside with all the glare. Nook HD is NOT as readable as an eink screen, so I will be keeping my original Nook of 3 years for outdoor reading. But for a tablet ereader, I was really surprised at how well it did outside in the shade. I have since given my husband the Ipad 2, as I like the 7"" form factor of the ereader/tablet devices. I take them with me everywhere. If you were to ask me which I liked better, the Kindle Fire or the Nook HD...well...I wouldn't be able to choose. Amazon has a larger store for books, apps, movies etc....but I like B&N's Nook HD for it's interface, superb screen and customizable home screen. It also has expandable memory, and you can sideload epub books. I also like the look of the Nook HD better. It would come down to personal preference and which store you have the most investment with. All in all, the Nook HD is a great device that hasn't gotten the attention it deserves, and is worth serious consideration.",positive
"I got this for my little girl, as she filled up her 8gb tablet with games. We just love the Nook HD tablets. The fact they have Google Play, and you can change the background to a nice picture, makes these tablets superior in most ways, to the Kindle Fire. Yes, the Fires have their own advantages (we have some) but overall, we prefer the Nook HDs.",positive
"I tried Kindle hd, Samsung tab 2, and Nexus 7. I returned them all since I had high standard for display quality of tablets. I was very disappointed by their color faithfulness and/or resolution.One day I saw a hot discussion online about discounted nook hd from Staples. I rushed to a local store and played nook hd. Its screen immediately attracted me: bright, white, colorful, high resolution. This is what I want!I have being enjoying nook hd ever since. It has THE BEST SCREEN  period!Online community like XDA forum has ways to root nook hd and install Android by yourself. I rooted mine and can enjoy all apps from Google play store.Even today, I still wow when I read text, view photo, and watch videos on nook hd.",positive
"not so happy with it. I have had my Nook HD for approximately 7 months. During that time, I have ordered 60 books, of which I have read 50. Those read were placed in created Shelf A or Shelf C, depending on whether I liked it or not. Everything was working fine until they did a recent update and then it was like a tornado was let in. Locked up my Nook until I downloaded the update and then found all my shelves gone and books missing from my library. Called BN-shelves gone and will have to create again plus move read books back into and missing books from library have to be downloaded again. One book was not found and after an hour on the phone, BN said the publisher stopped making it available for the Nook (is available for the Kindle) and will issue a refund. Fortunately I kept the email confirmations of all books I ordered so I could give them the order number.Customer service is lacking at BN. I had to make multiple calls until I was finally put in touch with someone who could solve the problem of the missing book.One other thing-update seems to have changed screen brightness as before I could read it out by the pool and now I no longer can.In fairness, I will also mention that I have a Kindle paperwhite and an update wiped out my created collections, but didn't lose any books and can still read it out by the pool.Both have Wi-Fi and that may be an inherent problem with updating through it as far as shelves/collections go.",positive
"The Nook HD is my third Nook device. I like the Nook simple Touch, Nook Tablet because I primarily use it to read books, watch an occasional video (YouTube), listen to music on Pandora, and work a cross-word puzzle or play a game. Because I enjoyed my Nook so much, I decided to purchase the Nook HD because it is much lighter in weight and more compact in size. Now that I have purchased the Nook HD I have some pros and cons about the product. Nothing serious, I will give myself a little more time to get used to it. But I am concerned about the short battery life.Pros: Light weight and smaller than the previous tablet; great video picture quality and the sound is very good even without the earbuds.Cons: I have to get used to the new interface, the previous tablet was easier to use and navigate; when playing games and connecting to the web using wi-fi, I have to charge frequently because it uses up the battery very quickly&#8212;I may have to carry my charger with me; not as many fonts to choose from like the previous tablet.Overall, I am pleased with my Nook HD Tablet. Once I have resolved some of the cons with this product, I will be a little more comfortable with using it on a daily basis.",positive
"It has everything you need in a tablet, except it doesn't have a camera, 3G or GPS, personally I don't need them. But guess what... It is built in microphone.. That is good, I like to sing.O.k. this tablet has a good touch response, you can touch even the smallest links, the screen is extremely crisp and beautiful 900X1440 pixel the highest resolution in the 7 inch tablets!... I was amazed at how beautiful google maps is displayed, I loved it. It has a dual-core 1.3 ghz processor and 1 Gb of Ram, it is quick and very responsive but don't abuse, it is only a tablet.I decided to get this tablet instead of the Asus Nexus 7 because it is lighter, it only weights 11 Oz, this is a good factor if you are planning to use it for long periods of time. I use it for reading colored magazines and illustrative books. Besides it is easy to grip.The battery last about 11 hours if you use it only for reading, and about 7 hrs if you watch videos or use it in wi-fi mode.The new software updates give you access to google Play. It couldn't be easier. You don't deal with any annoying promos and the charger and wire is included.",positive
"Bought a 16 GB one at my local B&N; store, on sale at $119. Fantastic! It is totally Android, hooked right into the Googleplex... like Google Maps, and the Google Play apps store... where, you guessed it, I immediately downloaded the free 'must-have' Amazon Kindle app, perfect! (I might buy the B&N; tablet, but books? Amazon all the way). And free Acrobat Reader, which will still enlarge any vector line art in a PDF to 6400%, just like on a PC/Mac. Note -- Flash and video embedded in a PDF do not play on the Nook, or, to my knowledge, on any other tablet, or on Macs.Let's see. Photos (originals are 1800 x 1200) shown from my Smugmug site are razor-sharp in perfect color on the 7"" Nook screen. I'm an amateur photographer, and it's a joy to see my images displayed absolutely correctly.Other stuff -- it has a microSD card slot so you can bring in your own pix, docs, PDFs, etc. Will buy a microSD card for it tomorrow. As an aside, there's a company called N2acards that sells a microSD card pre-loaded with the Android operating system... but, with the Nook HD 'in bed' with Google, I'm not sure what I'm missing by just sticking with the Nook's built-in system.Anyway, I'm VERY happy with this product. If it blows up, I can take it back to my local B&N; store and get another. And it has a feature where it backs up all your content on Google servers.Lastly, was able to connect it to my Yahoo e-mail account immediately. It also has Facebook and Twitter, but I turned them off as I'm fairly anti-social.",positive
"Had some initial problems, sound output was so low that I could not hear it.  Tech support said to de-register it and reboot.  That cured that problem.  Then WIFI would disconnect without any apparent cause.  Called tech support 3 times, they were helpful and courteous, but we could not solve that problem.  Finally tech support asked me if I had inserted a miniSD card, I had.  They told me to check to see if that it was corrupted, it was.  Re-formatting that card solved WIFI problem, although just why it was causing this problem is still a mystery to me.  If you have problems with your NOOK, and you are not able to solve them, and you have inserted a MiniSD card, try re-formatting it.I have an Apple IPAD, I bought the NOOK to help me learn and understand ANDROID.  I find ANDROID substantially less user friendly, and the apps cost more and do not work as well.  More importantly, at least to me, is the fact that there are at least a  dozen  apps that I use all the time that have no equivalent in ANDROID.  In short, I will not be buying an android phone to replace my IPHONE anytime soon.",positive
"I bought the hd first and am completely in love with it. A very handy size and very responsive. Bought the hd+ for use when size is not a factor. Love both. Added 64 gig scandisk to both. Only real issue is that I run ubuntu, no windows/mac, so had to cobble my desktop and laptop to ba able to download to nook. Can set video downloads to default to sd card. Very happy. Thinking about buying one more of each if the price goes even lower, for backups in case of loss or damage.",positive
I bought the Nook primarily for reading but wanted the HD for email and web browsing also. I was pleasantly surprised at the exceptional screen quality and ease of setup.I did not want to spend the money for an IPAD and now I am glad I didn't as I prefer the Nook interface for reading. The screen brightness can be changed anytime during reading but on the IPAD you have to go into settings after exiting the book you are reading. The only downside is there are not as many apps written for the Nook. I am hoping that will change.,positive
"With all the tablets and apps out we don't really need EReaders anymore.  I am not exactly sure why I wanted a e reader.  I mean,  I have a iPod, iPad, Kindle, Regular Nook,  iPad Mini,  iPhone, Blackberry Playbook.I decided to sell my Kindle Fire and my previous Color nook tablet and upgrade to the snow nook HD and its beautiful,  it also has google apps on here now so we can get a lot of android apps, including the AHEM// Kindle app.I like the nook friends and borrowing books options as well as how clean the OS is.",positive
"If you are looking for a very light and compact device to read your books, check your e-mail and watch movies, you really can't beat the Nook HD. It has the highest screen resolution for its form factor (7"") and is a pleasure to read and write with. Netflix & Hulu+ are magical to view since the resolution is so high and it's so darn light. Being able to expand the memory with a micro SD card is just another plus. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with it an would recommend it highly!",positive
"Why pay to be restricted, I simply didn't see the benefit with all of the other tablets out there having apps that perform exactly the same tasks. Just decided to go a cheaper route and I am so glad I did.Maybe I would consider the Nook again if it is expanded beyond a e-reader.",positive
We have both the hd and the hd+ but I love the hd because it is lightweight and very portable. All my nooks are converted to android and work very well.,positive
"It is too bad that the Nook HD hasn't received more kudos. To be honest, I knew it had a great screen, a fast proce fast processor, great battery life, and oh so light and easy to handle. But, I did wait for a means for rooting the Nook HD to become available. Now the tablet lives up to all its potential. Rooting is quite easy and it is a great tablet",positive
"This is a really nice item. With the way I use it, the battery life lasts for several days of reading and browsing the web. Magazines on this screen are amazing, I especially like reading Time because of the outstanding photography they do. Books look great, and the selection of games on the Barnes and Noble store is alright. A little annoying paying again for games I already bought on my phone, but that's not so bad.Further, you really don't need to pay again for games if you install a custom ROM on an SD card. You can either purchase one premade (google for N2A for more info) or you can burn your own if you google a little more and spend the afternoon trying different things. It's not scary at all, especially since you're only doing stuff on the SD card not the tablet itself. If you want to undo it, just take the card out! Anyway, the custom ROM just gets you stock android, and that opens this great device up to the full android market of games and apps. You can still read all your Barnes and Noble stuff on the B&N; android app. I read my Wired subscription that way, as well as some books. Anyway, I think this device and the ROM on the SD card is the best of B&N; and android.Anyway, I'd compare this with the Google Nexus 7. The nook has a slightly higher resolution screen, which is kinda neat especially for magazines. No front facing camera on the nook, but my phone already is great for video chat so I don't miss it. Also, the custom ROM I put on my SD card is android 4.2, whereas google says the Nexus is android 4.1...maybe they'll get an update soon I don't know. So, either way, you probably can't lose.EDIT: Barnes and Noble opened up the stock software to be able to use almost all of the apps in the google play store. So, I don't use my custom ROM at all, because of the better battery life and just overall fit and finish of the Barnes and Noble stock software. It's a great tablet!",positive
"Mixed up the review to show how the Nook changed with Updates within 12 hours of opening the box.Opened the Nook packaging with great anticipation. The instruction set is barely nuts and bolts but it gives one the essentials.It passed the back pocket test famously. This was done straightaway. Was very pleased with this feature.But buyer beware. I discovered this Nook tablet has no camera at all. Who ever heard of such a thing? There is a reasonable expectation.The Nook downloaded and upgraded itself famously. Everything was smooth and cheerful.The speed of the Nook was very good in my opinion. Page to page was smooth and cheerful and moderately fast. The book pages are easy to read. Another Dan Brown book (I think). Made the discovery with Inferno. Played/watched Linux Action Show and other video for about 3 hours with about 15% of the battery power left.Checked YouTube and Amazon to see the how the graphic's engine worked in the Nook. The motion pictures were crisp and clear on YouTube and Amazon. The sound was very excellent and voluminous much to my surprise. Can hear the device clearly and with ease even though I am kinda hard of hearing. The movie scenes moved like a big computer rendering of the graphics. The motion pictures were like a TV broadcast. Not kidding.Now the ultimate bummer: their much touted microSDHC card can not play your own content downloaded from a computer. Later, several hours later there was an additional patch of 75 upgrades that made the microSDHC capable of playing video files/movies. The selection it can play is very limited compared to other more recent operating systems in Android devices. The latest Android operating system is 4.4 KitKat. The Nook will not play certain AVI or HD files. It is very persnickety  What the Nook can play is rendered exceptionally well indeed. It can only play things downloaded from Nooks libraries for sale-wrong as mentioned. I would have never bought this dohickey if I knew thee was no camera natively in advance.One always takes for granted a camera. And their microSDHC is nothing short of a rip-off. Jeez- wrong now.My Chinese Brand X tablets can play my media content in AVI. MP3/4 and other popular media formats very well indeed. These Brand X tablets can play far more movie/video files than the Nook. Their Android versions are newer than the Nook's.The back pocket thing was a real plus. Great sound. Great graphics. Good speed.But these pluses can not counter balance the negatives. The camera is not as important as real robust motion graphics and awesome sound to me. Now I am thinking I will keep this Nook because it does have a viable if not bugged up microSDHC card port capable of music and motion picture replay. Forget file sharing in Android.B&N; needs a No Brainer award for greed and stupidity just like Apple, Kindle and Nexus. Apple, Kindle and Nexus deserve the No-Brainer award more because the Nook's microSDHC does work but has limited compatibility with the files/apps that can play these type of music and movie files.Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this thingamajig. May keep this on the hope there will be patches further to play music and movie files.If you need a camera don't buy this.",positive
"The Nook tablet is a great color e-reader with the ""bonus"" of being able to read your email, shop on Amazon.com, surf the web, watch tv shows on Hulu Plus, movies on Netflix, and listen to the world's largest selection of music on Pandora Radio.  I added a 16gb sd card filled with thousands of my favorite songs. But, the Nook is designed to be an ereader...it is not a games tablet, or an IPad.I got my Nook Tablet (8gb version) from Barnes & Noble because of the extra discount I got with my B&N; membership...the price was MUCH less than advertised by most internet venders. I already have a Brand X color e-reader and a Nook Simple Touch reader. My old color reader was hard on my eyes for long reading sessions, the Nook Touch is great for books, but it does not have internet access or play music and magazines don't really work without a color screen.The Nook tablet has very sharp, clear, and contrasty fonts and is very pleasant to read, even for several hours. There is a night mode, and also a sephia mode for reading in bed without bothering anyone else. Magazines look great on its color screen. I listen to music on Pandora while I read, and when I am tired of reading, I can watch a movie on Netflix or a tv show on TV.com. I installed the Dolphin browser which uses tabs so I can switch quickly among various web pages.Vevo music videos look great, but the Nook's speaker is too weak to enjoy music. However, music sounds great through good ear buds and when I plug the Nook into my computer speakers.The Nook is an e-reader, NOT an I-Pad or high powered tablet. It does not have access to Google Play to obtain apps, so you are limited to the apps in the Nook app store. Those apps have been developed just for the Nook and its seven inch screen. The apps in Google Play are mostly designed for the smaller screens of cell phones, while Nook apps are designed just for the Nook.Bottom line: the Nook Tablet 8gb is a terrific way to read books and magazines while enjoying your favorite music (I loaded a 16gb memory card with thousands of my favorite songs...transferring the songs over to the Nook from my laptop was fast and easy).For folks who want the ""full"" tablet experience, Amazon.com sells the N2A card which enables you to boot your Nook into a full tablet mode, with access to Google Play, and the 400,000 apps available there. And, the N2A card also permits booting the Nook back into its original Nook settings, as the card does not modify any of the Nook's software or settings.",positive
"Between this and other popular competitors there isn't a lot of difference in hardware.  The software and usability is noticeably different though, and that's where you should pay close attention.  I bought my wife the Nook Tablet for Christmas and she uses it a fair amount.  I haven't heard any major complaints from her but here are the ones I've heard most often.The Barnes and Noble App Store is a joke.  I looked through it for about 5 minutes and barely ever saw a free app.  Many popular apps and games are there, but usually you can only get the paid version.  Adding insult to injury, side-loading is difficult if not impossible without rooting the device (this will void the warranty).  I didn't expect side-loading to be a given really, but if you block those apps you really need a decent App Store to make up for it.The SD card slot, which many people may not ever use, is in a pretty odd spot.  It's not really hard to pry back the cover but since you're working with a micro-SD card it can be really annoying to  line up such a tiny card in the slot.  If that wasn't annoying, it is definitely annoying to load your PDFs or whatever from the SD card once its inserted.  For someone who isn't really tech-savvy it isn't obvious how to read those files.  The reader app could really do a better job of detecting documents when the SD card is inserted.On the aesthetic side the launcher could use some work.  Although I think the scrolling app dock at the bottom is slightly more elegant than a grid-like app drawer, there's little organization to the home screen.  You can drag icons around, to and from the dock, but apps/books don't lock to any kind of grid on the home screen.  Some of us who are more anal retentive just won't stand for two icons being less than parallel.  You can see a better view of your media by opening the Library app, which is a nice app, but I find the contrast displeasing, further emphasizing this is a tablet with e-reader functions (or vice versa maybe).  Basically the cohesion isn't there and you start to wonder, with all of the restrictions, why you didn't just get a regular tablet.I still haven't rooted my wife's tablet but maybe if something annoys her enough she'll let me do it.  Otherwise, if you're not planning to root the NOOK, beware of its restrictions and browse its App Store for a bit to see if the selection and prices are a deal-breaker.  This is an e-reader FIRST and a tablet SECOND.  If you're satisfied with its e-reader capabilities I'm sure you'll be happy with this device.",positive
"Honestly, I was really just interested in getting an ebook reader, so you won't hear me whining (much) about how the Nook's functionality was crippled by B&N.  What tipped the scales towards the Nook (instead of the Kindle, which was the other main contender for my money), was its compatibility with the epub file format.  It's very tightly integrated with Barnes & Noble's store, and as long as you're only interested in either books from that retailer or sideloading your own books via USB cable, you'll be satisfied with this device.  Unless you're willing to root it, you WON'T be able to sideload apps from a computer, and you also won't be able to access Google's Play store or Amazon's app store.  Definitely a deal-breaker if you're looking to buy a fully functional Android tablet, but it works well for my own purposes.",positive
"My nook tablet has really made reading fun again! I was sick and tired of fiddling with reading lights while trying to read in the dark and, after seeing my friend's kindle fire, decided to pick up a tablet for myself. The barnes and noble app market is a bit weak, but I bought my nook to read, so aside from a few games and basic applications its been a strictly literary experience for me. The backlight is great for reading in the dark, and i haven't had any issues with glares while reading in the sun. The stock web browser is fine for basic browsing, but if you're looking for a true tablet experience you might want to wait for the Google Nexus 7 tablet. The nook tablet however, as it stands, is an excellent e-reader/tablet for $200!",positive
"8/2012 - Best screen on a 7"" tablet for the price range. Seriously, iPad quality and even sold my iPad 2 for this! =D Very happy and would not go back.1) Lighter than an iPad. Thus, easy to hold one-handed for extended viewing. Can't with the iPad.2) Screen quality is IPS and matches that of the iPad. No issues with resolution, contrast, color, etc. One of the best screens, esp. for low reflections off a glossy display tablet out there at this time. One of the biggest reasons I bought this. Far less shine than the annoying iPads.3) Nice loop hole for a strap - Wii strap works great! Never drop it again!4) MicroSD card slot! Yes!! Expand and drag&drop; media as you see fit, along with CM7.5) Plays more media formats than the iPad. MX Player pretty much kills the iPad for how easy it is to play everything up to 1080 on this tablet.6) Runs 4-5+ hours easily reading ebooks.In short, for the price range and time of this post, nothing else 'better' for a 7"" tablet. Wouldn't go back to my iPad2 ever, and extremely happy with this - total keeper for all it can do!! xD",positive
"The Nook preformed perfectly and was easy to set up. I checked lots of ratings before I ordered it, and they were all good.This was my first tablet so I did not realize that it did not have some of the specific features I was looking for. I did return it. I must say though that the camera on the Nook was much better than camera on my new one.",positive
"(update) I find my review written about Nook HD included here for an entirely different model tablet. Amazon or B*N this is unethical!D.F.---------------Nook HD overviewGreat screen, no cameras, weak speakers, crappy battery life, compromised android OS, but an inexpensive way to browse web and run the world of android apps on a fast, beautiful display. Plus it has a microSD slot to hold lots of videos for offline viewing. And of course, its original purpose, to provide a slick interface for purchase and reading of magazines and books.PlusesWide range of browers available. I have 9 on my machine. All browsers for tablets have reduced functionality so some browsers are better than others for specific tasks. For example, Firefox will play video in HD and does not redirect to mobile sites. Tint and Zirco have a homepage that will access a local html file. With several browsers installed it's easier to get around site restrictions. Firefox has an addon that auto-deletes cookies. Chrome allows spoken search inputs.The world of 700,000 android apps can now be accessed on Nook HD including big and nice apps: Google earth, Skype, YouTube in HD, Adobe Reader, WiFi Analyzer, WiFi Fixer (essential Wifi tool), Google maps, best solitaire ever (by MobilityWare), and free 'run' games. Custom moving backgrounds on Nook HD home screens are fun.AnnoyancesIn two months I have not figured out how to add a browser link to Nook HD home page. Some browsers have the option to add a link to the homepage, but it never works! (It must be that the Nook HD OS does not allow this)Poor battery life, by test I get only 4 hours.Adroid apps normally just suspend, so it tends to take too many presses and taps to cleanly start an application.Audio does not shut off when you exit most radio and music apps. With no OS support for shutting apps down I often have to resort to a reset to silence them.Built-in email has a short time window so you only see few or no messages. Apps like FastHotMail can provide workaround.Screen capture is clumsy (pushing Home and Vol- requires a lot of force and nearly simultaneous pushes).Nook HD not really useful for music, sans headphones, because sound volume on speakers is relatively low.Setting up icons on home screens is kind of a pain. Half of the main screen is taken up by a carousel that cannot be removed. The Nook recommended way of moving an icon to an adjacent screen is to hold icon overlapping the edge, but I find this hit or miss, it only seems reliable after a reset.File directories can be accessed via USB, but have some annoyances: Many file managers have a hard time finding personal files lost in a maze of OS directories. Nook HD allows deletion of its standard user directories (like 'kids B&N; files') only to later write them back again.Tablet does not reliably remember some settings. Occasionally I find the screen will be dim or the notification is too loud and when I look the setting has changed.No way (that I have found) to add personal data for quick entry.(update)Bluetooth keyboard problem solvedI have an inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with another tablet (Blackberry Playbook), but I could not get it to work with Nook HD. It would pair fine, but nothing happened when keys are hit. I see others complaining of this too. Finally I solved the problem with an app called BlueInput (available on Play Store). It now does the pairing, not Nook OS, and you select the bluetooth keyboard using 'Switch Keyboard' icon.(update)Fix for adding web link icons to the home page. Some browsers have the option to add a bookmark to Home, but this never seemed to work in Nook HD. I think I now understand the source of the problem. The default Nook HD launcher (with carousel) ignores them. The work around is to install the Nova launcher, and it will show them on the home screens.",positive
"If you buy this from a B&N; store, and are a member of B&N;, you can get this for $174, which is cheaper than the 8 gig Fire. If you already are loaded with Kindle books, B&N; foolishly doesn't have a Kindle app, but you can, on Amazon or n2a.com buy an n2a card which allows you to boot your Nook up as a full Android complete with access to the Android Market (or whatever Google is calling it now), and get the Kindle app to accress all your Kindle books.  Since I love the design of the eReader  on the Nook, I use my n2a card only when I want a Kindle book.  I find the B&N; Nook books are usually the same price as Kindle.  Occasionally, Kindle doesn't have a book I want but Nook does.  Also, Nook may not have a book Kindle has.  Also, Nook books have the page perfect series, as well as Enhanced Editions with embedded videos and audio clips, neither of which Kindle has.The Nook has a tab for ""My Stuff"" so you can drag things from your PC to the Nook.  If you want more space for your stuff, you can get any sized san disk for the Nook.  I have a 32 gb one because I transferred about 4,000 pictures to my Nook and am using an app to edit the pictures and then make slide shows of them. Then I'll drag the shows back onto my computer and burn them to disc. Did I mention the Nook is a joy to use? I actually got thre 16gig Tablet but the 8 gig is as fast and has the 11 1/2 hour battery as well as allows the same cards to be added.",positive
"Three of my children are sharing it now. I do not see the need to buy another tablet because I do not allow them to play with it too much. My oldest child uses it for email, news, weather, and more while in school.

My older children would record some of the books for my smaller children to listen. It save me a lot of time to read to them. The dictionary is at their fingers.Not a bad gadget for education.",positive

"I have mixed feelings about the tablet.  I really like and don't like features of this tablet.

Netflix and Hulu are available and app market is expandingDON'T LIKE:1.  no bluetooth or GPS2.  do not have access to the full Android Market3.  no video rental option - apple and Amazon tablet have better market places4.  only 8 GB memory and although it can be expanded with microSD, less convenient than other tablets5.  the e-reader is not as good as a Kindle but then what is?  at least the iPad allows for the Kindle appFor now, I'm sticking with my Kindle Fire over this Nook but I'm keeping my options open for future purchases.",positive
"I bought my 8gb B&N; Nook new for $149.99.  At $200 list price I would say it's a rip-off and I'm still not thrilled that I spent $150 on it.Pros:  Expandable storage via micro-sd.Reliably plays mp4 video and e-book files.Netflix and Hulu Plus apps are reliable and have good interfaces.Reliable (but not particularly long-distance) wireless antennae.Bright screen with good color, contrast, and resolution.Responsive touch screen.Good battery life.Cons:  Web browser is slow, unreliable, and crashes often.Limited, closed operating system with expensive applications.Headphone jack is low-rent - too quiet and scratchy with some of my speakers.Horizontal / Vertical screen calibration lacks enough customization options.Made from cheap plastic - micro-sd cover slot fell off.No way to rent movies or TV episodes from Nook store.Hard-to-use music player that has problems playing some mp3s that other devices can play just fine.It's good as a potable media player but is definitely nerfed as a touch-screen portable computer. If other tablets were priced in the same $150 range I would have rather got something a lot more customizable with access to free apps.",positive

"Pros:The hardware is nice, I have the 8GB - Its fast, responsive and the screen is beautiful. Great for reading books and netflix. Battery life - Read 'Catching Fire' and 'Mockingjay' on a single charge. Email and web are decent too - nothing special.Cons:The B&N; Nook OS and the B&N; App selection are both terrible. The Nook OS is counter-intuitive and not user friendly, there is no BACK button!? Take a toll of how often you use the BACK button on your phone or android device and you'll realize how annoying the lack of this simple common-place feature is. You can hit the 'N' and go back to home any time - though often I wanted to go Back, not start over. The selection of apps in the app store are laughable. I literally could not find a single app I wanted, even searching apps that they advertise like Comics for nook (not installed? not available?). I found a few apps for $4.99+ that i have downloaded for free on Itunes and Google play (android market).Recommendation:BUY THIS -N2A (TM) - 32GB Nook to Android bootable microSD Card for the Nook ColorTakes the Good hardware of the Nook Tablet and replaces the useless OS with trusted Full Android. Read the reviews, they are all true! Before i bought this card, the nook was basically useless and frustrating - now I have an android tablet and since it is NOT rooted, still have warranty too, though I recommend squaretrade. Check my N2A review for more info.Update: I have had this tablet for over 6 months now and love it. I have had no issues and all my friends and family want one. Note: I use this exclusively with the N2A card in Android mode. N2A recently emailed me with the update from Gingerbread to Jellybean and its working great and their customer service is excellent. I cannot recommend this company/product enough.",positive
"It is ok for adults. Fine for older adults who are just looking to use it to read but the place where this thing shines the brightest, it is bomb proof. I gave one to my toddler boys last year and it still works 100%.

A scratch here or there but truely you could never tell what torment this device has been through.I wish I could get an apple device this durable. In the same time that I have owned this tablet my family, (self and husband included) has killed no less that 3 smart phones, an ipad, one samsung device and a dvd player.The device has also survived multiple refreshes and side loading software experiments with out even flinching.I will say that the b&n; app store is pretty pitiful but like I said It's easy as pie to sideload the google play store and have access to pretty much anything you want.",positive

It can also do more than basics.",positive
This nook has a very nice format and is very easy to operate and view.  The only draw back is the Battery life is terrible.  I am charging this unit twice a day.  My former Simple Touch only needed charging once a month &#34;with the wifi ON&#34; all the time.  I would NOT recommend this product.,positive
"If anyone have used previous version of nook you will immediately see the improvements on new version of nook. One of the most important feature I found on the new nook was better page turn response. The screen refresh when moving from page to page is much quicker, nearly matching the refresh rates of the latest Kindle. The Nook also added a laundry list of interface and usability improvements, such as the ability to organize your book collection by category which is called ""shelves"".I liked 600 X 800 display screen. It comes with 16 shades of gray and is easy to your eyes. I can read all day without hurting my eyes. My personal opinion, i would love this device more if I could read it at night without lights.ProsLibrary with thousands of books, magazine that comes free, built-in free wireless data network, plus Wi-Fi connectivity (no PC needed); separate capacitive color touch-screen pad for navigation, and a virtual keyboard for notes and annotations; 2GB of internal memory (capable of storing 1,500 electronic books) as well as a microSD expansion slot for additional memory; font style and size are adjustable; displays image files and plays MP3 music files; compatible with Windows and Mac machines; battery is removable and user-replaceable; allows free browsing of full-text books while within Barnes & Noble stores; you can lend certain e-books for up to 14 days free of charge; EPUB format compatibility lets you read free Google Books and loaner e-books from your local library; page turn speeds are faster with firmware upgrade.The bad: No protective carrying case included; color LCD ( for color nook)  has an impact on battery life; for black & white battery is really good,in-store reading and loaning capabilities come with notable limits and caveats; no support for Word or text files; no ability to download books when outside the U.S., even when on Wi-Fi.Does it beat Kindle?According to design my answer is no.  The third-generation Amazon Kindle is lighter, thinner, and simply feels a little better to hold in your hand. It also offers double the battery life, more internal memory (4GB versus 2GB). But the new upgrades has given some new features to nook that are not available in kindle. Nook should definitely remain under consideration when you're shopping for e-ink e-book readers. The decision may come down to a personal preference, such as how you feel about the color navigation screen versus the hard keyboard found on the Kindle.If my review did not answer any questions, leave a comment below and I will try my best to answer your question.",positive
"This tablet from barnes and noble is an afforadable alternative to the ipad. Serves more than one purpose ...while its primary function is reading. The original nook is a whole family experience. Its size and durability give the nook, nook color, and nook tablet are built with quality materials so that they have longevity. This is a gift for the teachers assistant at my sons school. She wanted something to read her books on, and since i have the nook color i figured this would be a good start for her.Barnes and Noble NOOK eBook Reader (WiFi only) [ Black & White]",positive
I bought this unit as a gift for the grandchildren to read books. My plan was test it out and buy 3 if it worked. I planned to buy gift cards for the unit so the kids could buy books. Barnes and Noble requires a credit card to activate this unit! That is a show stopper as it is not desirable for young children to have a unit with credit card information linked to it. They could lose the unit etc. I loaded my credit card information to test the unit. After deciding to return the unit I talked to customer service about deleting my account information. The answer from 3 people was you can not delete your account information. I can not recommend this company.,positive
"I bought the Nook last week, its always a joyous experience to buy something from a store, activation was easy on the device, took some time to create new account on Barnes and noble site, but I was ready to go in 15 minutes.I purchased one book and started reading immediately, after 4 days, suddenly the e-ink screen went darker. The device comes with one year warranty, I took it to the store and they replaced it in 5 minutes, again, the store experience was great.Pros:1- The device look and feel is good, design is sleek and smooth.2- Touch screen is a good idea, I have tendinitis so I prefer to use touch screen over keyboard.3- The page turn keys are in good place, very comfortable to read and hold at the same time.4- Found many books on the library search, it has detailed editorial and user reviews, with ratings, just like Amazon site.5- The format is not proprietary, this was a huge sale point for me, there are other devices that can read the same format.6- Battery is replaceable and memory SD slot is available.Cons:1- The touch screen is sluggish, you need to use it slower than using other touch devices, this is either buggy hardware or CPU is too slow.2- First device I got was defective, not a good sign, hopefully the second one is better.3- Browsing the web is ok, but using the small touch screen to navigate through HTML is not an easy task, especially since it is sluggish.4- Not all books are available in the on-line library, I found a psychology book in the store that did not exist for download.5- You need to use screw driver to open the back cover and replace battery or insert SD card.6- Little bit heavy, certainly heavier than a medium size hard cover book.",positive
"I purchased both the Kindle (Wi-Fi) and this Nook (the original) and tried them out during the return period. While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (better screen contrast, and many other features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch (Nook ST) ereader. It is just now starting to show up in B&N; stores (not on Amazon yet). I was lucky enough to find a store near me that had one that was not spoken for yet. I bought it yesterday and have been busy trying it out. It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook ST, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the ""slide to unlock"" feature like the iPhone.  The touchscreen on the Nook ST is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine.  I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.I returned the original Nook since the Nook ST is so much better. Note that the Nook ST doesn't have 3G connectivity, a web browser, or an MP3 player. If you want all that, buy the original Nook. If you don't require all of these features and would like a basic e-reader with an intuitive touch screen interface, then take a look at the Nook ST.The Nook ST is just beginning to become available (only at B&N; right now), but I suspect that Amazon and other high quality retailers will be selling it very soon.Here's another plus for the Nook (whether it is the original one or the ST).  The Kindle has a proprietary ebook format that limits your options in purchasing and reading ebooks.  Nook uses Adobe EPUB, which is an open format and there are multiple online sites that offer books in this format (including most public libraries).",positive
"I was the biggest nook/kindle hater on the planet before being gifted this nook. I would constantly diss the e-readers claiming that books were soooo much better. Then I ordered a book series from Amazon and the books/print was so tiny that I could barely read them without straining my eyes and driving myself crazy. My mom (&lt;3!!) gave me my brothers old nook since he had a new nook color so I could download and read the series on this. It wasn't cheap to download the books, but compared to reading the free versions a friend had sent me (which were horrible because the text was all messed up...typos galore) but the option to make the text larger or smaller and the clarity of the screen made the 8+ dollars per book soooo worth the price.The battery on this lasts so long it's insane. I would read daily maybe 5 hours per day over the summer (hey, I had to finish the series before school resumed!) and I only had to charge it once a week tops, even then the battery wasn't drained I just didn't want to give it a chance to run out. I am so in love with my nook now it's insane. I can download almost any book I could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little, lightweight nook.Another big plus....MY BOOKMARKS DON'T FALL OUT OF THE NOOK!! Nothing is more frustrating than losing your place and going bananas trying to find it without revealing something you haven't read yet.Also, when it comes to textbooks this is a lifesaver!! My back loves the nook. I cannot recommend the nook (or any e-reader in general) enough. You can still buy physical books (I do and will never stop because I absolutely love them) but for an avid reader the nook is such a great addition to your life.Even though my first nook was free (making it that much sweeter), I would gladly lay down $100+ for a replacement if anything happened to mine or for a newer model, not the color though, that's more like a tablet PC than an e-reader.",positive
"I asked for this e-reader for Christmas due to seeing it in a Barnes and Noble store and learning about its features. It  offers greater compatibility with different ebook formats than the Kindle (particularly the EPUB format), has access to special offers when you're inside a Barnes and Noble store, and permits you to lend books to other Nook users. There's also a little color LCD touch screen at the bottom for accessing menu options.Personally, I haven't taken advantage of most of the Nook's features yet, but I do like what I see so far. The touchscreen adds a great deal of versatility to the device and I'd say it's easier to access menu options this way than with just one e-ink screen and some buttons. I also appreciate the ability to upgrade the memory with a microSD card, but I would have preferred to do so without opening the device. Also, if you have a problem with the Nook, you shouldn't have a problem getting a replacement. I, er, damaged my first Nook through, shall we say, ""user error,"" but B&N; staff was happy to provide a new one for me.It's not quite perfect, though. It's kind of heavy, for one thing. The touchscreen is a bit slow to respond and can significantly drain the battery, for another. And, some of the Nook's buttons seem to be a little too stiff. I prefer soft, clicky buttons, you know? Maybe in its next iteration the Nook will have proper buttons instead of this ""bendy plastic"" business.Anyway, which e-reader you get largely boils down to your personal preferences, and which retailer's online library you'd rather have access to. For my part, I think the Nook satisfies all of my needs just fine. Be careful where you buy it from, though. $180, which is the price it's selling for on Amazon right now, is way too much when you can just walk into a brick and mortar store and get it for thirty bucks less.",positive
"When I purchased this item it was still running $150.  At the current price, I think it's a good deal but I'm not sure it would be my choice if I could roll back time.  I originally purchased this because I wanted to rent ebooks from the Library and that wasn't an option with the Kindle.  Now, they come for the Kindle as well as in epub and pdf formats.  You can basically use any ereader to rent these now.I read all these reviews saying that the black and white was like paper, easiest to read.  It's not anything like a paper book, it's far less ""bright"" when it comes to reading.  Don't get me wrong, I love ebooks.  I haven't read a paper book in a year.  It is just that even in regular light it is not as easy to see for me.  You absolutely can read it without a light during the day, but it is not nearly as crisp or easy as it would be with a paper book.  I have a clip on light, and with that it's perfect at night.  I'm able to read in bed and not disturb my husband, if one wants a black and white reader as close to paper as you can get--I'm just not sure this is what one would expect.This reader has a browser which you can use to get on the internet.  It was handy when we were in a hotel with wifi and I didn't bring the laptop and I needed to know when a business opened.  It's certainly not easy to surf, this would not be my choice to use unless in a pinch.The battery does not last as long as I expected.  I get maybe a week and a half out of it, if I turn it completely off when not using it--and if I have it on airplane mode (not wifi enabled).  I do read at least a few hours a day.  The time is much shorter if I let it just hibernate.I am not sure if the text size options are specific to the device or the book.  It appears to me it is the device that offers limited options, though it varies based on the originating text of the book. The text size on extra large--the largest option-- is often (it varies by book) small enough that it would equal that of a normal book.  My vision is pretty good and occasionally I'm annoyed by how small extra large is.  In some books medium is the same as extra large in others.  I do think that for anyone with vision challenges, limited text size might be an issue.Obtaining books is easy to do through Barnes and Noble.  You need to go online on a computer and provide a credit card.  You can then order them on the computer, or through your device.  I generally use the computer, but if you know what you want--ordering directly from the Nook is quick and easy.  Transferring library rentals is also as easy as drag and drop, using Adobe Digital Solutions (free app, the library should have a link to download it).All in all, it's a good ereader.  I've never had any mechanical issues with it.  It is sturdy and reliable.",positive
"I have been eyeballing e-readers for a while and I was absolutely certain that I was going to purchase a Kindle.  Well many moons ago I worked at Barnes and Noble and stopped in to visit and old friend.  He introduced me to the Nook, I shrugged up my nose and said, 'Yeah, I'm sold on the Kindle.'After playing around with the Nook, I really found myself enamored of it.  I like the touch screen.  I like that the battery replacement if necessary is something the consumer can do.  I liked that you could share your nook books with others.  On the Nook that I have -and I did purchase a refurbished Nook - games included are suduko and chess.  The daily is a feature that automatically downloads articles specifically for the Nook users.  The library is where you can store all of your books and create shelves for your titles and organize the titles.  Shopping is a breeze, either directly on the nook or online.  You will need a card, be it debit or credit to purchase the books, you can use gift cards, but I believe that you need to have a card on file.I can store and listen to music on my Nook, I can access the internet (mine is WiFi) and use it to search and answer email or update facebook.In short, I'm madly in love with it.  I have not had any problems with it.  The charge holds for a pretty long time, I haven't measured it in time myslef.It is simple to use, very friendly and there is an incredible book selection for the Nook.  i happen to be a big fan of classic literature and Russian literature and I have had no trouble filling up my library.  Storage capacity is quite large and i have an additional micro SD card just in case, but I am no where near filling up my storage yet.The books are also available on my personal computer, and if I decide to archive a book, but do not necessarily want to delete the title altogether, I can archive it and later retrieve that title from my online account.  Archiving titles would allow you to free up space on your Nook.Recommendations, I have a silicone slip cover to protect my Nook if I drop it, I also have a slightly hardcover case to protect the Nook when it is in my purse, I do have a book light as the screens are not backlit to avoid glare.The only downside, some fools will think your screen is paper and they will touch it in awe and smudge up your reading screen.",positive
"I selected the black and white NOOK over the Kindle because I can download books from public libraries to my laptop and copy them to the NOOK.  We travel full time in our RV, and I have library cards in three states.  I can always find books I want to read from the libraries.  I haven't bought a book since I bought the NOOK four months ago.The display is incredible.  I sit in the sun and read a lot, and the brighter the sunlight, the better the display.  Try that with a traditional LCD display.  Since the black and white NOOK has no backlight for the book pages, it requires as much ambient light as a traditional paper book.  In dim lighting I use a clip-on book light, as I did with paper books.While I can use the NOOK several hours a day for several days between charges, an hour or two a day of charging keeps it charged.  The NOOK Color has a much shorter battery life, as well as being heavier.The 3G option for the NOOK is a waste of money unless you want to buy books and magazines directly from Barnes & Noble, or if you want to try to use the NOOK as a tablet computer.  It really doesn't have the horsepower for that.",positive
Not happy with my Nook.  Be forewarned...you can pay for some books and they will download but you can't open them.  How to avoid this? Open up the description of your book on the buying site and make sure it says for Nook..and not nook color or nook etc...just Nook.  I've had to ask for credits several times already.There aren't enough books available in my opinion to justify using the darn thing. Maybe the Nook Color is a better bet?,positive
"First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!What a great gift, and a great buy!!!**************Update****************5/30/2011The Nook is still awesome... Since I have owned the Nook for a while now, I came back to offer an update..As far as downloading books, I downloaded books the other day and before I could blink they were on my Nook!I am still happy with my Nook and love my Nook! I have recommended the Nook to friends and family who have also made purchases and are happy with the Nook as well.The performance of my Nook is awesome, and I have had great experiences with my Nook since the day I was surprised with the Nook as a gift! Best gift anyone can give! The joy of reading!I take my Nook with me every where! My children are still in love with my Nook and love to play the games on my Nook or read a book. My husband even likes for the children to read books on the Nook. The Nook has brought so much fun and the joy of reading to our family!You can also go to Barnes and Nobles and take classes to learn more about your Nook as there is so much to learn and so much that the Nook has to offer. Check in your area to see what times your local Barnes and Nobles offers classes.I also like the Nook because the Nook continues to educate you on a daily basis with the daily blog of what took place on the days of the week, for example if you turn on your Nook right now and go to the daily, it will inform you what took place on this date. Which to me is a neat feature as you get to learn something new about something you may have  not known.As far as the touch screen part of the Nook, we love it! It does not distract us but adds to the beauty of the Nook in our opinion. It is easy for my family to use.********2012 Update*****Well it is 4/24/2012 and I still love my Nook and my Nook still works great! I just wanted to give another update for individuals looking for a e reader.As of this date, our children are now asking as they did before can they have my Nook. And for now they can use my Nook, but I still love Nook and I am not ready to give my Nook up. One day we will purchase Nooks for the whole family.As far as use, I was out in the sun and reading with no problem. So many e reads and tablets are currently on the market. This nook still works for me and still performs and amazes me. There is still so much to learn with the Nook I currently own. If you are looking for a great affordable e reader. Don't over look Nook.  Good luck with your decision.Hopefully this update will help you in your decision. We would by one hundred more and pass them out as gifts and charity, just so people can get to read and find joy in reading! Great tool to use to educate children and adults!Back to my Nook!",positive
"I've owned this original Nook for two years now and have read dozens of books on it.  I've also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with Nook support and other activities related to keeping it running.  I'm an experienced software designed/programmer, engineer, etc. and I can assure you that compared to a paper book, this is a seriously flawed concept.  If you insist on buying an eBook reader, make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps.  B&N;'s concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gear.On top of those problems, consider the very concept of the electronic book.  While you will pay close to the same price you'd pay for a real book on sale, you won't own the book - you'll have a license to use it.  When you're finished with the book, maybe you'd like to be able to loan it to a relative or friend, but you can only do that if they have a Nook and you can loan it for two weeks only.  I suppose when the two weeks is up, the borrower sees the book disappear, finished or not.And then there's the odd problem of your Nook for some reason being tied closely to the email address you had on file with B&N; when you registered your Nook.  I recently had to change my email address and updated my B&N; account with the new address and new B&N; password.  After that, I could no longer download books, and was unable to unregister and register my Nook (that was supposed to fix the problem, according to the support center).  If you happen to get yourself into that dilemma, be ready for a long drawn-out session on the telephone.  The problem was that B&N; neglected to spell this situation out on their website when I changed my email address.So, if you're into ""going green"", driving a hybrid car (and thinking it's going to save you money in the long run), then the Nook may be for you.  If all you want to do is read, forget the Nook and go to the local library or bookstore and spend your time reading.  Give the price of the Nook to a local charity.  Everyone will be happier.",positive
This is the nook i dont like..it doesnot habe light to let you read at night but have a colored screen to navigate..this is poorly conceptualized as ereader..not user friendly too..,positive
"I've had my Nook for about 2 weeks and love it. Before I purchased it, I spent weeks researching the differences between the Barnes and Noble Nook and the Kindle and other ereaders. I chose the Nook because I can read .epub format books on it; something you cannot do on the Kindle. The Kindle only supports .pdf files and ebooks in the proprietary Amazon.com format. That severely limits the number and type of ebooks you can read.With the Nook, I have borrowed free ebooks from my local library and within minutes downloaded them to my computer and then transferred them to my Nook. AWESOME! In addition, unlike the Kindle, I can read free ebooks available from Google.The only thing I don't like about the Nook and the Kindle is that neither one of them has a back-lit screen so, at night or in the dark, you have to have alternative ample light. So I either turn on a lamp or use the small, clip-on light I bought at the local RiteAid for about $10. It works just fine.So far, I have had no problems navigating my ebooks; everything works smoothly and the pages turn quickly. I'm enjoying the convenience of being able to travel with 30 books and audio-books at a time. I also have some music loaded on my Nook so I can listed to it while I read. Lastly, I'm glad I bought a case for it because I pretty much take it every place I go so the hard case prevents the screen from getting scratched or broken.I'm very happy with my purchase.",positive
"I loved using this nook reader. The bottom touch screen made navigation very convenient, and the reading screen was also very nice.We are now switching to the all-new touch-screen nook that just came out. Yay! :)",positive
"I have seen the Kindle and wish I would have gotten it.  The kindle was out of stock and I got the Nook.  The battery life is not good at all I can only get 100 pages at a time if I'm lucky and on airplane mode.  The Kindle apparently will get you 10 times that!  If I had to do it again the Kindle would be the way to go, but Amazon lost a sale and was out of stock...",positive
"Bought this for my wife a couple months ago and it's great!  I bought it over a Kindle because of issues I researched about Amazons' proprietary ebook formats and to get library books or other epubs you had to do some conversion to get them to work on the Kindle.  I wanted the easiest thing for my wife to deal with and the Nook is great - had a couple ebooks (from Borders.com and Barnes and Noble) downloaded and library books the first night!  Just need a free download to manage the books from Adobe and your set.  Its easy to navigate, batteries last about a month and my wife uses it every day.  Buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",positive
"I bought this on the 27th of December after hassling with FedEx (to the point where I made them just hold it at a FedEx office) 2 days later I finally have it after (It was attempted for delivery on Friday 1/6) I was pleasently surprised to discover how small this thing is. I've watched a ton of reviews and unboxing a on it and I guess the camera angles made it look wider. It's so tiny it can fit in a larger pocket (Like pajama pockets). I already have 12 books and I actually finished one just now I started reading it at 1:30pm and it's 11:45pm I say not bad the book was 155 pages too. Once I got the hang of it I was very pleased with my purchase and I recommend probably just getting the Nook Simple Touch but coming down to reading it doesn't matter just read people! That's a little rant. So I'll maybe give another in depth review of this in a week. See you soon, thanks for reading my review.",positive
"When I first heard about e-book readers, I was skeptical and did not want to give up my precious collection of books. (I have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me!) But then I finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night, and due to being away from home for periods of time where I couldn't easily carry a dozen books with me.The first reader I had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin' Kindle DS readers with the full key pad. I was excited about that one, but the price was WAY out of range. I decided to try and go with the Nook (after my typical pre-purchase ritual of spending days doing research on the best option) and I was so thrilled with it, I had nothing bad to say. I used that little beauty for a few good years, until I was forced to sell it to help pay bills. From the very moment the Nook left my hands I regretted it. I was certain I'd never find one that good again. And I don't believe there has been any readers since then that are that good still!Fast-forward to this Black Friday. The FIRST Black Friday when I actually HAVE some money to spend! And I am looking for a really good e-reader! I did come across the Nook on Amazon, and saw the new Nook Simple Touch, which intrigued me, because I wanted to stick with the e-ink display, and not have a full-size touch screen battery killer. Finally, I realized my love for the original Nook had never died, and it still had everything I could ever want in an e-book reader. I was even able to buy one from a vendor here on Amazon, who lived less than half an hour away from me, and it only cost me $50!!! I was SOOOOO excited!!Now, if only I had NOT wasted $5 on that stupid fake-leather black cover, that completely RUINED the casing on my Nook... :(",positive
"High Points:-Easy to read screen-Touchscreen responsive-Love the physical page turning keys on either side (wish the NookColor had this feature)-Size (can hold it easily in one hand)-Lots of Free Classic Books and Classic Books available for 99 cents-Easily transfer books from your library from device to device (any Nook device or device with a Nook App)-Very organized library (and easy to pick up where you left off no matter how long the Nook has been turned off)-Beautiful design & feels very sturdy and well made-Great accessories-Battery Life (charge lasts about 10 days if you have it on with the internet off for a few hours everyday-MUCH better than the NookColor which gets about 3 days with comparable usage)-eLend compatible with your local library if they offer that feature (which is the only reason I chose this over the Kindle)-Free Updates (as the software improves, you won't have to buy a new device to get the upgrades, like faster page turning, better internet experience, etc)-Free eBook Fridays via the Barnes & Noble storeLower Points:-Delay between turning the page (not a deal breaker by any means but there is a flash everytime you turn the page, which I personally don't like)-Weight (you get used to it, but it could be lighter)-Browsing the internet and playing games via the tiny touchscreen is cumbersome. Not to mention the internet function is quite basic and everything is of course in einkConclusion:If you don't have to have a color screen or a touchscreen and just want an eReader, I think this is a great choice. I love some of the features on this and think they should have been on the NookColor. I definitely read a lot more books now and it's easy to take with me everywhere I go.",positive
"I bought this device not expecting much out of it.  Reading books is a breeze...the screen is clear even in bright light.  The device is VERY light...feels like holding a small clipboard. I find myself touching the reading part of the screen....just a bad habit as I am used to using my iphone.  As with any device, you might want to breeze thru the manual first because I sure didn't...took me a while to figure out that the ""n"" on the front is the ""home"" key.The craftsmanship feels pretty low end.  I think if for some reason it fell out my hand, it would definitely break.  i have never dropped it...that's just my opinion.  Battery life is good...tho using the wifi decreases the battery life a lot faster.  Though this can browse the net, don't even think about having a good experience doing that...the browser sucks.  Keep in mind, this is not a computer, nor a pocket PC/tablet PC...so if you're looking for something to browse the net, you should buy something else.On a whole, I find the device to be a little slow, but great for what it is intended for. it probably ""turns"" the pages as fast as you would turn the page of a real book.  I'm already used to fast devices, so that is probably why this seems slow to me.**International Buyers**This device will download books if you're outside the US, however, you need to have a credit card that was issued from the US to purchase the books.  I even tried purchasing an eGift card from Barnes and Nobles and using that to purchase my books, and even though i was successful in purchasing the gift card, it will check your default credit card prior to deducting credit from your gift card.  I ended up having to change the name on the account to my mom's name and used her credit card to purchase books. (she lives in the US)",positive
"Amazon is missing big by not supporting library eBooks on its Kindle ! I would've bought Kindle, since I prefer a physical keyboard, better battery life and lighter weight of the Kindle (plus a marginally better processing speed and eink technology), but since my two library systems I belong to contain thousands upon thousands of digital books that I can borrow for 21 days at a time, buying the Nook was a no-brainier !I am cheapskate, so I very rarely buy a book - instead I borrow them from the library. Occasionally though I need to buy a book that is not available in the library at all, or in a digital format, or I need it for more than 21 days (as when I travel overseas), so I end up just buying two digital books from Barnes and Noble for my Nook. Had Amazon not been so afraid of loosing sales by supporting library digital books (a groundless fear IMO), I would've bought those two books from Amazon for my Kindle, instead of from their underdog competitor Barnes and Noble !",positive
"I received the Nook as a Christmas present.  I already own a Kindle latest generations, 3g/wifi.  However I soon discovered that not all books are available on the Kindle and 99.9% of the books I couldn't get on my Kindle are on Nook.  After much research I soon learned that if you want good ebook reader you buy either a Kindle or a Nook.  So I asked Santa for it.I will not tell you I like the Nook better than my Kindle or my Kindle better than my Nook.  Both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereaders.Here's a few on the Nook:  1- It keeps the book title, time, and battery charge visible while reading.  2-It starts up just a bit faster than the Kindle.  3-You can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper.  4-it recognizes the table of contents in PDF books.  5-it reads EPUB file types (meaning you can buy books from Borders.com too and read them)As for the Kindle here are a few features I love about it:  1-I like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen.  2-It reads PDFS much better than the Nook, more so when you have the PDF converted.  3-the page turns are a bit faster.  4-I prefer the black housing to white.  5-the reading page/screen has no glare at all (the Nook's little color panel on the bottom is very reflective) and it seems the print is a little darker.Both the Nook and Kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on.  I think the thing I was most disappointed in with the Nook are the covers.  They are not enough covers that actually close, like the Kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag, you don't want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface.If you are looking for a great ereader, you cannot go wrong with this Nook or the Kindle latest generation, in my book they are both on the top shelf.  Now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unit.Update:  After using both my Nook and Kindle for a while now I've decided I do like the Kindle much better than the Nook.  The page turning buttons on the Kindle are very very light touch, the reading screen does have darker print, and the collections feature is top notch.  Now my Nook, the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages, the reading screen is lighter, and the shelves option is ok.  What I don't care for in the shelves feature is I can't colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when I want to search in them.  I also don't care for the B&N; Library being seperate from My Documents.  On the Kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections.  With the Nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them.  I've also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom.  I don't have large fingers and don't wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy.  However, when I'm tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen I just can't seem to get what I want.  But when I don't mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it, I trigger a menu move.  It's still a very good reader, but when comparing options and usability, I'd choose the Kindle any day over the Nook.  I'll purchase most of my books on the Kindle and what isn't Kindlized will go on the Nook.",positive
"Very good product overall.  Manipulation is somewhat clumbersome, but after use for a few hours, it is ok.  I understand that the new version (color) fixes these issues.  The display really does give the feel of paper.  Only negative is no backlighting for use in very low to no light conditions.Overall love the product.",positive
"I have been an Amazon fan for a long time. My first attempt at owning a Kindle resulted in two failing devices for which I eventually obtained a refund.My birthday is today; my brother asked me what I wanted two weeks ago and I told him the Kindle. Unfortunately at that precise moment Amazon was right in the middle of rolling out the new Wi-Fi only Kindle and all models were unavailable.  So, I went for the barnes & noble nook Wi-Fi only.Considering my previous experience with the Kindle, I tried not to get too excited. I went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful. I read that it was buggy, that it lagged when you changed pages, that the touch interface was not all that responsive.All of this was wrong; the page turns are quick and do not interrupt the flow of reading.  The touch interface is very nice and I like seeing my book covers in color. When you choose the Cover Flow, your books slide by with the touch of a finger and you simply tap on the book you want to read at that moment.  This was surprisingly helpful when I went to make purchases on the B&N; Store. I know you don't judge a book by its cover, but how many times has a nice colorful packaging led me to a book I wanted to read, uhm; many times. I was really intrigued with the ""swipe"" page turn that you used the touch screen for, however this did not seem to function correctly on the store model or on my own nook. Strangely, after a period of time, it now works perfectly. A representative told me it simply had to adapt to my touch...I don't know how much I trust that statement, however when she turned a page on the display nook it responded to her very well. (Perhaps it was a learning curve?)Side-loading documents: Wow, if you have any epub or pdf documents all you have to do is side load them and voila.  I do recommend a free program called Calibre, which organizes your books, helps you edit the tags, add a color cover, or convert to epub. Pdf is not very easy to read on the nook, but if you convert to epub it goes smoothly, unless there are alot of photos or images, which lessens the accuracy of the conversion. Calibre has even converted files like, Word-Doc, Html, Palm, etc. Calibre will let you pick and choose books to upload to the nook directly from the program; in other words it 'sees' the nook.Drawbacks to the nook: The battery life, that nifty little color touch screen eats the battery power like mad.  B&N; claim that you get 10 days, cut that in half. I do not know if this is because I use the touch screen to do my page turns or not,(the other option being the side buttons) but I am leaning toward, maybe? LCD screens notoriously use power; but using the page turn function does not require the back-light to be on, so I am not sure how it is eating up the battery so badly. It is honestly not that much of a problem for me. I am around my computer so much that it is unlikely a day will go by without it being attached to the CPU or an outlet next to my bed. I have gone almost four days with not re-charging; and I could see that little power icon decrease at least to slightly more than half in that time.Oh - and that nifty little cover flow on the color screen.  Don't expect it to work for Your Documents.  (There are two libraries, the B&N; purchased books and your side-loaded books or documents.) Also there is no way to sort your documents to your specification so you either sort by author, title, or the date you loaded them, very annoying if you build up a nice library; which is highly likely considering you can add an SD card to your nook and increase memory to 16 maybe 32 gigabytes. Speaking of which with that ability to increase memory, it would have been nice if the MP3 Player interface were a little more sophisticated.  An interesting ability is to play an unabridged audio-book and read the book at the same time. I am not sure who would do that, but then again I understand spoken Spanish more than I am capable of reading it.  This might be useful to me in that area, if I can find the matching audio-book/ Spanish-book. (Nuance in foreign language is often lost in English translation.)Never having owned a functioning 3G eBook-reader, I never really missed it with my home Wi-Fi. I have discovered several places close to where I ""haunt"" which have AT&T; free to my nook. I already have a huge collection of books lined up for me to read... so feeling a ""need"" for the 3G seems unlikely. I have always done this, collected books that line up, ready for me to read. (By the way... the in store B&N; Wi-Fi connection has s*cked at every B&N; store I have been to. Amazingly Border's free Wi-fi worked better, I just couldn't buy through the B&N; store. I had to go to my smart phone, buy the book, and it uploaded.)So how do I feel about my nook; I absolutely love it! To be fair however, had I received a functioning Kindle, I would have felt the same way about it, I am certain. I think the Kindle has deficiencies with the lack of a touch/color interface and the side loading documents ability. However, that screen kills the battery as I stated.  The reason for liking the separate touch interface is that you don't want to touch your e-ink screen; I don't see how Sony's all touch interface e-reader is going to be popular when you are smudging your read screen all the time, though I must admit I would like to try one out.The nook is comfortable in all sorts of positions, laying in bed, on the couch, holding it next to you; even laying it away from you and increasing the font so that you could read without holding it. I highly recommend a reading light, especially if you had grown accustomed to reading LCD screens in the dark (my kindle program on my Android phone.)It is rather frustrating, I would have preferred a Kindle simply because I was impressed with Amazon customer service when my Kindle malfunctioned.I do recommend the nook. It would be nice if they would lessen DRM restrictions so I could buy books from Amazon or any other place for that matter.SincerlyR",positive
"First off, I want to start out by saying that I love my Nook. My friend is an employee of B&N; so he was there to help guide me along in my selection and answer any questions I had. So, yes, I did have a little bias to the product to begin with. However, for what I need, this is perfect in almost every single way. In my review I'll compare the Nook to the Kindle ($139 version) and it's major differences, just so people know what I'm talking about in terms of other products as we go down the list.The Bad (If you want to call it that):1. The Nook is a little heavier than the Kindle. I'm not sure of the exact weight differences, but just by feel alone it is a tad bit heavier. Now, that can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. I for one don't find it to be a deal buster, the weight is not catastrophically heavier and uncomfortable, but it is heavier than the Kindle. I do think, however, that the durability of the Nook is a little better compared to the Kindle. The Nook has built in paddles to turn the pages, while the Kindle has flappy paddles along the side that feel as though they could break if I dropped it on it's side or if I touched it to hard. My suggestion for anyone interested in buying the Nook is to also buy a carrying case for it so it makes it easier to read, almost as if you were reading a real book. The covers at B&N; usually start around $30.2. The Nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it. Some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark. For me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text. However, whenever I read a book I find many distractions around me while I read. It's not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you won't see your reflection. Again, not a deal buster in anyway I wouldn't think.3. The start up time is atrocious. I can't defend this one in anyway. Amish people can put up houses in a faster amount of time before the Nook would have a chance to get to your homepage. Ok, so not quite that slow, but you get the idea. I haven't timed it yet but I'm going to take an educated guess that it takes around 1-1/2 minutes to start up. That is something that should have been addressed from B&N; to begin with. Again, I can't defend this one in anyway.Ok, so what you have all been waiting for: The Good1. The extra storage feature is superb. The Nook comes with a built in 2GB storage space. Enough for most people, 2GB will get most every book you want to read in your Nook with no problem. However, if you are a fanatic reader that has Newspapers and Magazines delivered to your Nook everyday or every week, this can begin to take up space if you don't free it up. But don't fret! The Nook comes with an extra storage slot for your SD card that can hold up to whatever the highest SD card space is out there. The great thing about it is, SD cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found 3 years ago, so adding space is cheap.2. The Nook has a featured called ""LendMe"". This is something that the Kindle does not have and I'm sure for competition sake will have in the future. This a great, great, great feature to the Nook! If you have any friends, family or co-workers that have a Nook and have a book on theirs that you would like to read, you can hook up wireless or through the computer and Lend them a copy of it for up to 14 days. If you're a fast reader then you can knock out a 500-600 page book in easily 14 days.3. Your county library might be on the list of Nook rentals. In the county in which I reside in North Carolina, our county library is fortunate enough to have a system in which I can rent books for 14 days from the library. This also is something the Kindle does not have. Before I go off on how great the feature for renting books is, I should point out that the library is going to have a limited selection of books for you to rent. I'm a big Thomas Sowell reader and he has approximately 30 books out on the market. However, the county library that I rent from has only 1 book from his selection. So do you're research before you buy a book, your county library might have it already. The feature, as I have seen, is relatively easy to use. You do have to hard wire your Nook to your computer after you download some software, but it's really simple and the kind people at your local county library can assist you on how to do this. In fact our county library had everything we needed in terms of software and directions on their website.4. Finally. You can take your Nook to B&N; and read any book for up to an hour. Recently I went to grab some coffee at B&N; and wanted to read a book on Ireland. Popped open my Nook, connected to the B&N; network (already programmed into your nook for ease), selected the book I wanted to read from the list I searched on, and wam-bam I was reading a book. You can read lots of books on one Nook from their online selection without having to lug 20 actual books that you wanted to compare before you bought.In closing on this review I would say first and foremost do your homework. Go to B&N; or BestBuy and try out the Kindle, Nook and even the Sony Reader. Some will really like the touch screen of the Nook compared to the touchpad of the Kindle, but it's all in what you like. Some will like the fact you can Lend books and some won't.I'm sure I've missed out on something that others would like to know about the product before buying, so if you have any questions please contact me back here on Amazon and I'll try to get to you as quickly as possible.",positive
in my honest opinion nook is unfinished product.none of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with middle-size font.i am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadable.formula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable. i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on fine-tuning the text rendering on ebook reader.,positive
"With these new ereaders on the market, the act of reading has come back to be a very ""in-style,"" technologically advanced and hip thing to do in 2010. Books are now less intimidating and more fun and convenient, and this becomes only more encouraged through Barnes and Noble's Nook.Now, to cut to the chase, the Nook can do most things that the Amazon Kindle can do as well, and while the Kindle holds some ground over the Nook, on an overall scale, if you're looking for a better and more convenient ereader, I'd say to go for the Nook.Both the Kindle and Nook have clear displays, but overall, I would say that the Kindle's display seems to have better resolution. The Kindle also beats the Nook on battery life (as you'll notice that the Nooks battery life seems to last about a week, whereas the Kindle about a month, this is due to the draining power of the Nook's light-up touch screen menu). People may also prefer the button keyboard operation of the Kindle over the Nooks sometimes annoyingly sensitive or not-sensitive-enough touch screen. The Kindle is also thinner and lighter than the Nook. Both have mp3 features though, which helps them. It's always great to be able to read to your favorite music.Now, while it may seem in this paragraph the Kindle has the Nook easily beaten, one must look deeper into finding out why the Nook is a better choice. The reason the nook beats the Kindle is easy - in its navigation, presentation and overall ease of use.The biggest problem with the Kindle (that I noticed) is that the Kindle seems to want to have the look and feel of navigating like a laptop computer in the way it presents the main menu and font size, style and book selection. The problem with this is one thing - this is NOT a computer, it's a portable book, and Barnes and Noble knows this, and made their unit feel way less like just another annoying technological gadget but instead with a ""browsing bookstore"" type of presentation. This is a very BIG difference between the two, and you can sense it even after just a few minutes of toying with it. And this is only talking about the OLDER Nook, I can only imagine how much more amazing of a presentation the color Nook can get with all of its full color pictures and extras.On top of this, the Kindle seems to have placed the turn-page buttons way too attached to the ends, so you actually end up hitting the buttons by accident way too often, whereas the Nooks buttons are more of a soft ""bendable plastic"" type, so you never hit them by accident. This, on top of the little things like being able to slide your finger on the touch screen to turn pages as well as getting book covers and previews, daily logs, etc, give the nook an overall more ""coffee house"" feel which the Kindle doesn't even come close to. And even though the Nook is bulkier and heavier, it actually is made of a more durable softer rubber-like material, and along with the white paneling it makes it feel overall way more professional and studious. Not to mention just more attractive and stylish. This is easily the hipper of the two ereaders. Therefore, things like slightly longer load times, heavier feel, sometimes annoying touch screen and slightly higher price are actually very tolerable once you pick up both units and see and feel the overall difference.Books are an old-fashioned type of entertainment, and while the Kindle tries to make reading and literature just another tacked on 21st century technological piece of unrelatable modernized hardware, the Nook walks the perfect line of bringing the ""old-fashioned"" hobby of reading to a hipper style for the 21st century without taking away the studious professionalism of reading or disrespect the art of literature either. The transition is so much smoother on the Nook that you'll forget you're even reading off of an electronic device.",positive
"This is a pretty nice looking toy but useless for any real application. No matter how hard I try I just can't force myself to try and read a book on the little 3"" by 5"" screen. The display is small, dim and has poor contrast so it's hard to read unless it's in bright sunlight and pictures on a page are too small to see clearly. It won't play very many types of books besides pdf files and Kindle books are not compatible. Also it goes to sleep if you don't keep constantly moving your finger around on it. Also it's supposed to be able to browse the web but the Web function doesn't do anything but show a Picture of a web page that talks about it's features but if that did work it would be useless since there's no mouse and no way to move around on the page. It can play MP3's that sound ok but it's 100's of times bigger than an iPod and too large to carry around.",positive
"I went from the Sony Reader Pocket Edition (which I really did like) to the Nook after the Wifi only version came out and I do not regret the move.  I love everything about the Nook and BN reader store. The Nook is bigger than the Sony Pocket Reader and after reading the Nook for awhile - I just could not go back to reading something on the Pocket Reader. I like the fact that you can enlarge the print up to extra extra large and choose between several font styles.  I like the clock at the top of the reader so now I don't have to waste my morning reading time on the porch by constantly running in to check the clock in the kitchen to see when I need to get ready for work.  I like the fact that you can look at the covers of the books when you want to pick out what you want to read next.  I like that you can add so much extra space to your device (the Pocket reader only accepted 150 books before freezing and acting up). I really like the fact that you can preorder ebooks which will just download to your device when they are available.  I like the fact that the power cord is $14.99 so I can buy extra (one for home, one for work) - where Sony Reader's power cord was almost $30.00.  I like the fact that I can install my own new battery when the time comes and not have to send my reader off to have it done for me.  I like the fact that if there are any questions about the Nook, I just have to go to a nearby B&N and get the help I need instead of wasting time with emails only to receive vague answers from the techs.  All in all I think this is a wonderful device - exactly what I wanted.  I usually read about three to four books a week and being able to carry my whole library with me is great!  I would definitely recommend this product.",positive
"Sorry Kindle, but the Nook is my book. I studied the various ereaders and tablets trying to decide what to spend my money on. Loved the idea of an iPad, but $600 is ridiculous for books, and it's size prohibits simple everyday usage. Android tablets seem too fickle and the technology is changing daily, without being upgradeable.So that leaves dedicated ereaders. Kindle was out for two main reasons: proprietary file format prohibits library rentals, and removable battery. The nook just seemed the right set of features.",positive
"My wife received a basic Nook for Christmas.  Being electronically challenged, she immediately plopped it in my lap with instructions to ""Buy me a book"". As the nearest B&N; store is 30 miles away I elected to follow the B&N; site to my PC, to the Nook route.  Opening an account on the B&N; site, purchasing a book and downloading it to my PC was easy and fast. Prices are about half that of a printed version. Passing it along to the Nook was another matter.  The Nook came with virtually no usable instructions, either printed or electronic, to explain the procedure that I wanted to use.  After going back to the B&N; site I discovered a little free program called ""Nook for PC"". After downloading that program I was able to copy the book from my PC to the Nook. Everything works fine now, and my wife is addicted to the thing, she takes it everywhere. She still will not, however, try to load new purchases on the Nook.We now have three copies of every book we have purchased, one on the B&N; site, one on my computer, and one on the Nook. With one Nook, it is pretty hard to share after she finishes, and although I can read the books on my PC, that just is not comfortable or practical.  I personally think $150 or so for my own Nook might be a little too much so I am going to look into a cheaper alternative. Walmart has one or two for under $120, one for under $90 that some people like.The Nook is a good option if all you want is a book reader.  The other functions do not seem to work well enough to be practical. The Nook might be a little expensive for what you get, but the service at the B&N; store we visited twice was excellent.  One evening after dinner we visited a B&N; store with Nook in tow. After my wife found a book she wanted, we took the book and the Nook to the Nook counter.  The attendant was happy to purchase the book with her Nook and download it for her.  The book cost for $24 and change, downloaded to the Nook, $12 and change. He even offered to return the book to the proper place on the shelf.  Not saying they will do this all the time, but it was a nice experience, and we saved a little money.",positive
"the battery is great-about 12-14 hours from 80% charged.  I was wondering how i would like an e-reader vers a book, and i must say that i don't even notice the difference.  love everything about it.  The only thing that could be better is the on/off function and wi-fi.  the power button is very sensistive and is tricky to turn on (at first).  the ewifi range is short.  maybe 30 ft from my router is all i can go.  other than that.  it works great, and at a very fair price",positive
"An eReader without e-ink? Really?eReaders are devices dedicated to reading, and thus the main inconvenience they should avoid is eye-strain.By introducing a backlit eBook, B&N; removed the key point of eReaders.If you need a device that has a backlit screen (and can afford a $283 device), why wouldn't you pay the extra $200 to get an iPad, which does the job much more efficiently?Please, correct me if I'm wrong, because I really don't get the point of this device.Thanks.",positive
"I knew about the NOOK Color even before it was released and I was really excited about this ereader, because I own a Kindle 3 and I'm part of the customers that think that it could offer more things and be more en par with the future. The NOOK Color has many features that appealed to me like touchscreen, vivid view technology, brightness adjustments, really nice web browser and mp3 player, etc. So I decided to order one with BlueProton cause they ship it to Canada, and I paid 60 dollars more than the actual price at B&N; and expedited shipping taxes on top of that. I didn't care, I just wanted my NC cause honestly I'm just tired of buying AAA batteries for my Clip light to read my Kindle 3 in bed. I noticed I never read in bright sunlight, I'm an indoors type of reader and I also like to browse while I read, mostly wikipedia and google and the Kindle we browser is primitive.Anyways, I got the NC promptly, I was super excited, but then I tried to transfer my epub books to it and noticed that my computer didn't recognize the unit's drive. Nothing popped. I had my iphone and my kindle plugged in and they were right there. I went to a friend's house and nothing popped on his computer either. A third try at a different laptop and same thing: nada. I went back home and kept trying and all of a sudden I started seeing smoke coming out of the USB port and a smell of burned toast. Really strong. I knew that unit was gone and that freaked me out. Everything else worked perfectly, but the USB was pooched. I returned it and they were very professional about it, but said that they found nothing wrong with the device. I bet they just reset it and tested ome of the features without actually testing its hardware. Anyways, I said I didn't want that unit back. Now here I am, with no Nook Color, nobody else sends it to Canada. I'm contacting friends in the US so I can send it to them, buying it straight from B&N; and then they can mail it to me. It's just weird that at this day and age we still can't have items shipped internationally, even when we're willing to pay more money for that luxury.Now I'm again using my Kindle like crazy, since it's all I got and it never fails. But I'm still gonna buy the NC no matter what. I just don't know if I'll sell my Kindle 3 in the future or keep it because it has sentimental value now, hehe.I think that for 249 US dollars, the NC is the best e-reader in the market. Right now the Kindle still leads and the iPad is coming strong, but 2011 will be the year the Nook Color will establish itself as a great competitor for these other two. If Amazon doesn't come up with a color Kindle with touchscreen, I strongly believe they will be the Betamax and VHS of the 2000s. But I really like the Kindle and if they came up with something like a reader's tablet, I would use it instead of using B&N;'s. However, that still hasn't happened and Jeff Bezos says he doesn't want that to happen just now. So I'll purchase a Nook Color and be happy with it.",positive
"My daughter wanted one of these for a while and after ""all her friends"" got them for Christmas we bought her one.  She uses it all the time and reads so much more now then before.  I hate having to pay for books she could just get from the library but our library now offers free books for the Nook that you can check out digitally for 2 weeks with no fees.  Now we get all sorts of books for it for free.  So happy with our purchase.",positive
"I bought the color Nook for a family member for Christmas. If I didn't already have the iPad and prefer Apple products, I would have purchased one of these for myself. I think it makes a much more user friendly product than Android tablets, and the price is good. Combine a good product at a great price with an already large library available from Barnes & Noble, and you have a real competitor to the iPad and Kindle.",positive
"I have been working on my fiction writing skills, and wanted an eBook reader so that I could read a variety of other novels to learn from them.  The Kindle is a great device, but I really wanted a color screen.  The iPad would have been a nice option, but was a bit expensive for my taste and a bit too large.  The myriad Android tablets on the market don't seem to get great reviews, though I suspect that will start to change once Android 3.0 is available.The Nook Color was a nice alternative.  Priced a little higher than some of the no-name Asian tablets, but far less than the iPad.  It supports multi-touch, has a decent color display, and the ability to insert micro SD cards into a slot near the ""loop"" on the bottom.Because it supports both ePub and PDF out of the box, you can find a nice selection of books to download (legally) on the web and read on the device without additional investment.  The Barnes and Noble site also offers a limited, but growing, selection of electronic books (both free and for-a-price).  If you get tired of reading, you can use the built-in WiFi and browser to surf the web.  You can also play a couple of the built-in games, with the promise of more coming in a future update from Barnes and Noble.My only complaints so far about the device are that the far edges of the touchscreen seem a little unresponsive, the micro-USB connector is a non-standard type that seems to require use of the proprietary cable.  The connector on the device itself seems to make poor contact with that cable, which makes it difficult or impossible to read on the device while it's charging.Apart from that, battery life has been really good.  I rarely have to plug it in before I am finished reading for the day.The built-in web browser works well, displaying pretty much any web site that an iPad or Android phone can handle.The WiFi seems to find and hold on to signals well, and I don't recall it dropping a connection so far.If you take the time to learn how to ""root"" the device, you can add the Android Market to it and many apps (like the Kindle app) work very nicely on it.  This gives you the best of both worlds in a sense... The ability to buy eBooks from Amazon and Barnes and Noble, while keeping your color display.As far as eye strain goes, I work at computers 8 or more hours a day on the job and more when I get home.  I find the Nook's display easy to read for hours at a time and don't feel that my eyes are any more strained than when I read a printed paper book.  But your mileage may vary.  If e-Ink works better for you, the Kindle is a great alternative.I like the ability to highlight parts of the books I'm reading, take notes inside the book as I read (e.g., to highlight particularly good dialogue, characterization, description, etc., as a writer), and to post updates to Twitter and Facebook about your progress through a book.All in all, this was my favorite 2010 Christmas gift and has (for me) eliminated any desire to own an iPad or any other eBook reader.",positive
"I have had my new Nook Color for about 24 hours so here are my early impressions:Pro:  good quality, good color, responsive to light touch, connects easily to WiFi, good eMail service, easy access to Barnes & Noble eBooks.  Very B & N friendly.  Very good battery charge life.Con:  Lousy quick setup guide (more like an advertisement), Only responds to finger touch (I prefer a screen that accepts stylus touch.  I have large hands and fingers).  Lousy speakers (but I expected that)  I Haven't been able to download movies from Netflix, I'll keep working on that.  Connection to Netflix was the main reason for buying the Nook Color.  Difficult to download other products.  No night time screen.  On line manual (>100 pages) is almost useless.This is my second tablet in the last month.  The first was a PanDigital Novel which I returned because it was an Android 2.0 and had limited capabilities and no access to Netflix.  AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE (NONE).  There is a B & N store 10 minutes from whre I live.  In the past I have spoken to the folks there and they seem very knowledgeable.  I will visit them again with my list of questions.  I'll do an update to this in a couple of weeks.Update.  Raised my rating to a 5 *.  I found out I needed to do a software update (from 1.3 to 1.4.1) in order to get NETFLIX.  The nice man at the B & N store did this for me in about 6 minutes.  I now get NETFLIX with very good reception.  At this time I really don't care about additional apps.  Everything I think I will ever want is in the NOOK Color now.  E-Mail in and out.  Downloads books from the Public Library in seconds.  Internet browsing ok.  eBay access is ok.  Bought a game for $0.99 just to check out my B & N account.  Easy.  NETFLIX was easy to set up.  Battery charge lasts longer than anticpated.  The software upgrade has made the device overall more user friendly.  The only complaint I still have is that I can't use a stylus.  Maybe I can exchange my fingers for a smaller set.  NOT SORRY I BOUGHT THIS GADGET.  Also, good quality and GREAT customer support.",positive
"I didn't buy this to be an e reader but as a small tablet PC, and I was rather surprised with how well it works. I'm using it much more than I thought I would. Most of the time I use an aftermarket Android OS (CyanogenMod) booting off a micro SD, there's no need to root or jail break the stock firmware to do this. With the aftermarket firmware, it also has Bluetooth, the micro USB can be used as a host USB with an adapter or USB gender changer, and it will charge the battery while plugged in to a PC's USB, normally it will only charge with the wall charger.My biggest complaint with the stock firmware is B&N;'s app store, the apps are fairly pricey, apps that are free elsewhere you have to pay for, there are a few free apps from B&N; but not many. With the aftermarket firmware I'm using the Amazon app market, much better selection and prices.Cons: The sound is about what I expected, fairly poor, but is greatly improved by using an amplified external speaker. The micro SD slot is in a very poor location making it very difficult to insert and remove, it's located under a hinged cover behind the loop in the lower left corner, it's well protected there, just not easy to access. Don't expect to watch streamed HD video, however, sites like YouTube work fine.Despite the cons, I give 5 stars, I think it's a great value, I have been very pleased with it.",positive
"I purchased two certified nook colors directly from B&N;, for my kids to read ebooks on, and for some entertainment on long trips, Dr's appts, etc.Things I like about the device:-versatility- now has netflix- great little device for entertainment, as well as reading.-user interface:  much improved following the last update, both navigating the device itself and B&N;'s store.-option for expandable storage- handy for music and mp4's.-ability to make the device 'kid friendly'; the internet can be disabled, and purchases can be made to require your account password.Things I dislike about the device:-Read in store feature only for certain books, and virtually no kids' books.  The impression I got from B&N;'s webpage was that it was for all ebooks.  This was the main reason why I picked these up instead of waiting for the Kindle Fire to be released.  Major disappointment.-Charger cable sucks.  The cable itself is weak where the usb adapter attaches to the cable, and is very easy to bend and break.  one cable is now broken at that spot, and the other is close to it.  These cables are easily replaceable, so not a huge deal, but I expected better quality...  Also, the power adapter is quite bulky.-did not update automatically.  I had to manually install the most recent update (allowing me to disable internet, and install netflix). it was relatively easy to do, following directions from B&N;'s webpage, but there should be a way to check for updates from the device itself.-loses battery life fairly quickly while on standby.-no free games & limited games (maybe apple spoiled me...)-prices for apps and books seem generally higher than on my kindle (I have not made direct comparisons, this is just my general impression)I will try and see if I can lend books through my local library; this may allow me to use it more for it's intended purpose.Overall, the device itself is quite good- just not for what I had intended it for (in store reading- with the option to purchase the book, in print, from the store).If I had purchased the device for myself, however, it would have been returned.  My kids do enjoy reading on it, playing angry birds, watching netflix, etc. so I will keep it for their use.Edit:The nook colours use a usb longer than a standard micro usb; a standard micro usb cable will not charge the nook colour.  I did contact B&N; (I initially took my nooks into a B&N; store for assistance, and was referred to their tech support 1-800 number.  So much for the in store tech support...)  I was able to recieve two new cables under warranty, though.I am generally happy with the tech support provided over the phone, but am still disappointed by the quality of the charging cable, and the inability of B&N; to solve this issue in-store.",positive
"I am the occasional reader but, I bought this for tablet capability.  It can be rooted in about 2 minutes to have app store.  Once that is done, You can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering B&N; store.  It's still there but, not right in my face. Default browser is OK  but, I prefer Dolphin HD.  It's much more than half and Ipad at exactly half the price.  Plus, when used as a reader, it's just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose.  I had a Pandigital novel that I got for Xmas that completely died in 3 weeks.  I took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that I can remember making:  The Nook Color.  The novel is pure garbage compared to this device.  Android 2.1 is so much better than 1.6.  I also couldn't get many apps to run on the novel  where this runs almost everything. Spend the extra $ and get the color.  Save the extra money from the Ipad. I was considering Archos 70 but, I couldn't find anywhere to actually play with it.  Plus, given their history; I had decided against it.Good:Nice screen,  capacitive touch,  strong wifi, decent battery life, Nice CPU @ 800 MHz,  512 MB RAM  Ipad only has 256  supposedly), Tons of free apps available, very reasonably priced,  portable,  Barnes and Noble magazines  very reasonably priced at $1 to $3 an issue), microsd slot.Bad  minor complaints):that silly plastic thing in the corner, mono speaker, micorsd slot instead of sdhc card slot, doesn't come with android market.Overall this is the best tablet for the money currently and probably will be for quite a while.UPDATE.  Couple of small annoyances: randomly reboots instead of sleeping, wireless doesn't come back up sometimes after rebooting.  Still very happy with it though. Sleep issue apparently also happens to those who haven't rooted.  I'm sure it will be fixed with update.UPDATE:  I am very unhappy with Barnes and Noble's many attempts to update my firmware without my permission.  They have tried twice and didn't succeed.  I believe that AVG antivirus is stopping it.  They got my girlfriend's and we have the same nook, that came with same firmware, that was flashed with same mod.  The only thing I can think of was AVG must have stopped it.  They got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine.  She wasn't running AVG and mine was.  It's the only thing I can think of.Who else does that?  I have items from Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, HTC (Sprint), etc and NONE of them update my property.  Who do these people think they are? Well, they won't be updating my firmware and now I won't be buying books from them either.  Anyway, it's an aging piece of hardware and now for a bit more money something better can be bought.Side Note:  I had ordered a touchpad from B&N; back on AUgust 21st.  Not only did I not get one, they cancelled my order for me without so much as an email.  Not very nice.",positive
"I have had my color nook for three  months. Its fine for reading but the kindle is cheaper and the nook is  sure not a tablet, you cant get free apps, if you want an app from your tv station, guess what, if BN isnt selling it you cant  get it, thats why they sell these things , so you have to buy from them. I found free ebooks on the web, and down load to my pc as pdf files and drag them to the nook. [...] is very good. The  pages change size of their own freewill, which is very annoying, and the battery life is awful, if you use wifi you have to recharge every day. Yahoo mail is awful on the nook, gmail is fine and hotmail is too. As far as the web, email is all it good for. I wish I had bought and Archos tablet, all the things I am doing now plus a lot more.",positive
"I have had the opportunity to test both nook color and kindle fire. My favorite is the kindle fire...1.) poor customer service from barnes and noble - the cable breaks easily, and this device is not compatible for swaps... what I mean is like on the kindles you can basically switch out the cables for any micro usb cable... nook color you can not do that... once your nook color is out of warranty, they will no longer replace the cable, so if it breaks, your like SOL until you buy another one for $19.95 + shipping + tax... The cable is really cheap and breaks to easily... I think each time I've had a new cable replaced I could only get it to last about 2-3 uses before it broke... it keeps breaking at the N...2.) the updates are horrible... basically you will have lag issues and the battery will drain easy if you don't update... actually after a while the battery will just start draining anyways and you can't keep charge...3.) it takes forever to turn on... you have to wait like 5 minutes and keep holding the power button and then like another 5 minutes to boot up... with kindle it turns on almost instantly.... After a while, you still have to wait about a minute for the kindle to boot up, but it still loads quicker than the nook color.4.) a feature i like is that the volume buttons are on the side... with kindle fire, you have to dig around to find them... they are in the settings... like you can only adjust the volume on kindle fire through the settings...5.) another feature i like is the card expansion slot. i like to store avi movies from my camcorder and what not on them, and you can't do that with the kindle fire.6.) check each stores content before you buy. each ereader loads different files... this is the main reason i bought both. Most of my textbooks for school are only available through barnes and noble, but I prefer to read on the kindle. After I'm done with school, I'm going to be selling my nook color, but I refuse to get rid of my kindle fire, unless they update to one that has the volume buttons on the side, and plossibly a card expansion slot. For me, i actually found out that most of the content I liked was available through amazon for free, and it cost at B&N;, so that may be another influence for when you decide to purchase... It's just I wish that amazon would just carry all the textbooks I need, so I don't have to keep going to b&n...;So, other than the software is a tiny bit easier to navigate around, i'd prefer kindle fire over nook any day... just because I get longer lasting supplies and better customer service.",positive
"The NOOKColor is awesome- it plays music, is expandable, displays gorgeous color, allows you to surf the internet (not optimally, but the ability is there), and is mostly easy to navigate. From me, it gets a solid 4 stars. The problem is that as an eReader, it's already overpriced, and the Amazon sellers who offer it are asking ridiculous amounts. It's cheaper (and ships free) from Barnes and Noble. Amazon is usually #1 at everything, including price, and I already own two Kindles (I would buy the Kindle in color if it came that way) but the price being charged for the NOOKColor on Amazon is absurd.",positive
"I've held off on an e-book reader for a long time. The Kindle was always too expensive and, even now, I don't like the way the screen flashes when ""turning"" pages. After playing around with many different readers, over a period of several weeks, I finally decided to pick up a Nook a couple of months ago.One of my big considerations is that I wanted to be able to read .pdf files in color. The Nook easily satisfied that requirement. What I was expecting; however, is how FANTASTIC the Nook is after Android is installed on it. A friend of my just bought a new iPad 2 and showed it to me a couple of days ago. That, of course, is a wonderful device but VERY expensive. I started to look around the 'net and found that the latest Android Operating System, Honeycomb, can be installed on a micro-SD memory card and that this will allow the Nook to run the new OS. Even better, by simply removed the micro-SD card, the Nook returns to it's normal state and continues to run as before.I had NO IDEA how powerful the Nook Color really is until I installed Honeycomb on it. The Nook is now so great that it behooves me that B & N doesn't simply place Android on the Nook as the default OS! Yes, it's its that good! Just one word of caution. As using Honeycomb doesn't require that the Nook be rooted, it is a bit tricky to install but that's only due to the HORRIBLE instructions that the geeks who discovered how to put Android on the it. (As a rule, Geeks are usually incapable of writing in known-human languages.) I don't know if the warranty is voided by running Honeycomb but, as all that needs to done to get rid of it, is remove the micro-SD card, I suspect that no one will know.All in all, the Nook Color was already a great device but adding Honeycomb makes it AMAZING!",positive
I have never been a big fan of reading until I purchased the nook.  I have trouble putting it down.  I'm either playing games or reading.  Absolutely love it.,positive
"I haven't really given up my Kindle (which I love and has its advantages). However, I got a deal on a Nook Color that was impossible to ignore and so I made the jump. If you're wondering if it's worth 2X the price, IMO it depends on your needs and wants. For people who want to create an inexpensive e-reader/Android tablet by rooting the Nook -- or if you love to read periodicals or books with lots of images -- the Nook Color is the way to go.It's surprisingly heavy to hold -- MUCH heavier than my Kindle with a cover. The battery life means you CAN'T be far away from an electrical plugin. My last charge lasted 2+ days with playing games, an animated screensaver and some reading. It's also wireless only.The backlit LCD screen is spectacular and I find it was better on my eyes for reading than I expected. However, I find that finding ebooks on B&N;'s site is harder than Amazon and I cannot find many inexpensive or the oodles of free ebooks like for Kindle. Lots of ebooks promoted on B&N;'s Nookstore are $4.99 - $9.99 or more. Too expensive, IMO. Seems like fewer Indie Authors on there in the $2.99 price range :(I decided to take a chance and rooted my new Nook Color which requires a micro SD card (I used a 2G card). It requires the ability to follow some technical steps that took me about 15 minutes total. I am not a major Geek, but I've been online for 15 years and know basic stuff like HTML (not needed for this) and moving files and some troubleshooting if I get stuck. The Rooted Nook is a bit quirky. While the original B&N; e-reader functionality is still there, I had to install a couple apps (launcher app and Softkeys) to toggle between the Android and B&N; screens.I CAN watch YouTube and surf the web easily. I also downloaded the Amazon Kindle app to my rooted Nook, and read my 100+ Kindle books on it (and get my freebies too!). You can't view Flash or use Hulu or Netflix (yet!), but maybe flash will work with the next B&N; update. note that a Nook Color doesn't have a mic or bluetooth to use with certain Android apps. A bummer for me because I like to dictate texts and emails on my phone using Nuance's FlexT9 app.Overall, my kids **love** the Android side of the rooted Nook Color, and I like getting some useful apps on a much bigger screen. So now we fight over it. Will I get rid of my Kindle -- no way. But I find the Nook Color becoming more my at home reader with the Kindle app on it, and my Kindle device turning into an away from home, travel e-reader.",positive
"I have had my Nook for 5 months and the only issue I have had with it is the charger cord went bad, but I called the toll free number and they are sending me a new one for free. I'm am lost without it! I have an Easy Reader from Nook, but this is so much better.",positive
"Pros:1). Excellent color screen2). Firmware Update to Android Froyo 2.1 allows for minor expansion of capabilities3). Responsive touch screen during reading4). Good, sturdy construction5). Exapandable memory with MicroSD card slot6). Weight is slightly heavy, but not too bad at all.Cons:1).  Although it can play videos on the internet, videos are otherwise extremely hard to find that fit the format for the player.  For example, Amazon.com Instant Video plays .wmv files, which is not a compatible format.  Converting these files to another format is next to impossible, since Amazon.com instant video doesn't support the Nook Color.  Amazon.com, CinemaNow (through Best Buy), and even Itunes movies are all DRM protected and won't run on the Nook Color due to lack of support (trust me, I've tried them all).2).  Not connected to Android app store...Barnes and Noble currently (as of 5/11/11) only has 148 apps in their ""Nook Apps Store"".Overall: B+The Color Nook is a great e-reader with inernet capabilities and limited android Apps.  Although a Android Firmware update was released in May 2011, the limitations of the device can be seen through lack of impressive apps and extreme lack of ""Other-than-internet"" video playback, put the Color Nook down a coulpe of notches in my book.  Overall though, this is an impressive e-reader for the novice user who is looking for a light travel device that can offer internet connectivity and decent battery life.",positive
"Before I get started, I'll just say that my review comes from the unit we got at the bookstore to display. The overall product will still be the same, but some things (like the instruction manual) might be different.---------Reading: It's a nice clean picture & the backlit screen isn't too annoying, but I have a feeling that people will be feeling the eyestrain later. If you're looking to buy this for reading at length, you'll need to be aware of this. You can change the brightness of the page, but that doesn't change that ultimately you're still looking at a backlit screen.Downloading: Pretty fast download times, although I only downloaded the free samples from the storefront. (Hilarious since I work at a Books-A-Million & the storefront's B&N.; We're so going to lose money on ebook sales.)Internet: Pretty decent. I pulled up facebook & the page is crisp, clear & loads quickly. I also went onto failblog, a site with quite a few side ads. It was a little on the slow side, but that's to be expected on stuff like this. You can also pull up videos on youtube, so that's a bonus.Battery: Not bad, but obviously won't last as long as the Nook or some of the e-ink units out there. You'll get about 3-4 hours if you leave the wifi on. Not sure about the non-wifi battery life right now, but since the company says it's 8 hours I'd say it's probably about 6-7 hours.Extras: You can change the font, screen background color, & a few other things. While that's nice, I couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed by it. There's also the option to be able to toggle back & forth between the publisher default & your aesthetics of choice. You can also change the background on the main page of the NookColor, which is a nice touch. Since we're not supposed to change that with our store unit, I wasn't able to play with that any.Touch Screen: It's OK. Pretty easy to use, but a few times I found myself really having to wrestle with it to turn pages. Sometimes it would be too sensitive & I'd end up a few pages ahead of where I wanted to be. Not a deal breaker, though. It didn't happen enough to where I'd get overly irritated, but people who are all thumbs with touch screens will be irritated.User Friendly: It's not very intuitive to use. People savvy with e-readers & gadgets will be able to figure it out pretty quickly but people who are new to the scene will be pretty confused with everything. The unit for my store didn't come with any written directions- it was all on the unit. That means that if it's like this on the sale unit then that won't be all that helpful for the people who aren't able to navigate well on the unit.Overall: My opinion is that it's OK, but not exceptionally so. Go for the iPad if you really want something like this. (I know it's more expensive, but if you're willing to pay $300 then paying $500 might not be that much of a difference.) It's basically a Nook/iPad hybrid, but without the option for all of the extras & apps. (Of course if all you want is an e-reader & wouldn't use the iPad's extras, then this is great.) Overall it isn't a bad unit but it just doesn't have anything to really make it stand out. If you're a big fan of the Nook then go for this unit, but I'd play with it in the store first.The only two things that really make this stand out from the other e-readers on the market is that the unit is in color and that the internet on this unit is far better than some of the other options on the e-reader market. While the color option is great for children's books & magazines, this might not be enough for users who predominantly use their readers for plain print reading & that the ones who would want these things might already have it in the various tablets that are on the market.I did enjoy playing with the unit in my store, but I don't know that I would choose it over the regular Nook. Of course this is just my opinion, but again- before making a big purchase like this, view a unit in the store first.3.9/5",positive
"I'll admit, I bought it to hack it.  If you have no interest in hacking this device, then let me start with the ""stock"" review first.As an eBook reader, it is very good but not great.  eInk and its variants will always be the gold standard by which you measure a reading device, because the utility of such a display in daylight is unrivaled.  My hope is that in time, the Pixel Qi displays make their way into Kindles, Nooks, iPads, etc on such a large scale that this is no longer an issue.  Alas, it remains one, and it is a key criterion for many.  As an LCD touch screen, it is very bright and colors are rich, not saturated.  Touch sensitivity is a little rough, as is accuracy.  I did not see a calibration function.Wireless connectivity is very, very good but for some reason, will not connect with some routers.  The range is impressive, better than my Droid 2.  Speeds are very good, but I neglected a speedtest in this round.Integration with the B&N; store is very tight as expected.  The store app for the Nook is better than the Android app, necessarily: you can browse magazines and newspapers, for one thing.  Display of media is well-formatted and fairly intuitive; I never cracked the user manual or quick start guide (then again, I rarely do that for anything I buy). Prices are competitive with other vendors, and it does handle sideloading of books onto microSD cards.  By the way, 32Gb microSDs are supported.  I run with an 8Gb, and I've filled it mostly with music.And oh by the way, it plays music very well.  Some of you might listen to music while you read, and I am one of those weirdos.  This device, stock, will do just that.  Overall, I like this device, but would probably prefer eInk if I was buying it solely for reading media.However, I bought it for cheap tablet use.  In this regard, it has amazing potential.  Despite the fragmentation of custom ROM and rooting options, you can indeed settle on a Cyanogen ROM and find a lot of functionality on the cheap.  I can browse websites easily if I don't need Flash (currently not working on this ROM); I use PocketCloud to log into my home machines and I can work from there if needed.  I'd love to have Swype on this, or even Graffiti, but it is sufficient to have access to the Android Marketplace and all the attendant apps I have stored in the cloud.  There is no microphone or camera, so those apps have no place here, nor does GPS exist.  However, Bluetooth is available in Cyanogen nightlies so you can now try pairing it with headsets and keyboards.  Thus far, the potential is not fully realized but it perfectly suits my needs today.  With time, this will become a great tablet once Flash is fully operable and the Honeycomb ROMs are fully baked.Stock, 4 stars.  Hacked, 5 stars, tremendous value.-C",positive
"First off, do not expect Nook Color to do wonders.  It is not meant to be tablet or an iPad replacement.  It is foremost an e-Reader with some bells and whistles.If I'm given a choice, I would not buy a Nook.  For the price, I would rather get a Kindle Fire.  I own 4 laptops, 1 iPad 2 for my wife, and 3 Kindle Fires for my kids.  Nook Color is an afterthought and it is for me.  I bought my used Nook Color on another site for $114 (free shipping) 2 weeks ago.  And it was a steal.  The Nook I received was in working order and it looked new.I had no trouble turning it on and everything worked perfectly.  The only gripe was it was extremely slow compare to some of the tablets I own.  Again, I reminded myself that this is not a tablet so I had to be fair.  The features are not too bad but the navigation was confusing at best.Fast forward to today.  B&N; was smart to release an update (1.4.1).  If you already own a Nook Color, you should get the update.  The update improves the speed dramatically.  The navigation still lacks finesse though.Here are some of the goods- I bought it cheap- It has an expansion slot.  I inserted a 16GB micro SD card and Nook recognizes it right away.- The web works fine.  It can now even watch some YouTube.  It also runs Flash.  Nook 1, iPad 0.- The new update allows NetFlix to run.- There are some apps that are extremely useful.  I love the Smithsonian Channel and Pulse.- The magazines look great.  The update also improve the navigation.- The interactive books are great.  My daughter absolutely loves it.And now the bads- I constantly look for free stuff.  Unfortunately, B&N; doesn't offer a lot of free books that are worthwhile.- The apps itself, is sad to say the least.  The offering is a fraction of what you can find in iPad and Amazon.  And most of them are costly too.- While the update improve the speed of web-surfing, it still is slower than iPad and Kindle Fire.- The speaker is terrible.  It is located on the back of the device.  If you hold the Nook on your hand, you may cover the speaker. The best solution is to use a head phone.- The navigation overall needs to be improved. It is a basic Android without much thought.  At times I don't even know whether to double-tap or hold to get more options.Here is my final take.  If you are short on cash, and would like a good e-reader/tablet.  Go get a Kindle.  If you can find a Nook for less than $150. Go for it.I would not spend more than $200 on a Nook (be it a Color/Tablet).  There are much better options out there.Update January 24, 2012I have used my Nook for a month now and all in all, I like it because it allows me to read my magazines and books.  It sure beats a 10 incher tablet.  The update 1.4.1 is definitely a must if you want to use Nook Color to its full potential.  However, I found out yesterday that the update was actually used to close the loop on dual-boot and disable any sideload of apps.  The version 1.4.0 allows the Nook to load Amazon app and the Launcher EX.  Basically it allows other apps other than B&N; to be loaded.  The automatic update 1.4.1 disable this option.  So, if you are dare enough to install other apps, you can backdate the version to 1.4.0 if you want to load other apps.Update February, 2012Nook continues to lose to Kindle Fire in terms of contents.  B&N; could not match to the behemoth of Amazon and I don't think it will ever be.  However, if you are stuck with Nook, there are a few apps that you must have (they are all free).  It helps the Nook Color to be a good companion in a boring world.- NetFlix is a must.  7 inch on your lap and plug in a pair of headphones.  You are good to go.- Smithsonian is interesting.  Want to learn something that you forgot.  This app works great but contents updates are slow.- Dolphin Internet Explorer works great for anyone wants to do quick surfing.  Very fast and very convenient.- Don't know what interest you, try Stumbleupon.  It randomly pulls internet content based on your interest.  Works great on YouTube vidoes.- Good with words, try Nook Crossword.- Who doesn't use Dropbox.  It is a must.- Springpad is great to jot down quick notes.- Pandora works great too, but you need a pair of headphones though.- Who needs newspaper when you have Pulse.",positive
"I purchased this for my wife a week ago as an anniversary gift.  I already have a Nook ST and an IPAD2.  It was a very simple setup.  The colors are stunning and the build quality is excellent.  It is not as fast as my IPAD2 but it's no slouch either.  The screen is very responsive to the touch.  The Nook Color is perfect for someone who is looking for a device that is optimized for ebooks yet allows email, web-surfing, and video.  It even does flash which my IPAD2 doesn't.  I probably won't root it because for my wife's purposes it pretty much does everything she needs, but it can be rooted and used as a full fledged Android tablet.  I really like this device.  It is a little on the heavy side for an ereader but it is a great value for $250. I would definitely recommend it to others.",positive
"EDIT - Update 1.4.1 (12/21/2011): BIG update rolled out on December 14th, with lots of big changes, most of which really improved the device.First, the ""n"" key, which originally functioned as a home key taking you back to the original home screen, now functions as the menu key instead, like on the new Nook Tablet. Prior, there was a softkey arrow that would bring up the menu function, and Barnes and Noble has moved that function to strictly hardware. I'm torn about whether I like this update, because honestly, I don't like relying just on a hardware key for something like a menu, especially with the issues I've had with Nook parts (I've owned two cords in the past year alone.) It does makes multi-taking easier, when switching from one application to another (say reading to internet), because you don't have to go to the home menu function first. For those of us Nook Color originals, it takes adjusting from old habits, but so far, it's not a bad change.The reader application functions in a much more friendly manner. The page numbers are on the bottom of the pages, instead of the top, in a much less chintzy font, and pulling up the menu tell you how many more pages are left in the chapter. Not really a necessary change, but kind of nice. There are some fonts added, along with FINALLY adding the option to change the tone of the page from white to sepia, night, or off-white. The books also read sideways now, in a two-page fashion, though I'll admit, I don't use that much, and won't, even with the ability to have it on something other than kids books. Just makes the actual reader app a much more rounded and friendly one.The magazine reader had a few changes that are nice. There are animations for the page turns now (though why they don't have that option with the books is a big of an in-congruency), though the animations disappear when you zoom in. The menu at the bottom pulls up the pages in miniature picture form, but are in a much more appealing, accessible manner. Rather Mac-esque, really. Nothing huge, but it makes it all more friendly-looking. Randomly, the magazine reading app is the only one where the ""n"" button is still a home button, and not a menu one. Wondering if they'll notice that and change it in the future.The PDF reader had some AWESOME changes. Before, reading PDF files was incredibly clunky, and did not resolve well on the screen at all. Reading a book involved zooming in and scrolling down, instead of sideways like the ereader application, and when you closed the PDF file, reopening would take you right back to page one, and never saved your last place. Ridiculously cumbersome, and not user-friendly at all. The new update not only saves your place, but it resolves the page so that the text fits better on the screen, and allows the pages to read much more easily sideways. It also scrolls sideways, instead of down, which just makes sense and follows with the overall expectations of the reading experience.Interestingly, enough, they still haven't resolved the issue of PDF files not having a cover when on the home screen or in the menu, even when the information is attached, which is something I was hoping they'd resolve. It's not a huge issue, but it's just a visual annoyance when all the EPUB files have cool graphics show up on the home screen, and PDF files just have grey with the title of the book. Lame.Overall performance of the menu functions and flipping between tasks seems zippier than it was before, and I really appreciate that. The menu functions seem much more efficient and smooth, and that just makes for a much better interaction.The ebook store also changed around, and B&N; completely reordered all the categories and changed the look. I can't say I appreciate all the changes they made, because you can no longer organize things like apps or books based on price, and instead have to search manually in the menu. I'm frugal, I'll admit. I miss the ability to find free apps easily, because let's face it, it just makes me happy.Overall, I love the update they rolled out, though! It's nice to know that B&N; is staying loyal to their original customers and keeping the devices updated.*  *  *EDIT 4/12/2011: Barnes and Noble did an update recently which fixed the glitches with the screen when plugged in, finally. I have not had any issues with the screen lagging or glitching since.*  *  *EDIT 2/28/2011: A new update now allows for Android apps and email on the Nook, which is exciting. I'm not all that into the apps they have, especially the games, but it's a nice touch! It has also fixed the issue of not being able to put your own books on the home screen, and the issue that the Nook was having with recognizing cover art for those books. I can now also put other apps on the home screen, such as the Email or Pandora app, which gives the entire thing a much freer, most customizable feel. Though apparently this update has cancelled out the last one, because the screen glitches when plugged in are back. Oh, well, I'm just happy to now be able to put my own books on my own home screen! Vast improvement right there!*  *  *Original review, from 12/2010:I received my Nook Color as a gift for an early Christmas, and have been using it for a few weeks now, enough time that I decided I can make an educated review.Pros/Cons-It has a great screen, with sharp resolution. Book title colors and wallpapers look sharp and clear, and the touchscreen is responsive. You can adjust the brightness, though I rarely found the need to adjust the brightness even a quarter of what it could be, since otherwise it was a bit too bright on the eyes. That being said, I found that when you plug it in to a power source and try and use it, the touchscreen goes crazy, and won't even perform simple tasks like unlocking the device. You can't flip to the next screen without several swipes, and turning pages can be a haphazard activity. That weird glitch doesn't affect the device at all when it isn't connected to a power source, but it's such a pain when the device is low on battery power and you want to read while it's charging.-The hardware on the Nook Color is nice, with a muted metallic finish on the front and back, which gives it a nice grip, though I immediately bought a cover, so the fact that it's somewhat grippy doesn't matter much any longer. The weight is nice, about the weight of a small hardcover book, which I found rather pleasant when holding. I still don't get the random open-hole thing in the lower left-hand corner, though. It's like you're supposed to use that to clip the device onto something, but I hardly thing someone is going to just clip it onto their keychain for convenience. It's clearly not awful-looking, but I guess it just seems kind of superfluous to me. Oh, well.-The battery life is surprisingly good. I don't have to WiFi on when I'm at home, and the device will go for several days on low-brightness. I actually had it on one charge for about 7 days one time, and was pretty impressed, considering other devices with LCD features tend to eat battery life like some kids eat Cocoa Puffs.-It's Android-based, which is great. However, B&N; doesn't allow any apps from the Android market, which is such a crime, considering that the tablet could be a fantastic tool if B&N; would open up the gates on that one. The fact that it's Android-based isn't really a selling point, it's more of a potential point to keep an eye on, one that hopefully the company will do more with down the road. The tablet does come with certain apps like Pandora and games like Sudoku, which will do in a pinch if you're bored.-It comes WiFi enabled, and it connects to networks easily and without issues. It does recognize B&N; WiFi hot-spots, and remembers them, which means that you don't have to reprogram the networks or worry about not being able to access the in-store features, which is really convenient. The browser is pretty decent, doesn't have flash, but performs very well. I actually used it for emails and checking my Facebook when I was out of town, and it was snappy and quick, though the fact that it doesn't have pinch/pull zooming features (which the picture gallery does, oddly enough) is a bit of a turn-off, because it can make browsing somewhat clunky and inaccurate.-The B&N; store they have on the device is convenient, loads content easily, and is very user-friendly to navigate. Once you have your information in, downloads are quick and easy, and you can also set a password for downloads, to prevent someone downloading books without approval. Also, if you have a gift card for B&N;, you can use it to buy books, but you have to go online to your account first, and save the information on your account before it'll charge it, and it'll always charge to that card first before your credit card, which is a pretty cool feature.-The reader itself is awesome, and you can sideload your EPUB files easily onto the device from your computer and start reading them immediately. You can't, however, read PUB files like you can on a regular Nook, which I found obnoxious, since I have a lot of eBooks in that format (that are from a B&N; affiliated website, no less). You also can't put files that HAVEN'T been downloaded directly from the B&N; store on the device over WiFi onto your home screen, so in order to pull up your own personal files sideloaded onto the device (even ones downloaded directly from B&N; online), you have to go into the Bookshelf menu and go from there. Which means that if you don't have WiFi all the time (as I do), very few of your books will be able to be put on your home screen, which is such a childish thing for B&N; to do, really. It takes away the personalization that the tablet could do so well, and bothered the heck out of me when I first discovered it. Granted, you could probably fix it by rooting the device, but you run the risk of other issues in the software when you do that, so hopefully B&N; will come out with an update to fix that annoyance.-The Nook does read PDF files, but it's a very awkward process, since the screen ratio doesn't fit the allotted size, making the text tiny and incomprehensible, so trying to reads books in that format is a headache; zooming in is awkward and clunky, and takes to long to be worth the effort. Also, closing and reopening the file takes you back to the first page, which, if you're attempting to read an extensive document in several sittings, gets really old really fast. If you have book in PDF form, I would suggest downloading something like Calibre and converting them to EPUB to save yourself the trouble.-Music loads and plays easily, though I honestly haven't used that feature much, since I have an iPod, and if I want a playlist, I go from there. Pictures also load easily, though you have to have it in the gallery/grid feature to see previews, otherwise they are just displayed with file type images until you click on them to open. Silly little issue, but again, something B&N; will hopefully fix in the future.Anyway, great product, but really, more potential than actual greatness at this point. I love the fact that I don't have to leave the house to read a book, which is great since I'm at home with an infant all the time. Is it worth the money? If you buy it directly from B&N; online, it's $249, which isn't an awful price for touchscreen reader (it's really only about $100 more than a regular Nook or Kindle), so I would say that yes, it is. It's just still somewhat disappointing that it feels like it's half-finished, but I'm looking forward to see where it all goes from here.",positive
"For me, this is a better purchase than the Kindle Fire. I just bought this Nook color tablet from Best Buy two days ago,  It's perfect.  After charging it, I drove straight to Barnes & Noble books to try their wifi and buy a few books. TRUST ME, THE Barnes & Noble bookstore employees know how to operate the Noook, and did a better job than Best Buy, at showing me how to use the Nook and answer my questions.  The set up and navigation is easy, and the user settings are user friendly. When reading books, I found that the bright white background screen was hurting my eyes.  So I lowered the brightness level down to half of the default setting.  Yes, you can adjust the brightness as well as the volume.  Nice Browser: when using the browser, it accesses the internet very quick.  While using the wifi in the B&N store, I accessed Hulu plus (The video website).  I was in the Barnes & noble store watching an episode of Law & Order.  HOW COOL IS THAT?  The weight is a little haavy in your hand when reading books, but no where near as heavy as the Kindle Fire.  The kindle fire was both thick & too heavy.  On the kindle fire's screen, I had to fight & tap several times to change screens. I grew frusrtated, took the kindle back to Best Buy the same day, and exchanged it for the Nook.  I'm so glad I did.  On the nook, changing screens only requires a smooth tap.  In summary, unless you need a tablet for business purposes, the Nook ereader tablet is your perfect companion when traveling.",positive
"I picked this up as a gift for my teen son. It looks great and makes a nice web browser. I checked and found that it has 1.8 million FREE books! (actually more like 700,000 as there are repeated titles). After setting up my account (which would be changed to my son's after Christmas) I tried to download a free book (Sherlock Holmes, The Invisible man...) but B&N; requires a credit card number, on file, to charge the $0.00 price to.Here's my problem: my teen son isn't getting my credit card number. There's no work around either. I suppose that the B&N; site would require a confirmation password, as Amazon does, but, personally, I prefer entering my CC# upon a purchase instead of creating a running tab for myself or my son.I'd love to give this to my son, but it requires that I give him access to my CC number to download free books and the temptation to be financially irresponsible is just too great. If anyone has had their identity or CC#'s stolen, you can see why this is a deal breaker.",positive
"am about to get a micro card with android c7 and use it as a reader and tablet.  this let's me get rid of my netbook,nook wi/fi and router which free's up space and let's me use it anywhere in the house.  hope it's a good move.  cape guy",positive
"I have been down and up with this reader for the past 5 months, but since April, it has been a joy.  B&N; has gotten its act together.  The problem I had with not being able to open books has been solved. B&N; not only finally found out what caused some books to lock up but also how to restore them.  There is no longer any problem with opening any books.When I first bought my reader, the tech support people were not well-trained. They are now.  I have 80 books on it and no problems with any of them.Now, the goodies:  B&N; just introduced Enhanced Editions of some books. These have videos, audio clips, animated maps, etc.embedded in the text.  It's wonderful.  I'm reading D-Day, and throughout there are newsreel segments pertinent to the text.  For instance, you read about Eisenhower and then play the video of him talking to his troops before they embark for the Normandy Coast.  You don't just read about bombing or fighting,you hear and see as well. It's a whole new reading experience and available only on the NOOKcolor (or the iPad with the NOOK app.)Pictures in magazines like National Geographic are gorgeous.  They look better than the print versions. There is a selection of apps for the NOOKcolor, with more coming out all the time.However, if you want all the Android apps, then  you can get an N2A SD card on Amazon that turns your NOOKcolor into a full Android tablet with access to the Market. You then  have the option of booting the reader up as a NOOKcolor or an Android Tablet.  You can even get a Kindle App so you can get and read books from Kindle on your NOOKcolor.Some people say that the backlit screen has glare and that you can't read it outdoors.  Not true.  I read my NOOKcolor in my sunny back yard all the time, and, although I'm a 76 year old lady, I can read for hours on it with no problem.Now for the goodies besides the Enhanced Editions.  You can get an app that allows you to work on Office documents on your reader.  Downloading files, pictures, and music is a breeze.The NOOK also allows you to borrow ebooks from public libraries.  All you need is a library card.  Libraries all over the US are lending ebooks.  So, you don't have to buy all the books you want to read.  That's a big saving. And, it takes less than a minute to download a  book.  You just connect your reader with a USB cord and Adobe Digital Editions displays the books you've borrowed & you drag the ones you want to the My NOOKcolor shelf.  As with Kindle, there is also a Lend Me feature so that your friends can borrow from you.The touch screen is very sensitive and I'm very clumsy, so it took me awhile to be able to navigate easily, rapidly, and without bringing up unwanted menus.  But that was true of the iPhone when I got my first one,Why don't I go all the way  and give this 5 stars?  Because the device doesn't have a ""sync to farthest point read"" feature, so if you decide to look at an earlier page,the only way to get back is to use this awkward slider bar.  I can never get it to stop at just the page I want.  The same is true of clicking on endnotes.  When you're through reading them, you have to navigate backwards to the text. There is a Back button displayed on the Notes page, but it disappears before you can read your note.  B&N; has some work to do on this.In sum, if you buy it at Barnes and Noble, the NOOKcolor is only $249, half the price of the cheapest iPad or even Android Tablets.  Yet, for $39.95 more you can get the card to turn it into a full Android Tablet.  It is incredibly more versatile than the Kindle. Page turning is smoother than on the Kindle--or am I the only one who sees the afterimage of the page you're going from while you're turning pages on the Kindle?  On the NOOKcolor, like the iPad, you just touch and you're  on the next page.One other thing: naturally, a touch screen will get smudged.  B&N; says to wipe it with a dry microfiber cloth.  I found that didn't clean it enough.  If the screen isn't clean, it can get jumpy.  So, knowing that the iPhone has a capacitative touch screen as does the NOOKcolor, I tried using the products sold in the Apple Store to clean the screen.  They work perfectly.As mentioned in my earlier review, I also like the NOOKcolor feature of your being able to share a passage with a friend without leaving the page you're reading.  Also, I find the Web browser is just fine. In fact, when I'm  reading and see a name or word I need more info on, I just touch it and when the popup appears, I choose Wikipedia or Google and surf to my heart's content. Then I just touch the ""book"" icon on the lower screen and I'm back to the page I was reading.  It's smooth and fast.I belong to Goodreads and when I'm through with a book, I can just go to the Goodreads app on my NOOKcolor and post my review immediately. Small touch, but nice.",positive
"My friend loves her nook.I purchased it as a gift to my friend,already own one.",positive
"This is my first E-Reader, so my target audience for this review are primarily those who are also considering this relatively new technology.MY INITIAL REQUIREMENTS:In anticipation of some heavy travel, I decided that I needed something that would allow me to purchase and store enough books to last me 6 months. More importantly, I wanted something that would allow me to highlight and take notes on passages. Finally, if the physical copy of a book had pictures in it, I wanted to be able to see those pictures on my E-Reader.WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE NOOK:--One of the first things to attract me to the Nook was its simplicity. There are only 4 buttons to be seen: A power button, Volume Up, Volume Down and the Nook ""Menu"" button. The buttons are inconspicuous and don't protrude.--I was able to download almost all of the books I was looking for from the B&N; shop. To be fair, some of the stuff I read is relatively obscure.--I like the ability to highlight passages with different colors and take notes.--I like that it shows pictures from books.--Although it wasn't something I was looking for at the start of my E-Reader search, I found that I liked the built-in games (Chess, Sudoku, Crossword puzzles, etc).--Finally, the touchscreen is pretty responsive (not perfect) and the menus are mostly intuitive.A FEW THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE NOOK:--As mentioned earlier, the touchscreen is good, but not perfect. It can be really touchy and trying if you're trying to get a certain passage highlighted. Even more difficult is trying to navigate web pages using the browser. I don't recommend the Nook as a Netbook or iPad replacement, but it is nice if all you use it for is downloading more books or reading some online news.--Pictures from physical books sometimes show up on the Nook version of the book. When they do (like maps in fantasy novels) they are usually much, much smaller. Unfortunately all the Nook books I've seen don't allow you to resize or zoom in on these maps or pictures.OVERALL:For the most part, the Nook met my initial requirements. Some things I didn't think I'd use much before (Chess, etc) I actually use fairly often and will come in handy to pass away the time on a long plane flight or layover.If you want something that will just read books, then I'm sure you can find something better. Likewise, despite all the extra feature that the Nook has, it is no threat to the iPad.But for those that are looking for something in-between, the Nook is a handsome, intuitive and reasonably priced alternative.",positive
"My wife loves this, and it's one of the best Christmas presents you can give to someone who truly likes to read.",positive
"I really like Amazon and wanted this for my wife for Christmas but why would the change MORE than buying direct from B&N;?I like the service and everything I have experienced with Amazon but I would not pay $65 MORE (?!) than going direct to B&N.;Sorry this time Amazon, I just went to B&N;.",positive
The nook provides a lot of hidden features.. I read a couple reviews and Im still learning more about the product. Challenge is to find parental control,positive
"Wife loves it , uses it daily, works good , the only problem to her is when you charge it thier is no indictor light to say when it is fully charged.",positive
"I should preface this by saying I also own a nook (non color 3g) and an iPad 3gI order a LOT from amazon so when it came down to getting an e-reader it was a tough choice to pick B&N; over amazon.Why did I do this?I still LOVE the value of a retail store, living down the street from a B&N; i go there often to shop and pick up little gifts as well as browse books. There have been plenty of books that by their cover (yes i judge) and short summary I would've bought but because of my ability to skim the book in store I have decided not to buy.Similarly there are some great books out there but for photography and coffee table type books, you really can't experience them the same way with a nook or an ipad. All that being said, I decided to support B&N; because their library is just as large as amazons and I throughly enjoy their storefronts.Ok onto the review.Reading on the nook color is easy, the Android interface is fast and reliable, not to mention easy rootable!Reading on the nook vs the nook color is vastly different because of the eink display on the nook. There is a fair amount of eyestrain associated with reading on a backlit display but I had no problems reading for well over 2 hours on it. The font was just as clear and easy to read as on my ipad.Size wise it is not much different than the original nook but is much heavier.It is lighter and easier to carry than the ipad because of its dimensions.In the end I did not buy this product to read on it, I bought it to root and use android honeycomb on it.This makes the this the best value out of any reader on the market in my opinion.The nook has virtually the same specs as the Samsung galaxy tab aside from the 3g.at $250 (buy directly from B&N;) you cannot complain, Honeycomb runs smooth and opens up an entire world of possibilitiesfor this little tablet.",positive
"I originally had a Kindle and loved that one too.  The problem with the Kindle was the button you use to navigate.  I needed something more ergonomic and so I bought the Nook Color and send the Kindle back to Amazon (only had it for 2 1/2 weeks).  I just love it!  It's easy to navigate, turn the page, download and purchase books & free samples.  Just haven't found the magazines I'm looking for, so with that, I will go to the B & N store for assistance.  I also had to contact the company regarding a question on deleting samples.  They were courteous and were able to answer any and all my questions with patience.  I would recommend this product.  It is a little heavier than the Kindle, but so worth the extra money for the ease of use.",positive

"I don't usually jump on new technology or new products, but...  on seeing the vibrant color display of the Nook Color (NC), I took one home for a week.ebook Pros:Very quick to setup for ownership and downloading.Quick page turns and refresh rates.An accelerometer quickly permits reading in landscape or portrait mode.After resizing text you don't have to scroll down to see more text on the same 'page'  You just sweep your finger across the screen from R to L to see the next part of the page.The touch screen--sensitive & fast.You can lend books to other Nook owners for 2 weeks, and it really is a loan--you cannot access the book while offered or loaned.  (same as eInk Nook)You can borrow ebooks from libraries.  (same as eInk Nook)You can read a book for an hour each day at any B&N; store.  (same as eInk Nook)ebook Cons:short battery life, 6-10 hours?The touch screen. Don't touch it while reading or  1. a menu pops up for things like brightness settings, text size, highlighting, dictionary, share options, find button, content button & a slider to zip to a page quickly or;  2. the page might turn, or  3. the page will scroll vertically or horizontally.  You MUST hold the device by the margins outside the glass.  Great if you hold by the edges when you read a real book--all others, take notice, as my hands did tire of holding a book this way.You wish, after having seen how you upsize or downsize pages on the iPad (Pinch/spread 2 fingers on the glass) that you could do the same here.On the one I bought I saw some very irregular activity related to the menu flashing on and off without my having touched the screen & also the virtual keyboard would occasionally act up, e.g.,  a single key press of 'n' might give me 'nnn' or 'nmm' or even 'niin'The virtual keyboard requires you to press a '123' button to get numbers.web browser pros:great color and resolutionOn almost any monitor you'll have to scroll up/down to read long text passages.  The NC seemed to know how to center and wordwrap the text on most webpages in the display so as not require you to scroll left/right.Virtual keyboard has a "".com"" button for entering web addressesweb browser cons:It doesn't enlarge pages by the iPad/SamsungGalaxy pinch/spread technique.  You first must slide a finger on the screen to bring up a +/- buttons in a corner and then touch +.Same issue with my big long thumbs on the glass.  It'll scroll if I move my thumbs.I couldn't send an email until a BN tech directed me to the portable versions of [...] ([...]) ""m"" for mobile.Doesn't have 3GSame problem with the keyboard as above. When I took it in to B&N;, it played innocent and behaved well. Later, at home again it went nutty.Final verdict.  Not for me.  Perhaps a later version with better battery life, maybe color eInk, a version of the browser that supports Adobe Flash, a more behaved virtual keyboard with number keys above the letter keys. Possibly a carrying case that keeps my fingers off the screen while viewing.  Technology gets better and more affordable for late adopters.",positive
"I had the original Nook, had a friend's Kindle for a couple weeks, and now have the Nook Color. Although it's a bit weird to be writing a review of it on Amazon, I felt that potential Kindle purchasers should understand their options.The Nook Color is, by far, the best eReader I've used (including the iPad). It's not perfect, but it almost is. The LCD screen is very easy to read, which surprised me since I was a big fan of e-ink and did not like long-term reading on the iPad. The lack of need for a night light is great, and the software it ships with is lightning fast and almost bug-free. Really, there is no lag when I'm using it and the functionality (once you spend 3 minutes learning it) is near-perfect.BN is quickly catching up to Amazon on content...frankly don't notice a difference anymore. Plus, you can side-load eBooks from Google and elsewhere.I know this...I will never go back to e-ink again and love this screen.I also LOVE the delivery of magazines on this thing. Really, it's better than the real magazine. You get full color reproduction of text and pics, and it gives you an Article View if you just want to read the article. It is a great way to get magazines and will be better as they get more publishers (right now, it's a decent list but it could be better).I also really like the multimedia support...I can load photos and pics on an Micro SD card and take my music with me. If I'm in a wifi area, I get full Pandora support! I wish it had 3G, but this is still great.Having said that, the Color is not perfect. First off, the weight, while acceptable, is SLIGHTLY too much. It won't cause strain like the iPad and is perfectly capable of being read in bed (you can lock out the gyro so the book doesn't flip Portrait=>Landscape), but it's not the unnoticeable weight of the Nook or Kindle (or paperback). Still way better than a hardcover though.Second, the screen, while great, is slightly tactile, not glass like you would be used to on an iPhone or high-end Android phone...this is nitpicky, but I noticed it.Third, no Flash support yet (and, while it is a great web-browser, it's not a laptop, iPad, or even like my HTC Evo). This, and the lack of pinch-zoom multi-touch, affects my enjoyment of the web brower (note: you can zoom, just not pinch-zoom). UPDATE: Pinch Zoom is here! It's very good, but not great, implementation. Makes the browser that much better!Fourth, the newspaper delivery, while acceptable and similar to the original Nook/Kindle, is not good enough. Frankly, it's easier to read the web pages of the papers than on this and pales in comparison to the magazine delivery, which really is SUPERB!Finally, and most importantly, is the battery. This is not like an e0ink reader. To give you an idea, the other day, I started out with a full charge and I read around 600 pages of a book and did some light browsing. I did not use music or Pandora and did not pay any games. At the end of the day, I had to charge it again. This was about 7 or 8 hours of use. That's OK with me but it ain't the type of thing that you can go on a three day road trip without your chord like the Kindle or original Nook.Anyway, it looks like my cons are longer than the pros, but really, this is a great product. I can't wait to see Amazon's response and appreciate the (hopefully) friendly competition that this represents!",positive
"Had one since Christmas 2010 and already owned a regular Nook, so I am familiar with the differences between the displays.  The NC is a fabulous, if a bit heavy, device that is a great ebook reader as well as video player out of the box.  Root the thing and it becomes an android tablet, giving you access to a lot of functionality.I have no issues with reading on the NC.  Adjusting the brightness and contrast is easy enough and I've read for hours with no eye strain.  I'm more than satisfied with it because unlike the Kindle, I can read almost anything (and rooted even Kindle books using the android Kindle app).  Works with library lending, free ebook sites and the Calibre tool helps expand what you can read even more.Hands down, it's the best device out there at the price.",positive
"Bought mine a few days ago and returned. It is an ok device but does not truly shine as an ereader and I will expand on it shortly.1st, this is more a hybrid device than an ereader. An ereader basically is for reading documents in an electronic format. Examples of good ereaders: Kindle (of course), Nook 1st generation and Sony. Nook Color, besides allowing you to read, let you browse internet, listen music, play some games and much more tablet oriented stuff. Of course, there is nothing wrong on that until you start thinking about how important color and internet are for just reading a simple book.So, what's cool or nice:-Internet.Full color internet experience, with nice virtual keyboard and ok browser. Touching the screen and keyboard is like an iPad or similar tablets, but is comfortable enough for short emails or using Wikipedia or Google.-PDF supportWith Nook Color not only you can read PDFs in a nice full color screen but you can expand or zoom in at will, move along pages with a simple touch or even rotate and read in landspace mode. This feature is really amazing and the selling point if reading PDFs is your only or most important task.-Full color screenPretty obvious. If you like magazines or would like to get electronic subscriptions of any of them, look no further. The resolution, colors and screen is perfect, a real pleasure to read using a NC. Depending of the magazine you can also extract or read the text or article portion only, leaving images apart.BUT!... not everything is perfect ...-No landscape mode for booksYou have landscape mode while reading PDFs but not while reading regular ePub books. This was a real surprise to me, a bad one! Landscape mode allows you to rotate and read poetry or technical books without cutting the paragraph or breaking lines. With no Landscape mode you are forced to read every book ""as is"" and for a hybrid table which costs more than $200.00, in my opinion, it is not acceptable. My Kindle 3 rotates and it's 50% cheaper!-LCD screenI must admit this device has less glare issues than iPad or Galaxy, but if you have read using eink technology you would not go back and change to LCD again. Reading on a Nook Color for several hours is not easy for your eyes. And forget about using it at your pool or outdoors, unless is cloudy or you find the perfect angle; the glare will bother you while reading anyway. Indoor is a different story but it created some eye strain on me anyway, specially after long reading sessions.-HeavyFor serious readers (those who read novels, fiction books, technical books) or more than 2 or 3 weeks per month, please think again before buying. With about 18oz your hands and wrist will start complaining soon and if you don't have a desk or something to put your NC on, your choices are using your tummy, chest, lap or knee as additional support. A deal breaker. Being a Kindle 3 owner I know what I'm talking about. You can hold a Kindle 3 with one hand and read for hours with little or no problems at all.-BatteryOnly 8 hrs of continue use, average. I bought it a Tuesday, read for about 5 hrs that day, went to bed (leave it on but in sleeping mode). Next day morning turned it on, used it 1 more hour and soon after that the device was at 16% of battery life. (I barely used internet and brightness was at minimum) Another important point about battery and charge is that the Nook Color must be charged via wall, not USB or computer unless screen is off, which means you must forget about using the device during the charging process. The adapter is also proprietary so you can't use your Nook 1st gen adapter or the one some Androids use, I don't like that, I don't like proprietary stuff. The more standard, the more common, the better to replace or find.-No zoom or ability to enlarge imagesAn image with wrapping text around in that cool book? If you can't read it or maybe is too small, then sorry...you're out of luck. You have (at the moment of this review) no way to click, expand or enlarge that image. If you read mostly novels this means nothing to you. But if you read technical books with some images or illustrations on it, the size will be so small that is basically useless and not readable at all. I can't believe this simple feature is absent and I can only hope for a future fix via firmware-Android based but not full access to Android marketShame on you B&N.; This device could be a real hit if was not so closed or locked. As usual, this device will be hacked for those with brave hearts or basic computer skills (actually, it has been) but warranty will not be honored and it's a hassle to keep it up to date after official B&N; firmware upgrades, in case you hacked or rooted the device; also you won't be able to read books in-store if you root it. While B&N; keeps selling the unit without Android Market or a restricted version of it, this device will be like having a Magnum revolver in your hands without any bullets. So much power with Android/Linux but you just can't use it.-No ""read me"" featureFor a $200.00 tablet, I would expect this feature. The Kindle it's not so powerful in terms of hardware or processor and it reads the English books for you.SummaryIf you read a lot, portability and battery life are important for you, forget about Nook Color. If you are a casual reader, looking for a fun device and distractions (Internet, Games, etc) Nook color will fit your bill. Just keep in mind that Nook Color is not a true ereader though, but more like a tablet with reading abilities; if you are aware of that and eye strain is not a concern, this can be a great buy.For now, I will pass. My Kindle 3 is simpler and lighter and does very good what it suppose to do: let me read (or read for me) my favorite books. Most novels and technical books are not in color so I don't need a tablet with Internet access to enjoy them, why bother then?",positive
"Last year my husband asked me if I wanted a Kindle, because I love to read all the time and I try to be eco-friendly when possible.  I was intrigued, but my biggest weakness is magazines and I didn't like the availability or look of them on the Kindle.  When the iPad came out, I was blown away by the beauty of it, but felt like for a few dollars more I could just get a whole new laptop and it would be almost the same size.  For travel, the iPad seemed to big and fragile for me; I need to be able to jam all my toys into my backpack and not worry about them.When I stumbled onto the Nook Color, I absolutely flipped my wig and couldn't wait to get one!  Full color magazines, that look just like they do on the newsstand!  This could single-handedly save the rain forests - I seriously buy a LOT of magazines.  I also save them forever because you never know when you might want that one article or photo again, which drives my husband crazy.  So perhaps the Nook Color can save my marriage as well!  That's a lot of expectation to put on this adorable little device, but I think it's up to the challenge.Santa decided to come early to our house, so I just started playing with the NC a few days ago, and it is my first e-reader.  It was almost fully charged right out of the box, so I was able to start playing with it in less than an hour (it says you can use it while it is plugged in, but they keypad is VERY oversensitive when plugged in so I don't recommend it).  It easily connected to my home wifi and linked to the Barnes & Noble account I had set up earlier that day.  If you don't have home wifi, you might have to visit a public wifi location in order to activate it.  I recommend setting up a B&N; account beforehand if you intend to purchase anything from there, as it makes the first-time Nook use very smooth and enjoyable.BOOKS: There are many many books available from a variety of online sources, check the product details for formats (please note it does NOT support Kindle format).  I understand it's also easy to download books from your local public library, though I haven't tried that yet.  The B&N; Shop function within the Nook itself is the easiest interface but certainly not the only option.  While reading, it's very easy to adjust the font, screen brightness, and more to make it as comfortable as possible on the eyes.  At night I turn the brightness all the way down and find it very comfortable for my eyes while reading in bed.  I've read for hours on end without any sort of headache.  I haven't used the highlight, look-up, or share functions very much yet, but they're super easy to incorporate if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Page turning is an intuitive flip of the finger, or you can tap the side of the screen to move forward or back.CHILDREN'S BOOKS: The color on these looks amazing, and the ""read to me"" feature is wonderful for little ones learning to read on their own.  I imagine this would be great fun for a kid stuck in the back seat of a car for a long trip too!  There aren't a ton of Read to Me books available yet but they are adding more every week.  I don't even have kids but these are pretty awesome.MAGAZINES: Obviously this was a major feature for me!  The appearance of the magazines is absolutely gorgeous, the text and photos are clear and sharp.  You can use the ""finger pinch"" method on the touchscreen to zoom in and out, or you can use the ""Article View"" feature to pull out just the text of each page at a pleasant reading size.  The magazine includes every single page that you'd find on the newsstand, including advertisements, which to me is a benefit because I sometimes enjoy the photography and trends those provide.  Magazines can be read in portrait or landscape format, and you can flip through thumbnails at the bottom of the page to reach a particular article.  Most of the currently available magazines offer a single-issue purchase or a 14-day free trial, then bill you monthly for as long as you want to receive issues.  Subscriptions are very easy to manage so canceling is not complicated.  So far there are about 80 magazines available, and the number seems to be increasing regularly.NEWSPAPERS and PDF's: I haven't tried these yet, though some have reported formatting that make certain ones difficult to read.  The ones purchased directly through the Nook store are more likely to be formatted appropriately for the device and easier to read.  Better PDF support is likely to come in a future firmware update, though a lot of it depends on how the original publisher sets up the file.INTERNET: You do need a wifi connection to go online; 3G is unlikely to be available for the Nook Color unless you also purchase an accompanying data plan.  So far most web pages look crisp and beautiful, but are not as fully functional as on a laptop or computer.  Flash functionality is not available yet (but is planned) and a lot of people are experiencing difficulty with email and other text box typing.  I believe this will be fixed very soon, but for now the web is more of a ""read-only"" experience.MUSIC: You can load your own music or use the included Pandora app to link to your Pandora account.  The speaker isn't great so headphones would come in handy.  I'm extremely in love with my new iPod Nano so I will probably strap that on while reading rather than use this feature.VIDEO: Our first try produced some choppy playback, but I think the processor was very busy setting up the hardware because we had just gotten it out of the box.  After that, it played everything perfectly with jaw-dropping video quality!  It will play videos in MP4 format, so get yourself a converter and a microSD card and load it up for your next trip!  Apparently videos can also be side-loaded through the mini-USB cord.  I've only tried it on the card; it reads directly from the card with no problems.OTHER: You can add your own photos to use as background, or just to show friends.  It comes pre-loaded with a few games (sudoku, crossword, and chess) which work well and are fun.  ""Lend Me"" is an exclusive feature that allows you to swap books with other Nook users, and you can find groups of folks online who will swap with you if none of your friends have a Nook.  It uses the android operating system, and an app store is scheduled to open sometime in early 2011 so there will be much much more available in the coming months.I'm the type of person who doesn't need my phone to be a camera, my iPod to be a dvd player, or my e-reader to be a laptop.  The Nook Color does a WONDERFUL job as an e-reader of not only books, but also magazines and newspapers, and it has some other fun bells and whistles.  It does what it's supposed to do very well and the additional features make it a great value for the price.  I would give it a million stars if I could!",positive
"I agree with the other positive reviews. The color nook is an excellent reading machine, much better than either the Kindle or the e-ink B&W nook. Using the color Nook is totally intuitive with only a few positive surprises at some unexpected capabilities. The battery life is around 8 hours, so you will need to have your special recharging cord, which comecolor s with the Nook, handy. There are small imperfections in the Nook operating system that will get corrected as Barnes and Noble releases updates. The same was true with the Kindle and B&W Nook when first released. The key to a good reading experience with the color Nook is to turn the brightness down, way down. That way eye fatigue is minimal, similar to the e-ink B&W readers with similar brightness. Even with the brightness down, the contrast is excellent and the letters clear. When browsing the web, you might want to turn the brightness up a bit to beautifully display all those colors. The web browser is excellent. It works for email, especially Google mail.  The trick with the power limitations is to keep the brightness down when using the Nook as a reader and turn the internet off. Only turn the internet on when browsing or shopping. That way, when you put it down at night, the power level will be the same in the morning as it was when you went to sleep. Costing only $249 (Dec 2010) at Barnes and Noble, it's affordable and useful, especially if you travel.  The minus 1 star is for the few little glitches in the 1.0 operating system (based on Android 2.2), for the 8 hour battery life, and for the current lack of Apps. For what it is supposed to do, it does it well; it's better than an i-Pad (smaller, lighter, and far less costly). Upgrades and Apps will follow, making an excellent device even better.",positive
"Bought this for my wife to replace her aging Sony reader. She really enjoyed it as a backlit reader and web browser for many months. Then I decided to root it and turn it into a full Android tablet. Now it's sooo much more than what she ever thought she needed and something she can't live without. Performance isn't bad on anything we've installed. Rooting takes some tech skills, but isn't too bad. I would highly recommend the tablet even if you don't root it.",positive
"I should preface this review by stating that I'm predisposed to liking tech gadgets that are a bit geeky, but do appreciate good industrial and UI design.The NC is really a great color eReader that also happens to have the makings of a terrific, Android based tablet.  BN literally buries the Android OS under a very thick custom UI and turns off many Android features.  This thick customized layer is what make the NC a great eReader, but a not so great a tablet. So while it is locked down, it does what its meant to do very well.One CAN get to non-BN eBooks in either the ePub or Adobe PDF format. Either format works, looks, and reads very well, easily as good as the best the market has to offer in terms of an eBook reading app.  The fact that BN chooses to bury the location of the downloaded non-BN content AND prevents one from creating shortcuts to either the book file or folder, placing said free books on the book shelf, or even listing them in your list of books is an annoyance to the tolerant and tech savvy.  To non-techies and those less tolerant of mucking about with a gadget, e.g., Grandma, it'd be a showstopper.  But then again, would such a user even KNOW how to get to free eBooks?Movies, again well-hidden in the file system, look great, but BN has capped the max resolution below the abilities of the screen AND the stock player is finicky about format.  For instance, my ripped for iPod Touch movies play fine.  My ripped for Droid Incredible movies aren't playable.  This despite both are MV4 files with AAC soundtracks.  The latter are higher resolution and bit rate so that's the issue.  Again, annoying, but not a real problem.The web browser is just fine.  Pretty much a stock Android browser so fast enough, compatible enough messing around, but if I were going to really do some research, I'd use my computer.With Android 2.2 coming in January, and a BN 'approved' Android market, it'll be an amazingly capable tablet for the money.And that is what one has to remember, it's an exceptional value given the hardware (fast processor/GPU combination, GREAT IPS LCD screen with better color/resolution then an iPad), 512MB RAM, expandable storage, great build quality), and has the best eReader app bar none.  Once Android 2.2 is added with some access to at least a few other apps like email, better browser, and a more format flexible music/video player the value will be simply unassailable...at the price.Pros:Great screen - overall looks, color quality, text quality, adjustabilityeReader UIMagazine format is excellentNewspaper and magazine subscriptions are month to monthBuild qualityIndustrial design - it actually sit flat on a table unlike the iWobleMicroSD supportForm factor - fits MANY of the now discontinued or about to be discontinued Amazon Kindle 2 cases!Battery life (for such a lightweight LCD based device in its size range)Full Android experience just a hack awayUnderlying processor/GPU/RAM is quite powerful though not tops, but more then capable of moving to Android 2.2 and possibly even GingerbreadCan read library eBooks if your local library carries themCons:THICK BN UI if you really want the tablet partsUI takes a few minutes to learnBluetooth not enabled (though it may be Bluetooth ready)No microphone (and therefore no Skype down the road unless the headphone jack can be used like early generation iPod Touches)Will need to hack if the BN Nook Market does not have what you want in terms of appsBN prices their books too highBN magazine subscriptions can be high, though some are a good valueNo camerasRecommended to the magazine/newspaper reader especially.  Best of the LCD eReaders, period. Great value in an Android Tablet.",positive
"First off, for those of you buying this product expecting the e-ink experience, you are wrong.  This isn't an e-ink screen, if that is what you are looking for, go with (a) the original nook, (b) the kindle, or (c) any of the other e-ink dedicated e-readers on the market.This iteration of the nook is marketed towards certain select categories of readers:-The Magazine reader-Students with text books that have graphics-Childrens' books with lots of pictures-Comic book readersIf you notice, these are categories of readers that benefit from the ability of the reader to handle color graphics, which is something e-ink can't yet do!PRICEFor the price, you are getting an android tablet with limited functionality, though, with some technical knowledge, it is possible to unlock this device to be able to fully take advantage of the android market (though it may void your warranty, so do it at your own risk).  Similarly sized android tablets go for prices starting at double the price of the nook color, but they come with full functionality.  Another device this has been compared to is the iPad- which runs at about twice the price as well for the very base model.  On the price point, you are definitely getting a decent deal, though, you are sacrificing some of the functionality for the the reduced cost.Also note, you are not getting 3G access or any other cellular service to access the market- unlike the original nook, that came with the free mobile access to be able to make purchases from the nook market on the go.  The likely reason for the lack of mobile access is due to the fact that this device runs a lot faster and features a full web browser- this increases the speed and easy of the user to access web content- which would be undesirable to any phone service that hosts access because it would reduce the service that their paying customers get.  Instead of mobile data service, users have the option of accessing the BN market and the full internet through wireless.  With today's cell phone technology, many phones are able to be set up as wireless hotspots that users can use to get access on the go- when they are away from their home network.  Overall, this isn't a big deal to me, but I am sure some original nook users depend on that free mobile service to get access to the BN market, so this would be a draw back for you for sure.WEIGHTHonestly, this device does run a little on the heavy side, however, I do believe that it is slightly lighter than it's predecessor.  Still, for the e-reader market, it is heavy.  For the tablet market, it is a little more reasonable.  The weight is a sacrifice, but as long as you aren't trying to read while laying on your back, you should be ok.USER FRIENDLINESS AND EXTRA FEATURESI find this device to be quite simple almost immediately.  Every function that I have looked for has been where I expect it to be and everything has worked smoothly for me.  The page controls while you read work great, and I love that they now give you the option to tap to turn the page rather than having to swipe like you did with the last version of the nook.The full web is pretty easy to use once you get used to typing on a touch screen keyboard (which is always annoying).This device also integrates with your facebook, twitter, and google accounts.  This is great for the avid readers that want to be plugged into their social media.Another feature that is nice to have on the reader is Pandora- it is a nice added bonus to have internet radio available on the reader.One thing I wish this device had was access to android market, but I guess you can't have everything.OVERALLI like this tablet.  I think it was a good buy and I would buy another one if this one broke.  For the price, you are getting an underpowered tablet, but it still has access to the full internet- which you can use multiple windows in.  It is primarily a reader, which makes me wish it were as easy on the eyes as e-ink, but for the market it is being geared towards, you can't really complain about that!",positive
"It came early which is nice, it didnt come with a box which was already described in the details. but It was nice, came as described and worked fine.",positive
"I didnt buy my Nook Color to read. I bought it because I wasn't thrilled at paying $500 for an iPad. As long as you have a micro SD card and can follow a few simple instructions, you can turn this into a fully-functional Android tablet. Best of all, you can run Android entirely from the SD card (I recommend 16 or 32gb) and if you need to put this back into ""Nook mode"" (for instance, for warranty repair), simply remove the SD card and it will be as if you never did anything out of the ordinary. With the CPU overclocked to 1.1 ghz, I can play Angry Birds, listen to music, and download a file all at the same time, and that's the heaviest usage scenario I can really envision for one of these.",positive
"Well, for the price, it's easily the best Android tablet out there if you don't care about not having 3G, GPS, and camera. Took less than 5 minutes to root it once I did all the reading on nookdevsdotcom wiki. Installed Launcher Pro, Google Maps, few widgets, Angry Birds, and Opera browser.The device has great style and build quality and battery seems to last pretty good in my 10 hours of play time with it. Screen is gorgeous. I think if they skipped hard metal and went for carbon metal or good plastic it probably would have shed few ounces in weight and would have felt lighter to hold for long time. That is no deal breaker though as the 7"" size is perfect to hold for long time unlike other tablets that are way too big to hold with single hand for reading.Tried couple of kids books for my daughter and the color screen makes the content look rich and attractive. Will soon be trying out periodicals and photography books. But my main intention of owning it is for tablet and I would recommend it. I read instructions on how to make NookColor connect to Adhoc WiFi Hotspot. Once I get that working, I can Tether the NookColor with my rooted Xperia X10 to browse while I have no WiFi networks around.I wish I have some cons to mention but that would be silly at it's price point. It's a real steal at it's $249 price.",positive
"High Points:-Very Responsive Touch Screen-Touch screen is easy on the eyes even though it's back lit-Page Turning (very fast, instant, and seamless - no flashing or delay - my favorite feature)-Very organized menu-Decent sound quality-Physical home screen button (very useful)-Free eBook Fridays curtesy of Barnes & Noble-eLend technology from your local library (if they offer this service, mine does, it's a very nice feature to have, only reason why I chose a Nook over a Kindle)-The kids books are fun to read on this-The internet browsing experience is quite nice. Web pages load quickly-The interface and device are both very beautiful-Great accessories available for item-Great Size - fits easily in my hand-Back Lit display is very very nice to have - no need for a flashlight - can read in the dark)-Very easy to book mark pages-Playing games on this are a lot more fun than playing games on the original Nook (thanks to the touchscreen)-Barnes & Noble eBook store is quite nice and easy to browse-The on-screen keyboard is also niceLower Points:-BATTERY LIFE (if I used the internet at all, I'm lucky if it lasts through the day on a full charge - with the internet off, it still only last about 3 days if you use it everyday - the standby battery life (with the device in sleep mode-not off) is pretty good though.-No physical page turning button - sometimes I advance or flip backwards by accident-Weight (not a deal breaker, you get used to it, but it could be a lot lighter)Conclusion:I love love Love my NookColor. I take it with me everywhere I go. There's no 3g option that I'm aware of, but I only browse the internet with I'm at home anyway. The battery doesn't last long enough for you be connected to the internet too often anyway. There is no cool page turning animation like on an ipad, it just changes instantly to the next page, which is still a great feature on this item. It's not so great as a tablet though. The internet browser is great, but there is no flash support (not for the ipad either though) and there are few apps. That is not important to me as I'm using this as an eReader and occasionally play the included games on it when I'm bored (sodoku, crossword, chess). I like that you can play music and listen to it in the background. When connected to the internet, the Pandora Radio app is nice to have in the background, though I've found it rather difficult to turn off when I'm done with it.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an eReader and doesn't care if they have to charge it back up every few days.",positive
"Technology changes and grows with each passing second, so sometime in the future, something else will eventually dethrone the NookColor (just 'tis the way of things...I was a Blackberry fangirl, and converted to Android when it finally stepped up to the plate...but Blackberry was 'the best' for me until Droid).Anyway...with that said as justification for my 'current' qualifier in the title....for me in the current available items on the market, it's NookColor all they way, baybee.The screen is fantastic, both indoors and out, and it's readability is profound.  I don't like it's failure to be as responsive whilst plugged in and charging, but when not plugged in, I've yet to have a problem with it.I love how it's divided into different options, and that it supports PDF as well as the ePUB format.  There are books galore out there in this manner.  I also love that I can share this particular unit with my 7 year old daughter who is just starting chapter books, but still has a love for picture books.  We have several Tomie DePaola books on there already for her!As an Android fan, I'd of course love to see it connect to the Android Market...but I didn't buy this to be a bigger version of my Android. I bought it to be an eReader.  With the add'l memory space avaialble, and the fact that the battery CAN be replaced, just those two features alone for me raise the Nook or NookColor head and shoulders above the Kindle.That said...while I had a slight preference for the Nook itself over the Kindle, I'm even more thrilled I waited until the NookColor came out.  I'm looking forward to a long future snuggled up with my new best friend. ;)",positive
"I got a Nook Color for my anniversary, and returned it within the 2-week trial period.  It worked fine; it just was rather pointless.  I have a Kindle, but I wanted something more functional that I could read in the dark (I LOVE my Kindle - the Nook was in addition to, not as a replacement).  To make the Nook into a true tablet, you have to hack it.  We did that, and it was ok, but still not able to access the entire Android market and some apps just didn't work right.  I did a factory reset and returned it, then ordered an actual Android tablet (which I have not yet received, so I can't compare them yet).  There wasn't anything wrong with the Nook, really.  It was just a lot of money for what is basically a glorified e-reader.",positive
"I got mine from B&N; and I'm very happy with it! My color ebooks look so great on it. The only problem I have is with playing youtube videos. I'm using the link B&N; put on my bookmarks.Other than that though, its awesome. It works really well & haven't had any trouble with any ebooks....however some image scanned pdf books need to be flicked up/down instead of sideways like regular books.UPDATE:After playing with it a little longer, I got things going better. My youtube videos all work fine and I love it even more now.I have actually purchased a few different ereaders before this since I was trying to find one I liked (such as Sony Touch, kindle and a few others which are all newest models) and my NookColor is my absolute favorite!A few problems that I hope may be fixed with future updates is when I visit certain pages (ex: google.com) & tap a text box to type something in, my keyboard will dissappear & I have to tap text box a few times to get it to reappear.The other thing is my sound seems very low when turned up all the way.In any case, I still LOVE it. The color is AMAZING & I can use this for hours! No eye strain trouble here & it is able to read EVERY ebook I load onto it. I haven't had to buy any B&N; books yet because I already owned so many",positive
"REVIEW....Part 2:Loved my Nook Color before the new software updates and app additions...but now!!  WOW!! I own a Motorola Xoom Tablet and have only had it for about a month.  If these updates had come a month earlier I may never have purchased the Xoom, but with that said, and now that I have both, their are differences that I'm glad to own both.Nook Color for the value:emailgamesadobe flash (you tube and much more)musicreading (books and magazines with brilliant color) prefer the Nook for reading bookssurfing the internetsize (easy to hold)and for women it fits in my handbagVersus...Motorola Xoom:emailgamesadobe flash (you tube and much more)sharper picture when viewing movies/videosmusicreading (from kindle and nook downloads to the Xoom with their apps)surfing the internetsize (being larger for a better viewing experience) it won't fit in my handbag (but that's mine)quality is amazingmuch more....There are many many things similar to the Nook versus Xoom or Ipad but the value of the Nook Color over the others isthe best and for your average user who just wants to surf the net, view videos, read your email, listen to music andplay (at the moment limited games) and to read books (size for holding to read is perfect) the Nook Color is the BEST valueand it won't disappoint.1st review:Received my NookColor for Christmas and waited until now to write my review.  I wanted to make sure what I write will help others.  Take this device for what it is....a e-reader and not a tablet.  I love it for reading ebooks and emagazines.  A perfect size for books and just a little too small for magazines but if you have patience you can make any page larger just by pinching your fingers open.The color of photos are amazing and beautiful.  I can view just about any website, but not videos from flash.  Again this is not a tablet. But I can view many Youtube videos.  I have downloaded my own photos and they look great.I cannot open my emails from my carrier (comcast), not sure why. The website...but not the individual emails from my contacts.The touchscreen is pretty sensitive and sometimes I end up having to do things twice.I gave my review four stars only...because of my email restrictions and the sensitivity of the touchscreen.Overall I do love the size and the many things you can do with the NookColor.FYI...I typed this review on my NookColor...",positive
I bought this item for my wife for Christmas. I didn't know what to expect since this wasn't what she actually wanted. But I knew what she needed as she is a book worm and has magazines n books strayed everywhere. She also has no intent on getting rid of them no time soon. Needless to say it had to grow on her (she wasn't too thrilled at first). Now that thing is everywhere and I don't haveto live with magazines everywhere taking up space.  Afterward I bought an hd+. We've been more than happy with our decision.,positive
"The ColorNook was a great device when they first put it out at the end of 2010. However, it is incredible with the new upgraded software that came out at the end of April 2011. You can do email, there are apps, videos are super!!! And there is flash. I also like the fact that I can adjust the brightness of the screen to prevent eyestrain.You can have multiple email addresses on the email account, which is great for me as I have 3 separate email addresses. In an effort to protect my computer from emailed viruses, I am opening my email on my Nook. That way if a virus sneaks in, it takes out a less expensive device than my computer.I also like the idea of being able to subscribe to magazines that are photo intensive and I can actually see the pictures in color.That said, I still like my Kindle ereaders very much for reading books.",positive
"The Nook Color is OK as an e-book reader and the apps Barnes and Noble offer are OK, but I installed a 16gb SD card with the Android OS and this thing is smokin.  I can watch Netflix, listen to local radio stations and you can get any of the apps in the world, not the just few Barnes and Noble offer.",positive
"I bought the Nook color after using the original Nook wifi to read a few books.  I'm sure like many people I was drawn to the ""color"" of the screen.  It is crystal clear, it's great for books with drawings or art in them.  Really brings it to life.  This is about all I've really liked.What I don't like is its heavy.  Compared to the original Nook and the Kindle it's a heavy monster.  The screen glares with everything.  I hate seeing myself in the screen when I'm trying to read.  The touchablilty of the screen is 100 times better than the b/w Nook.  It doesn't turn when you turn the Nook itself, even though you have the screen adjustment feature turned on.  Did I mention it was heavy?  Also I took it outside and yes I adjusted the brightness all the way up.  However, I could not read the screen with my sunglasses on even at its brightest setting.  It's like my Iphone, can't see the screen in sunlight.  This is the part that frustrated me the most.  Also the lighted background of the reading screen seemed to make my eyes excessively tired after long periods of reading.  The battery life is pretty short too.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this ereader.  Get the Kindle, you'll be much happier and it's cheaper.  Also Kindle books don't charge tax to buy them like Nookbooks.",positive
"I bought a refurbished Nook Color a few months ago as well as a dual-boot android Micro-SD card (from eBay).  This is by far the best value tablet I've found anywhere!  NC is well made, arrived in like-new condition, reliable, responsive and by booting to full Android (with the dual-boot micro-SD) it is a real tablet with full access to the Android market. Only cons are lack of microphone or camera, but for a total cost of &lt;$180 it's awesome!  Good battery life, beautiful screen, responsive and a really excellent reader (especially in low light - but the screen can be made very bright for daytime use).  I also have a Kindle keyboard which I love for daytime reading but the NC works in the evenings in a darkened room and does all the other things a tablet can do.  Just NC on a holiday trip and left my laptop behind!  NC was perfect for email, RSS, games and reading, including pdf books and Netflix movies.  If you have an Android phone, using this is the same with a much better screen.  It's a really good tablet as is, but with the dual-boot MSD card it is an awesome deal!",positive
"I went into the tablet market for two reasons: (1) I read mostly inside in the evenings and was tired of needing a book light for the e-ink reader and (2) I wanted to consolidate my travel electronics from phone + ereader + notebook.  The prices of straight tablets were outrageous to me when my primary purpose was to eliminate taking the laptop along to be able to review email and do moderate web browsing on a decent sized screen (the phone was way too small).  After reading several reviews and recommendations, I settled on a used Nook Color for both price and performance.  I have not been disappointed.  I have rooted my device for a full blown Android experience and a far superior web browser but rooting is not needed for the basics. I'm just someone who likes to tinker.Everyone needs to understand, this is an e-reader first and a tablet second even when rooted.  At $200, you cannot expect what you would get with a $500-$600 device.  But, it does what it is intended to do quite well.  At 7 inches the screen is comparable size to most e-readers and that was important to me for portability.  I simply swapped the e-ink reader for the Nook Color and it still fit perfectly in my purse.  The Nook Color is also really good for reviewing emails and smooth web browsing.  My rooted device has an overclocked processor so I have no problems with speed.  It's perfect for quickly reaching out to the web to check the latest news, weather, etc. and then get right back to reading my books.  I haven't had many problems running other Android tablet applications and have found that the problems I have had seem to be common problems with the applications themselves.If you want a premium e-reader, this is a super nice product at a great price.  If you're looking for a budget tablet without all of the bells and whistles (camera, gps, microphone) but that will handle the basics of email, web browsing, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and other consumption tasks, this is more than adequate and enjoys much more favorable reviews than similarly priced tablets (with the exceptions of the Kindle Fire and its own successor the Nook Tablet).  The bottom line with this little marvel is to keep your expectations in line with what you're paying for and what you're not paying for. If you expect a $200 version of the standard bearer (i.e IPad), then you'll be very happy.  If, however, you're expecting a $200 equivalent, then look elsewhere.",positive
"I have a Amazon Kindle E-reader and few hundred books and was wondering ifthe ""Nook"" works on the same book format (mobi) as the kindle.  I Emailed a friend last night and he wrote back this morning  saying his Nook was dead in the water (it can happen with any of them)  What was funny was he said he wrote a review on the Nook  and said that he purchased a Color Nook and have enjoyed it for many years. Then one day it stopped working so he called customer service and was transferred to some foreign country where the woman could not speak English well,  so he asked to speak to another. Next a man came on who spoke worse that the woman so he asked if there was another person. When talking to the next person he was rude so he  asked customer service if he  could sent it in for repair.  The Nook Rep.  had gotten mad and said sure sent it back to North Korea and hung up the phone.  He said he  sent a number of Emails and they didn't  respond or when they did they say read the manual.  So John the Nook is great until you need service but to answer your question I can't open mine  to see the format so you may have to go by a Barnes and Nobel and ask them. You may need to hurry as Barnes and Nobel books stores may be closing the doors soon. Most everyone is switiching over to the E-readers.",positive
"I was looking for a e-reader for our 13 year old's birthday this past October.  After researching the popular e-readers i.e. the Kindle Fire, I went with the Nook Color for one simple reason; the ability to Root it and turn it into an Android tablet, for a lot less! (It also takes a macroSD card). While you can find the Kindle rooted too, I found the Nook Color rooted was more readily available and more affordable. Since I was purchasing for a teen I  did not want to get a new or more expensive model.We purchased one that was already rooted to cyanogenmod 7.  You can also purchase an macro SD card here or on Ebay that is rooted for you if you already own a Nook Color.We connected it to our home wi-fi and Viola, she can do everything i.e. text free, download games and unlimited apps from the Market. The rooted Nook Color can do everything a tablet can do except for make or receive phone/video calls.Note, all rooted Nook Colors are not the same version.  We purchased one for our son for this Christmas and I did not notice it was not cyanogenmod 7.  This is relevant as it did not possess full access to all of the apps on the Google Play (or Android market) as our daughter's does.  You can update the Root software and I did that but I did not notice a change in its ability to download the other apps. But honestly, I was tired at that point and gave it to our son on Christmas as it was good otherwise and I doubt he would notice. LolThis model is perfect for my teens, but I am thinking about the Kindle Fire HD for myself because it has a good camera and I love photography.P.S. I also purchased a silicone case in yellow and it brightens up the dark tablet a lot.  (I purchased both Nook Color e-readers used for $66 and $87 each on Ebay.)",positive

"I don't know why people make fun of these I just happen to love mine. It's very versatile, easy to use, you can add more space, and it's not too big. And it seems like they are getting huge now. I get hours of enjoyment out of it from reading, doing puzzles, playing games and listening to music. And mine is used!",positive
"I'm sure a lot of other potential E-Book wanna-be owners are wondering which one to buy. I was ready to order a Kindle, sight unseen, because anything that sells that well with so many rave reviews has to be good. Then I went to a local ""big Box"" store that carries the Kindle and the NookColor and seeing the fantastic color screen of the Nook sold me on that one.  Nothing against the Kindle but the NookColor brings childrens books (I have a 4yo granddaughter) and magazines to life.The Nook has a few quirks but none are deal breakers.  If you can, take one for a test drive.",positive
"I bought the Nook Color for its intended role as an ebook reader. I have a Kindle DX but it has trouble with many of the tabletop RPG PDFs I throw at it and the 4GB is a tad small to hold my 14GB collection. The built-in PDF reader is worthless, slow to open files the Kindle DX had no trouble with and wouldn't even turn pages. I jail broke it, install a mostly vanilla image of Froyo and installed Adobe Acrobat and from there it shined. Page turning and navigation was a breeze and it complimented (read not-replaced) the Kindle DX quite well.It's a tad small for anything more in-depth than book reading and Angry Birds. Even casual web browsing can be a pain and it's place as a bastard hybrid of a phone OS on a 7"" tablet form factor means it has the worst of both worlds. Maybe once (if?) Android tablets take off we'll see mobile pages more suited to them. The huge up side is that it fits perfectly in a large coat pocket and looks sleek enough to make you look cool removing it from the pocket of an aviator jacket.In the end it spends most of its time sitting on a shelf collecting dust. It'll probably end up a gift for someone who doesn't mind lower-end electronics. These days while the Kindle Fire looks good I'm waiting on the market to mature and Windows 8 tablets to ship before I go looking again.",positive
"A syndicated consumer advocate has a saying: ""I am willing to pay less for less.""  So am I.  I actually bought the Nook Color (NC) more for its tablet features than its e-book features.  I considered several tablets for at least double the price, but when the new Android OS was released for the NC, I decided to try it out.  I personally have not been disappointed.Here is what it doesn't have: camera, USB accessory support, fast processor, robust app forum, 3G model, and long battery life.  But as I said I am willing to pay less for less.  I primarily wanted it for basic web browsing (with Flash capability), movie playback, e-mail capability, and e-book capability.My experience has been great so far - I have had my NC for about six weeks.  I personally have had no problem with the web browser and it has met all of my needs.  Movie viewing has been fine and I have had no problems viewing them.  I use Handbrake to convert movies/videos to a format for the NC, and it works great.  I have several e-mail accounts I use for personal and business purposes, and the POP3 support the NC offers is perfect.  I am no longer tied to my PC, laptop, or confined to the small screen of a mobile phone.  As for the e-book reader, it's great as should be expected (My 8 year old daughter actually uses it for reading more than me.  I download books from the library for her, and she loves it.)  The notation, highlighting, and other reading tools are fine and it also has several options to customize the font and background color as well as the font size.Other reviewers have commented about crashes, but I have not had a single crash yet.  And I also don't think the stock Android OS is bad at all, but with this being my first experience with a tablet and Android OS, my expectations may have been lower than normal.  I am also hoping that the app market will improve over time.  I know I could root the OS, but for the time being I will just stick with what it came with.  To sum it up, I got what I paid for and am very happy (so far) with my NC",positive
"Purchased the Nook Color over a month ago.  I have been reading alot more since I got it , as it's so convenient to take everywhere.  I have not had any issues reading in the car on sunny days.  I also like the ability to read at night in my bed without any lights on, thus minimizing chances of waking up the wife.  The screen is very sharp and easy to read.  Magazines look awesome on the Nook Color and it's so much more convenient than having a stack of magazines clutter up the house.  I do not think it would be easy to read on the beach under direct sunlight, but it will be fine if you are under an umbrella (which is what I do when at the beach, as I'm cancer phobic). Wi-fi connection is automatic , seamless.  The web browser is better than I expected - and I use it often to read online newspapers and check email (way better than the Kindle's browser).There is to be a sofware upgrade in the next month or so which will enhance the NC even more.  Or you can root it yourself to turn it into a full blown tablet (at half the price of the Galaxy tablet!)The only drawback is the weight of the NC - it weights about the same as a hard cover book (though easier to hold than a hard cover book).",positive
The on-off button is located so that you will frequently turn off tbe machine by accident. The power button should be recessed. Same for volumn control.,positive
exactly what my daughter wanted.  she is more than tickled with this reader.  She will use it for hours and hours,positive
"i bought this with my brother for Father's Day. I tried to help him use the product thinking that i'm a reasonably educated person.The main problem that we had was trying to read Google ebooks in pdf format. I tried different methods. Downloading directly didn't work. And they will tell you this too as their help desk told me. And downloading it from a pc and transferring it.Even after going to a Nook kiosk, they were unable to figure it out and they even called tech support. Apparently they just don't work.This whole process of trying to get pdf ebooks to work was soo frustrating.Other huge negatives. Not very responsive and poor battery life for something that doesn't doo much for you and isn't that simple to use.My advice. Get a refurbished iPad. You'll be happier for the small price premium over a nook color. It does so much more and is worth the price.",positive
"I was instantly the hero for my wife this Christmas, when I surprised her with a nook color under the tree. The device has great aesthetics, with a 7 inch IPS LCD display that is one of the most pleasing I've ever laid my eyes on, a thin and sleek profile, wonderful packaging, and nice support from Barnes and Noble, but that as Paul Harvey would say is only the beginning, this review is about the rest of the story.  At first glance this appears like just another eReader, but with a color screen for magazines and children's books swapped in for the normal eInk, but there is something different lurking beneath.  This device runs android 2.1 under the hood, heavily modified as it may be out of the box, and with that choice of operating system comes a potential access a world of hackery that is well beyond the reach of any other eReader.  In order to access this world you need to be willing to educate yourself a bit and root this device.  The process is actually quite simple (go to XDA-Developers forums or nookdevs.com Nook Color portal to read about it), and despite the dire warning disclaimers quite foolproof, and fully reversible (just in case you need warranty service).Once rooted, the device gains access to android market, where you can get thousands of apps, games, and tools for free (legally), or for a small purchase price.  Compared to the currently empty nook app store, the android market is bursting with exciting activity.  A rooted nook color gets access to the kindle app, so you can basically read all your amazon purchases on this device too.  Sony Reader app is coming soon from what I've heard, so you are probably going to get support for that store too.  Tied to the Kobo ecosystem, to borrow a phrase, there is an app for that.  Emulators for old game consoles are working nicely.  Playing Angry Birds on a 7 inch tablet is so much more fun than on a tiny 4 inch phone.  Stock browser lacks pinch to zoom, download Dolphin HD, and there you go.  Can't put app shortcuts and widgets on the home screen, home switcher and one of the freeware launchers (ADW is pretty nice) got your back.  A rooted nook color becomes something of a worthy competitor to the much more expensive iPad and Galaxy Tab.  Unlike real android phones and tablets, this does lack the physical menu, back, and search buttons, but a software softkey is installed upon rooting, so there are functional on-screen virtual equivalents to do the job.Don't get me wrong, there are some things that won't work, as nook color lacks a 3G radio, camera, or GPS.  The ROM is also a heavily modified version, so some abilities have been stripped out, and won't be available until a true custom ROM is available.  But more apps a likely to work than not due to a capable processor, ample storage packed underneath, and most importantly a talented and dedicated hacking community willing to experiment with their device and then educate others.  This is still early in the development life cycle of the nook color, so their are some rough edges to the process, some things will require resorting to the command line to fix.  Considering what you get for the money, this is probably the best handheld portable device on the market today.  An instant game changer without a doubt.",positive
"I finally was convinced that I could enjoy an eBook reader, did my research, and settled on the Nook Color.  My goal was to be able to carry a few books around for pleasure, maybe even some business documents.  Even though I have an iPhone, I thought I would diversify and go after an Android based platform.  I figured that even if I decided to go with the iPad eventually I could use the Nook app on the iPad to read the books that I've bought.After a few weeks of using it, I'm close to handing it over to the kids or jailbreaking it for experimentation with Android, and getting an iPad.1) The quality is low.  The software is buggy, ironically one of the buggiest parts is trying to buy a book, where it more often than not hangs after a purchase with the download in limbo.  The battery charge socket seems to be flakey, so that often the unit gets confused about whether it is charging or now.2) Can't buy books when you're outside the US.  So, on an international business trip - when it'd be nice to pick up a few books for the plane or to pass time in a cafe - one can't buy a book.  That sucks.3) Although in theory I could load a bunch of PDF documents onto it for reading, the display is too small for them.  The interface for PDF documents, in terms of adjusting fonts, scrolling, is very limited.  Device is useless for this.4) The book selection is slim.  I don't think my tastes are that obscure, but I'm not interested in the mass market.  Forget pulling out old sci fi classics.  Forget getting a textbook.  And I find that some of the books that I would like to read are available for the Kindle but not the Nook.5) The iPhone Nook app is super buggy.  In theory it should let me sync, get my books on the iPhone too.  But the iPhone app just hangs and doesn't sync to my account, even after a reinstall.  If you read the reviews of the Nook app on the app store, they're all saying this.6) The App selection is slim.  Email doesn't work with outlook and there's no VPN support.Better to just get an iPad, clearly.",positive
I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my Nook Color. One of the main reasons I'm so happy with it is because I purchased the micro SD card that turns your Nook from an e-reader into an Android tablet. It works perfectly! Now I can enjoy the Nook ebooks but also have access to all the Android apps and features.,positive
"I purchased my nook color in june of 2012. i had been online looking at various e-readers and comparing the features. i finally decided on the Nook color.**pros**-beautiful screen-very responsive touch screen-excellent battery life (you must leave the wi-fi off unless you are using it)-good overall feel to the device..seems solid and fits nice in your hands.-pretty decent web browsing (youtube etc)-custom sized text sizes, (you can go from Small to very large)-expansion micro sd card slot, (supports up to 32gb) for music, documents etc, note you CANNNOT Store e-books purchased from bn.com on the card!**cons**-diffcult to read in direct sunlight, (due to the technology used for the color display)-books CAN Be expensive, but are generally slightly less than retail, no physical book means you don't have tons of read books cosuming space around your home.-nearly have to pay for ALL APPS, (angry birds, etc)-Wimpy single speaker that is HARD to hear even with volume turned all the way up- if no screen protector is put on this device, you will have greasy smudges and fingerprints galore. invest in a good screen protector i would suggest the 2X caseen Glareshatter. here is the link: [...]-sometimes the nook color will freeze, prompting you to restart.also, you will want to purchase a cover for the nook color to keep it from getting scratched, or banged up here is the link to the black moko case i have.[...]Considering what it does, it is a great device, its not a $800.00 ipad, so if you purchase this with the expectation of it functioning like an ipad YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. this is a nice color e-reader with basic web browsing, email reading and sending capabilites, so if you wanna check your email and do some light web browising, this is for you. the battery life is amazing, but this is only true if you KEEP THE WIFI OFF. if your wifi is left on, and your not using it, battery life will be short. i only turn on wifi when im downloading a new book (takes about 30 seconds) and when im doing email or web browsing. the web browsing feature is ok, but no subsititue for your desktop or notebook. just keep this in mind.all in all, a good purchase, very pleased with my nook color!update 11/15/13*** e-reader seems to be performing well.if you LEAVE THE WIFI OFF you can get very long battery life.this device was great for its time, but since being released back in 2010 better things have come out.its fine for reading..but not much else.",positive
"I've owned the Sony PRS-500, Kindle 1, 2 & 3, Sony PRS-350SC and the Nook Color. Each one has advantages, but none more than the B&N; Nook Color. Hold the Nook in your hand and you hold a reader, tablet PC, MP3 player, and photo viewer. It seems like it should be a work-out, but no so. With an optional leather cover (many cool choices at B&N;'s site) it weighs in at about a pound. Heavier than the Kindle? Sure, but also does so much more.The features that make this a stand-out are the 7"" color touch screen, full keyboard, and Android-based browser. The browser is a MAC, so Flash video is not supported, but all others are. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, email and everything else appears just as it does on your PC. Page turns are an effortless swipe on the screen.Two things I consider drawbacks are, first and foremost, the battery life. Don't expect more than 7 or 8 hours. B&N; says 10 days, but that's in hibernation mode. That drawback is kind of big. I'm forever charging the Nook, and charge time is 4-5 hours. The other drawback is backlighting, which is unfortunate but necessary for the brilliant color screen. Adust the page color in ""Settings"" and reduce the eye-strain.Aside from the battery life, the Nook Color is the best thing going out there. You'll enjoy carrying up to 8,000 books (with added SD memory card), staying connected with Wi-Fi, and it all comes to life on the long-overdue color touchscreen. Open, connect, enjoy.",positive
"Ordered the e Reader for Christmas last year. As of today, my daughter is using it and loving it. She says, no regret she loves it.",positive
"I initially purchase the Nook Color last year as a cheap alternative for a web device to check email and surf and read a few books now and then when not lugging my laptop around.  When they upgraded and opened the Android capabilities it became an Android Table PC with dedicated email app and improved web goodies.  At last check they now have 366 apps and growing, most are kid stuff and games but do have some useful apps for weather, calendar, note taking, Flight checker, etc.  I can transfer Word, Excel, photos and music to it and learn more each time I mess with it.The one thing missing was a 3G capability of the black n white version.  Both 3G and Bluetooth are built into the guts but who knows if and when they will be turned on.  My solution is Virgin Mobiles Broadband2Go MiFi wireless that supports up to 5 connections.  You can use it for as little as 10 bucks for 10 days or 20 bucks for a month and more options.  I've used the USB version as a backup when traveling for about 3 years so felt OK with the WiFi version.  Works fine with the Nook, did have to use `Forget' and reconnect the first time but now have a fall back `secure' WiFi connection.Doesn't have some of the fancy features of bigger better and more costly Table PCs but for everyday email and surfing, ez to carry around with a nice cover, enough apps to suit in general with more to come it more than meets my needs and NO monthly bills to use it.",positive
"Not quite a full-fledged tablet, not a dedicated e-reader...and that's OK with me for $249!  I had my first two NookColors replaced, the first due to a SD card holder spring that failed after 90 days and the second due to an unresponsive touch screen and problems with powering on.  Customer service had me on the phone for about 45 minutes and took me through two factory re-sets before I finally convinced them to replace my second unit.  Note that all replacements of defective devices are re-furbished, not new.  Finally, I am experiencing what Barnes & Noble had in mind.  NookColor #3 works great and now that I have a unit with a touch screen that works as it should I am finally realizing what a great little machine this can be, with a really solid e-reader and nice add's like Pandora and other apps, as well as wi-fi web browsing that really works well for a function that is secondary to the NookColor's primary role as an e-reader.  I really appreciate being able to listen to any selection from my iTunes library straight off the SD Card while reading or surfing the web or playing around with a couple of the apps I bought. Standard quality MP4 video files play smoothly, and most were converted to that format via third party software on my PC (My VideoConverter). The app store is still under-developed and I really wish this had 3G capability so I'd have an excuse for taking it with me more often, but at such a low price compared to 3G tablets, I have become very enamored of this machine.  The questionable quality control, a screen that is reflective in bright light and the weight of the device with cover are my only complaints, and if I had not encountered the quality problems I mentioned this would have been a solid 4- or 5-Star review, especially considering the price vs. competing tablets (because it really is in the tablet category, especially with Android 2.2 froyo installed).",positive
I have had my Nook Color for about three months now and I must say it has been one of the easiest devices to root.  This is a great bargain for $249 once you turn it into a full fledged Android tablet.  Forget about Nooky Froyo and go directly for Cyanogen mod).  You can then install the B&N Nook reader app and Amazon's own Kindle App (along with 1000's of other apps like Angry Birds).,positive
"We bought two of these - the amount of reading we're doing has significantly increased. Since it is epub compatible, we can borrow from the library, download from guthenberg and google, as well as purchase from bookstores. The screen is bright and visible in the sun. Wireless N connectivity is fast and easy. Web browsing is fast and useful. PDF, MS Office document viewers work well. Battery life is surprisingly good.  We have two of these and an ipad - the Nook Color is what we're tending to use - mainly because of the size and weight. The ipad's chiefly used as an expensive toy.Barnes and Noble bet the farm on this device and it paid off.",positive
"I think that all international customers should be forewarned that Barnes and Noble prevents you from being able to purchase any books online from their bookstore, you will be sent emails stating that books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States. This is all despite having an international credit card accepted all over the United States (even by Barnes & Noble themselves as this is the same card that I used to pay for my B&N; membership) and despite even giving them my US postal and physical address where all of my packages would be signed for  by a real person.The thing that angers me the most is that I explained to Barnes & Noble (via phone) that I live in Trinidad and they said that it would not be a problem for me to purchase books, but after purchasing a Nook color plus additional items such as screen protectors, a leather case and a 32 gig Sandisk memory card (all bought on Amazon), I have not been able to purchase a single book.If International Customers are not welcome, there should at least be some type of warning on their website. I feel like I was ripped-off by Barnes & Noble, and the sad thing about it is that I bought it all as a birthday gift for my wife. Shame on Barnes & Noble, that sales rep lied to me just to make a sale, my money was good enough for them but I am not good enough for their product. Now I have this New Nook color with all of these extras just gathering dust.It is sad to see just how low some companies will stoop to make a dollar.The real slap in the face is that after registering the nook on the Barnes & Noble website for the purpose of purchasing books, they have no problem sending me offers week after week to purchase even more of their products but as far as I am concerned, they have lost this customer permanently.P.S. This review has nothing whatsoever to do with Amazon.com, my gripe is with Barnes & Noble for giving false information to secure a sale and caring nothing about International Customers.(UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE)In the interest of fairness to Barnes & Noble and giving you Amazon.com community 100% reliable information I decided to open an account with a bank that's based in the USA to see if B&N; would be able to access the funds from that account, I'm trying to find out whether it's a location issue or just a payment issue so we can all know for sure.I decided to try this little experiment because I just can't understand how I can gain access to sample books from B&N; but every time I try to purchase one there seems to be a problem, what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B&N; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card (books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States).I now have a Bank Of America Visa Debit Card which I have not tried as yet, it is possible that the issue with Barnes & Noble is that they cannot access funds from my Scotia Master Card which is based in Trinidad so I will give the Bank Of America card a try seeing that it's based in the USA and if that does not work then the last resort will be to try using my Pay Pal account. I'll post an update as to whether it worked or not.(UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE)I'm sorry for taking so long but anyway, let us get on with it.  As I said before, every time I tried to purchase a book there seems to be a problem, what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B&N; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card (books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States).Well I found out that IT IS POSSIBLE to purchase books on the Nook once you are using a US based card. I was not able to purchase books using my Scotia Master Card but I had no problem whatsoever when using my Bank of America Visa Card, so it definitely has nothing to do with our geographical location, or IP address. The only issue that I see here is the fact that not everyone has access to a US Bank Card but you may still have a chance with making purchases via PayPal.I have noticed that there are some US based sellers that have problems accessing funds from Trinidad based Credit Cards, some even have problems accessing funds from US based Cards although they are also in the US themselves, in cases like this I've found that the best payment method to avoid any headaches is via PayPal. I've never had any issue when paying via PayPal, even when other forms of payment could not work.I hope that this helps a little.",positive
I bought this used but I was pleasantly surprised that it was like new. I rooted it and made itA Droid pad. I'm using it right now to write this. I like it better than my ipad.,positive
"I am new to nook color and bought over 40 books on the day I purchased the device, naively thinking that all Publishers adhered to the text size options available within nook (the 6 letter 'A' images incrementing from very small to the largest). Much to my dismay when I later had time to go through all of the books I'd purchased and play with text sizing and font options, I found that this was not the case. Indeed, the maximum size for many of the texts was too small to be read by people with visual impairments.My plea to Barnes & Noble, Publishers, Amazon and other vendors who produce ebooks is to please keep pepole with visual disabilities in mind and adhere to standards that will meet various needs. In the US alone, there are millions of partially sighted people who need for text to be enlarged, made bold, underlined, etc. My feeling is that 'corrected' versions of these books should be released and people who have already purchased them should be given the option to get free download replacements.Personally, I have visually impaired people in my family and I will no longer purchase any book that does not at least allow for larger text sizes.Nook color is a great device but in the end it is only as good as the software and texts that is uses, so for now I rate it 3 stars until the above issues are addressed and implemented. I know I speak for many, and thank you for your time and consideration.",positive
I purchased for my wife as a gift and she loves it. Product met all of her needs and  she loves being able to just select a book and download it without any hassle. Battery lasts a good amount of time and I can now sleep at night without a flashlight beaming in my face on accident!,positive
"It'll be gone soon, and I can't say I'll miss it. Our county library lends out e readers for patrons to try so I got on the list and after three months it was my turn to try the Kindle Color Nook. It doesn't overwhelmingly impress me though the color and clarity of the screen is as good as Our Kindle Fire's. Text on the screen is clear and turning the pages is easy. ONE advantage the Nook has over the Fire is that it shows page numbers instead of the Fire's percent of book read. Mrs. Spudman would prefer to have page numbers but has adapted to the percents.My wife and I are both comfortable navigating the Fire and barely had to refer to the owner's e manual. I don't like moving around on the Nook, and that may be solely because I'd become used to the ease of the Fire. Trying to surf the web on the Nook was very frustrating, and watching movies or video clips on the Nook was an ordeal with herky jerky motion, slow responses, and freezes. We watch free TV shows on the Kindle Fire with smooth enjoyment.The Fire was a gift to my wife from me. She loves it. If I were to buy a small device for reading, I'd prefer to  buy a tablet and download a reading program on it that enables book downloads. That method may preclude the ability to get free books (it does on the Kindle), but it's a circumstance I'd accept.In summary, the Color Nook is pretty good as a reader. Those with children might be intrigued by the animation capacity of the Nook on some children's books and the option to have the book read aloud by the Nook voice. As a web browser, the Nook , in my experience, doesn't work as well as the Fire does.In choosing between the two devices, I chose the Fire because I prefer the Amazon site to B&N;'s, like the vast number of Kindle books on Amazon, and was totally persuaded by the vast array of  free books, movies, and TV shows that come with Amazon prime.",positive
"Very disappointed with this device:*) Touch screen is quirky, buggy and unpredictable.*) No way to get back to where you were if your finger happens to slip... very bad.*) Doesn't display side loaded DRM epub covers correctly.*) Freezes up fairly often, especially browser.*) When hooking up to a computer, files often get corrupted, device freezes after you restart, 'home' screen gets messed up, etc, power down button misbehaves...I've had to unregister and start from scratch 3 times already because of these issues.*) B/N hardline pop oriented marketing sucks.*) B/N bookstore misrepresents, mislabels books - show one cover, get a different book. You can end up paying for a Gutenberg press item that they displayed with a phoney commercial cover.*) Dictionary is limited in its vocabulary, and you can't access the dictionary by itself, nor does it link to other words or references.This is a compromised reader and a compromised tablet. I'm sorry I bought it. I've never used a Kindle (nor will I ever) but besides the Kindles, if you want a GOOD reader, get a Sony T1. If you want a tablet, buy a real tablet.",positive
"I already had two of these in the household, but my son has been asking for his own since the first day I got mine. I am very pleased with the Nook Color as it does a wide range of functions. I have been able to do my university homework and write papers on mine, in addition to reading ebooks, .pdfs, and watching videos. My daughter reads, listens to music, and watches videos. My son will be making use of reading books for his age group and reading level, and watching instructional videos.",positive
"The Nook Color is a reasonably priced device that will allow you to download multiple books and store them as well as access email.Right now it only has one book in it and has not been used for email since we have three computers readily accessible. I had a D-Link router which the Nook could never ""lock onto"" via wifi, so I changed the router to a Cisco, Linksyn which solved the wifi problem. Downlaoding books from Barnes & Noble is a little too easy once you set up an account with them and the books are somewhat expensive considering they are only electronic and intangible ($14.00 for a 300+ page book).",positive

I am dis-satisfied with b&n nook this product is only good at their site. and the choice of books and apps is poor compared to kindle,positive
"I purchased a NOOKcolor a couple of months after it came out.  Within a week I had to return it because it would not charge.  A lot of hassle was required to get a replacement and it took a couple of weeks to get to me.  Once I got it set up I used it about 7 times and it locked up on the home page.  It took 2 days of conversing with a tech before they finally decided to send me another replacement.  I received my 3rd one and it lasted exactly 43 hours.  Screen went black and the lower right corner heated up to the point it was too hot to hold.  This time they were nicer about agreeing to send me a replacement.  The 4th one is sitting, unopened, in a box in front of me.  Well, after having trouble with three of them I no longer feel I can trust this device to work consistently (unless you consider always breaking as a form of consistency!) and would like to get a complete refund.  So far B&N; (the site I bought it from) won't do that for me.Moral(s) of the story:1. Stick with a Kindle - I bought an early version of it and still love it.  And if you want color go wtih the Kindle Fire.2. Only buy products though Amazon since they are very lenient and curteous about returns.  (They weren't selling the NOOKcolor when I purchased mine.)It's now about a year later and I'm still trying to get my money back.  My plan is to take this unopened box, all receipts and emails to a nearby B&N; store and hope pleading in person will get me a full refund.Wish me luck!",positive
"I got this as a gift about 5 months ago.  It does a few things well, like being backlit so you can read it at night with no lights.  After that it is all downhill.  Battery life is about that of a really long life laptop.  At the store they told me not to expect anything better than 8 hours.  And if you are not connected to wifi like I was not at a cabin for 2 weeks you can't even set the time, there is no function to do that.  I mean really...  and if you want to archive a book you can't because that is only an on-line function.  Any files you add can only be deleted when connected to a laptop.  In bright sunlight it is barely visible unless you find some shade.  If you are not connected to wifi and your book expires, then the little book icon gives you a message that says ""The content is no longer available"".  What that content is remains a mystery to me and you cannot fix the error until you connect to wifi, after which it miraculously fixes itself.All in all this may be usable like a really slow laptop around the house, but for traveling its not worth lugging around.  Really, why even use it around the house when I have a fast laptop already that does a lot more.  This thing is just not ready for prime time, paper books beat it hands down.  Get a good LED book reader light and keep your $.I asked at the store if I could return it and they said only within the first 2 weeks with a receipt, so buyer beware...big time!",positive
"Barnes & Noble NOOK COLOR eBook Reader Tablet (WiFi Only) w/ SanDisk 1GB microSD CardI won't get into all the things this amazing eReader can do. You can read all the other 5 star reviews for these details.But here's a really IMPORTANT one that shouldn't be overlooked when considering the purchase of an eReader.On the Nook, you can read THOUSANDS of FREE fiction and non-fiction books (from most local libraries) that are in the EPUB format.The Kindle cannot do this.",positive
"The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc.  It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy.  A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own ""flavor"" of Android for this reader.  While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption.  As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan.  You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment).  Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).",positive
"The new Nook ""Simple Touch"" is easy on my eyes for long reading sessions.  The Nook makes it easy to chose a font style, a font size, single spacing or double spacing...you can customize the appearance of the text to your needs.It is easy to read the Nook indoors with any decent room lighting, and easy to read outdoors in the shade.  It is July in Texas...so I have not tried using it in direct sunlight.The Nook is easy and comfortable to hold in one hand for extended periods of time.  Turning pages is easy with a light touch on the side of the screen or a press of the page button in the sideframe.The battery took a couple of full charge/discharge cycles to stabilize. At that point, it was using about 2% of the battery for each hour or two of reading.  Reading an hour or two hours a day and using the Wi-Fi an hour or two per week would result in 3 weeks or 4 weeks per charge.  In contrast, my color e-reader requires charging each day.Magazines look MUCH better on my color e-reader, but magazine text is very readable on the Nook.  The Nooks is at its best with a book with plain text, as illustrations, art, drawings, etc. look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.  Because I can increase font size and use double-spacing on the Nook, it is much easier to read on the Nook than in the paperback book.  My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the ""fine print"" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.  If you will be reading books, you will like the NOOK Simple Touch. Look around and compare price...the price of the Nook varies widely between stores.",positive
"I bought three of these. I was very very happy of the performance with the original 1.0.1 firmware. However, two of them already upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware, which immediately erased the ability to use the ""look"" functions as internet browser.One of the readers frost during update and it doesn't recognize the ""nook"" menu button anymore...I will return it, luckily it is within the original retail return period.The second reader seems OK. It is less responsive now though, after the ""upgrade""...Will test it with imported through Callibre books tonight, if it is still OK after firmware update.The third reader hasn't updated yet, I don't know why. I will return it anyway - I don't want to take the risk.Conclusion: B&N; completely ruined otherwise not bad reader by buggy and restrictive firmware update. It is definitely not worth the money right now.I have the first generation Nook too, and in general I preferred Nook due to the epub support. I integrated with Callibre and used embedded fonts for non-Latin epub books.I promoted my Nook readers to friends until this firmware update, because of the OK hardware and epub support. However, considering that B&N; is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device. It is OK if given free for a brand new unit.",positive
"I recently bought a Nook and when I bought it home for the first time, I was impressed. The user interphase (much improved over Nook 1st gen) was optimized for the large touchscreen and is much better than the simple list UI of the new Kindle touch. Holding the device was also pleasant and the page turn buttons were a great addition that the Kindle touch desperately lacks. Hardware and software wise, the product itself is perfect as a functional and easy to use e-Reader.However, when I started to look for books to purchase (they were about investing if you were curious), out of the five books I tried to find, I ended up only being able to find one of the books I wanted. I purchased this device having read half a dozen reviews, and the reviewers all commented on how comparable the book selections for Amazon and Barnes and Noble are, but the truth is, B&N; still has a ways to go.I am aware the the Nook supports e-pub which allows it to read generic pdf files (something that the Kindle can't do), but one of the features I look for in e-readers is convenience. Having to buy a book from Google books on my laptop and then transferring it to my Nook is not convenient. If only this device had the Kindle store on it...Bottom line: When you buy an e-reader, you're also buying into the manufacturer's entire ecosystem. With the Kindle, you're buying material from an expanding and reliable retailer that's not going away anytime soon. With the Nook, you're buying material from a reputable but inconsistent company whose mettle has yet to be tested in the e-reader space.Two word recommendation: Research selection (before purchase)I hope I've helped.",positive
"I am so pleased with my new Nook Touch. I have already purchased 4 books and am reading them all. The best part is that there are so many good books that are free ( even one OT/NT free Bible)and most others are under $10. There is also the ability to read samples of books before you buy without going out of the house because the Nook has Wi-Fi.I really like everything about it, especially the fact that there is a battery that can be changed by B&N; or by me after the warranty is out and the ability to visit B&N; store for help.I would highly recommend.",positive
"For what I wanted it to do, namely display some of the pdf files and books that I already have on hand, this does a pretty poor job of it. The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf. There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you. The settings page is a joke, there is almost no customization to be had there. The shop's main view was nonfunctional out of the box; every time I tried to access it, it kicked me back out to the main page, and I had to access it by going to the ""top 100"" page instead, and even then the search would sometimes not work. The battery capacity went down 20% over 4 days, so I don't think that it would make the 2 month mark that it should have.For all of it's failings, it gets much better once it is rooted, as underneath it all, it is still an android 2.1 device. Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader. You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.The reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default. The default software that comes with it feels unfinished and lacking in features to me, and it seems like B&N; were just being lazy when putting it together. Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software. I would rate this as 4/5 if it came unlocked by default.",positive
"Haven't had it but a few weeks, but I am learning how to download from the library, etc.  love how light it is and that it will tuck away in a purse for easy reading anywhere.  No operating problems so far.  Would recommend it for home or away&#34;",positive
"Product shipped quickly, and arrived slightly ahead of schedule, even from the other side of out country.The stated storage capacity is rather misleading. It says 2gb, but half of that seems reserved for the system, and most of what's left is reserved for B&N;'s ebooks. That leaves about 250mb for the rest of your library.Fortunately, a 4gb microSD card cost me a measly $5. Even better, memory card integration is seamless.Amazon's got a great price, too. $10 cheaper than anyone else. Ironic, considering the Nook is their direct competitor.One thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook, regardless of font size or line spacing, so you can turn through page 85 two or three times before getting to page 86. It's a little weird, but not a major issue.I got my paws on one of these things in the store, and I'm still surprised at how light and small it is.The last consideration (not really an issue, but an odd choice on their part) is the lack of a file manager on the device. You have to plug the Nook into a computer to delete files. However, it's irrelevant, since all of my ebooks are on the memory card, and I bought a USB adapter for that very reason.All in all, this is a fantastic product, and I am very pleased with it.",positive
"Here's my take on NST:  This is a very nice, but very limited reader.  I LOVE THE DISPLAY.  That's it.  A real home run?  Not quite...Quick summary is that they won't sell me any other unit with an LCD (I spend all day looking at one of those, I don't want another one for my fun-reading).  I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet, and that won't be from B+N.Here are the problems with the whole Nook thing.(1) You can't use it for a PDF, magazine, or anything with graphics because YOU CANNOT ZOOM OR ROTATE. I have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you can't see.  Guess they want you to get the color tablet-like Nook, huh?  Nope, not going there (see above).(2) YOU CANNOT SHARE BOOKS. Yeah, yeah, they SAY you can, but that's VERY LIMITED and makes no sense.  (If the publishers trust them enough with their DRM to have the book at all, why can't you transfer the book to someone else using the same DRM?) I can get a paperback, read it, and share it forever.  Not so with Nook and you know it.(3) B+N (and everybody's) E-BOOKS COST THE SAME AS A NEW PAPERBACK, even though the seller didn't incur any cost of printing, shipping, inventory, etc.  But I can get a paperback for 25% off at my local Kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers, or I can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at 50% (or more) off list.  When everybody in my family has read that book, I can sell it to the used book store for 15% or 25% of list value.  That's a win-win.So, where's the advantage with a Nook other than it's cool?  Three strikes (it could get one more if you count fragility compared to a paperback book).  This whole e-reader thing is bravo-sierra at this point.That's my $0.02.  Just wish I had known this before I spent the hundred dollars.",positive
"OK, I got this thing and plugged it in as instructed, to which it responded by doing Nothing.  After some further research, I found that it likes to be updated.  I followed the instructions on the Nook website and downloaded the newest version and ... Nothing.  The little monster came back just as dumb as before.  It does show cute screens, but not yet anything productive.  So far, Not Impressed.",positive
"I must admit I was a skeptic regarding ebooks. I thought nothing could beat a good ole paperback in my hand. after purchasing 2 of these for my wife and I on a whim I have to admit, I love it.Allows me to read books more quickly,not sure why, faster page turning, easier to find where you left off, maybe easier to read for longer periods of time, easier to carry with you anywhere maybe?.Adjustable font size so you don't have to squint at small print, display is just like a real page, and you can flip pages with a swipe, a touch, or using the buttons on either side. I can't compare it to a Kindle because I never owned one, but my understanding is that it allows more formats than the kindle does.so simple to transfer books from my computer, or purchase books via WIFI at B&N; or at home, or even borrow from my local library online!can't say enough great things about it, my wife and I were thrilled with them, not really any cons, wifi is difficult to connect in some places, thats pretty much it",positive
"I purchased the Kindle (Wi-Fi) and the original Nook (the B&W; one) and tried them out during the return period. While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR). I got one via pre-order when they came out in early June.  It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook STR, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the ""slide to unlock"" feature like the iPhone. The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine. I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.In response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond, the pre-order Nook STR I had suffered from that problem.  The touchscreen would become slow to respond, and eventually quit working altogether.  A power cycle generally brought it back.  I started a thread on B&N;'s website about this and found many others having the problem.  I did take my Nook STR back to B&N; and they exchanged it.  Have had the replacement Nook ST for six weeks now and the problem hasn't returned.  So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).  This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.The Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.  Using the device is easy enough, but loading books from a library website (via Adobe Digital Editions) requires a few steps to complete.  If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.One last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the ""Shop"" tab to access B&Ns; website.  Every Friday B&N; offers a free book for download, and has discounts on other days of the week.",positive
"the reason ill take a eInk reader over a kindle eInk reader,  is because the nook has expandable memory (up to 32GB). when you get to the fire and nook color/tab its a different story. the simple touch is light weight and the battery life is amazing. if you just need an eReader with out browsing the web this is perfect. feels great in the hand, the screen size is just right and loading books are very easy. although if you can afford a simple touch with glow i would say get that one for the light.the only thing you have to get use to is the screen being a little jumpy when you switch from one thing to another. i believe its because of the eInk style.",positive
"(I'm writing my review in amazon because B&N; ""Block"" my review arguinf  it  violates the Terms of Use of B&N...; Ironic don't you think :/, anyway this is my original review of the ebook Reader)The readers is fine in general:Pros:- Nice physically materials- Best Graphic User Interface than Kindle- Nice e-ink screen- Great speed of screen refreshing- Touch screen response is wonderfulCons:- Physically buttons for Back and Forward are kind of hard To press- No Landscape Mode... I don't understand why :(- No Web Browser or RSS reader app or something like that- PDF reader usually do not render properly if the pdf has Tables, Bullets, Images and other graphic different from text.- You Can Not Delete, move or rename Files from the device User Interface, you always have to connect it to the computer to do this actions... this makes you waist a lot of time.- The device has a hidden partition used to store the books you purchased at B&N; store. You cannot have access to that partition (with or without computer) in order to delete this purchased books.- You can not export your Highlight or Notes from the books. Kindle is a step forward with this ""most have"" feature.- The reader does not have the option to Lock the screen with a secret password or Dots combinations like Android phoness. Remember that you have stored your credit card inside the account of the device!!- The Home screen lacks the options for fold or expand the 3 sections: Reading now, library and Next Readings.",positive
"I have had this a few days and I love it! It arrived earlier than expected which is a plus! I have never had a nook before so I'm unsure whether my problem is an issue with my nook or all nooks but the power/sleep button on the back is loose feeling and is hard to press. Other than that, I have barely put this thing down since it arrived (: good thing I'm on winter break from school!",positive
"We have only been using the product for a couple of weeks now, but it is working great.  My wife and my daughter both love it and find it very easy to use.",positive
"I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.",positive
"We bought one of these for my mother-in-law hoping to get her a piece of technology that would be enjoyable for her to use. It has been nothing but a pain. Her main thing she uses it for is reading books from the library. This requires a process that involves going through hoops, a computer, and an Adobe ID and software. Having experience with an Amazon Kindle (the very basic one) and iPads with library books, this was an absolute pain and I feel bad for my in-laws. What should be a two-five step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook. There have been several occasions where my father-in-law (who is ok with technology) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.I would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the Nook itself. Otherwise, it is nothing but frustrating.",positive
"First let me qualify my comments.  If you are looking for an all purpose ePad or IPAD alternative, buy another product!  That's clearly not what Barnes and Noble designed this unit for.  It's not intended to surf the web, check email, etc.  It is an eReader...PERIOD!Having said that, in my opinion, it is the best out there right now.  It is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback.  It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.  The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.The battery life is insane.  If you turn off WIFI, which should be normal unless you are looking for another book, the battery doesn't need recharging for weeks on end.  Page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen.  Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.  I found most of the time I don't use them.It has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation.  I had a 1st generation Nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for Bibles or Reference books.  It reads ePub format so more than half of what I read comes from the public library.It is not going to be great for color magazines and so on.  You will need a Nook Color or an ePad like Xoom or IPAD for that.  But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.  If you come across a word you are unfamiliar with you just touch it and up pops an option look it up.  I think Barnes and Noble has a winner here.",positive
"I purchased 2 of these in November of 2011. We had a baby on the way and I anticipated lots of reading time. They were so inexpensive I got one for me & one for my wife.I find the reading experience with the Simple Touch great. The pearl e-ink display has great contrast, and pages turn pretty quickly. I keep the wifi off and battery life is really good. I don't think it's quite as good as BN claims (2 months reading time?) but I can go weeks without charging. I've only purchased a few books though the BN store, I mostly side-load them using Calibre, which works great.My wife doesn't read hers as much as I read mine, and the touchscreen on hers will go unresponsive. Holding down the ""n"" button on bottom-front while holding down the top back button forces it to rebook and come back to life. It hasn't been a major issue though.I purchased aVerso Arc Light for Kindle, Nook, & Other eReaders - Blackand it works well for reading in low-light situations. The Simple Touch with GlowLight wasn't an option when I bought mine.Overall it's a great, versatile, light small e-reader.",positive
"I just received this reader after returning a gifted Kindle.  Nice screen and seems much more white than the Kindle Touch I returned.  I did root it to run Android, so it tends to lag in apps that it was never meant to run, but in reader apps, it's great.  It also has a micro SD slot (32GB works fine) which is the main reason I chose it.  That and the fact that it is so easily rooted, with a large support community.  I liked the Kindle's sleek looks more than the Nook, but the screen on this is definitely better for reading (can't speak for the new Kindle Paper White).  I haven't read outdoors with it yet, so no info there.  Now I have a ton of ebooks and, more importantly, all my college text books in PDF format.  In fact now that it's rooted, I can read any format file by getting an app (including the Kindle app!).  Web browsing is okay with Opera mobile.  Email is great.  Video is not possible, but eink offer a couple of months of battery life (even a few weeks would be great) which makes up for any shortfalls.  I leave my laptop home most days now.  Bottom line: It's the perfect addition to the modern student's toolkit (If you've got a little technical know-how).",positive
"I'll make it simple. I loved my NOOK. I bring to school every single day and have sixty-plus books on there. It's great because it's light, it's portable(it fits in my pocket!), and most importantly, it has all my books at once. It can most definitely be read in direct sun, and I was pleasantly surprised that Barnes and Noble did not lie in the slightest when they advertised no glare. You can side load any pdf or epub file, as well as downloading books from the store. The book management is simply fantastic. The reading quality is also great because you can change font size as well as the font itself.However, on day I picked it up and I couldn't unlock it. I wasn't very worried, because the NOOK occasionally doesn't respond to touch because the infared sensors are blocked by dust and dirt. But it still wouldn't respond after cleaning it as well as five hard reboots, which were the only thing the BN support line could offer. I feel dissapointed but ordered the new Glowlight and hope that it will last longer, because it was just great while it lasted. I hope you have a better experience with your NOOK- if, that is, you decide to buy this older model.",positive
"I have had my nook simple touch for a few weeks now- I previously owned a Sony Reader pocket edition, and I own a iPad. This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose.It was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.I really like holding it to read- I generally read ridiculously thick books, so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up (and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad- the iPad is fine to read from, and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue, but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand). Initially I didn't realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back, so I was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way, and it was annoying to have to use both hands. As soon as I realized that the buttons existed, the experience got even better.The battery life seems great- I charged it all the way up using my usb-to-outlet power adapter that I have for my iphone/ipad, and it worked great. I haven't had to charge it again, and I've been reading for about an hour each day.The one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that. I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again. Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources. Yes, its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won't be interested in. I would have purchased the kindle with special offers, and hadn't thought much about it, but I've enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen, and would probably get annoyed by the commercials/make a point to put my nook in a case so I didn't have to see them.Durability- I haven't abused it by any stretch of the imagination- yet- but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didn't crack/break/show any sort of damageI'll update my review as I have more time to play with it in the next few months",positive

"Great product, easy to use and set up--after comparing pros and cons this was the one for me. I especially liked that I could download books from my community library and other sites. I wasn't tied just to a brand name download. Shipped quickly too.",positive
Satisfied with this purchase. The Nook was brand new in an open box. Works like a gem. Very happy customer!,positive
"I bought this to replace a Sony PRS-300 that I thought was too heavy and too slow in the page turning.  Yes, the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but I am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter.  I am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook - I've yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions.  Why aren't nooks plug and play?  That's my first big problem.  I have no problem with my Sony and the library book I wanted is now on my Sony.  The second is that I like to read while I'm eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right.  It is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side.  The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.  I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.  I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.  I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.  I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N; as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.  I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony.**UPDATE 5/25/13**  I finally was able to download library books onto my nook but it was frustrating and time consuming; I finally found help online.  I have yet to discover a way to comfortably hold this book in my left hand and turn the page.  This was a very bad buy for me.  I bought a book-style cover for it and that was a waste of money as well as I find the cover just gets in the way.  I did not know how good I had it with the Sony PRS-300 and will continue to use my Sony instead of the nook.  I don't recommend the nook at all.",positive

"Let just start off by saying that I have tried the Kindle and although an OK hardware device, the interface was terrible.  It felt like the early days of the internet, with textual interfaces, underlined words, fiddling with buttons and keyboard to navigate, and all sorts of annoyances that got in the way of reading and enjoying the device. We returned it within 3 days.Next we tried the original Nook Black&White;, and interface was much better, but the screen had poor contrast. (not the nice Pearl screen as the Kindle has)Enter Nook Touch.  WOW.  This thing has a top notch interface... they totally put their minds and heart into this one...  it is PERFECT.  Touchscreen makes a world of a difference, and enables the slick interface that allows you to browse the store, personal library, and more.  On-screen Buttons and finger gestures make the magic happen, and this is one device you are sure to LOVE TO USE.  The screen is the new Pearl, so it looks just as good as the Kindle, with the added benefit of touchscreen!The size?  PERFECT!  Not too big, not too small.  Very thin.  Well built.  Feels durable.All I can say is this is finally the ereader I've been waiting for...  excellent battery life, good Pearl screen, touchscreen, and perfect size.To boot, the price is dead on!  $139 with Wifi.  If it gets stolen, I am buying another one immediately!",positive
"very very good value for this reader, and I am grateful for the quick exchange they made when the first unit developed a problem right away.  They immediately sent a replacement.  Immediately.",positive
"This a second generation e-reader. By adding a 16 GB micro SD card, it can store more e-books than I'll ever own. Most of my books are in PDF format. It has trouble displaying charts or images and fails totally to display an e-book in PDF form that I bought from Forbes.com. All these books display properly in PDF readers available on personal computers.It's other weakness is that it has minimal documentation. The topics are covered but the explanaitons leave the user with a lot of questions.",positive
Wife bought this for her elderly mother - but she couldn't quite get the hang of using it (tech challenged)... My wife has been using it instead and seems to like it pretty well... All is good :),positive
"This is the third ebook reader I've used and definitely the best.  The Franklin eBookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer.  The Ectaco Jetbook Lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well, plus an extremely user-unfriendly upgrade method.I did encounter one major problem with this Nook Simple Touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised (with wifi off).  Fortunately, however, I called B&N; Customer Service, and they advised me to install the latest firmware, V1.0.1, which addresses the power issue.The upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches, and it seems to have solved the problem; though I haven't put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet, the charge indicator is holding at 100% after a full day, including more than an hour of reading.  That compares very favorably to the 83% discharge rate I had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware.  I will report back if the battery problem returns.Otherwise I prefer the Nook Simple Touch's ergonomics to the comparable Kindle.  The Nook's front is all screen, with no unnecessary keyboard keys.  Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.  The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.  You have a choice of font styles and sizes, and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight.  You can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition (provided, I found, that the word isn't hyphenated and run on two lines).I like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library (you download to Adobe Digital Reader, which your library provides free, and then transfer the Epub books to your Nook with the USB cable provided).  The program recognized my Nook without any glitches.I also like being able to read any book for an hour a day FREE at the nearby B&N; store.Newbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N; left out a few useful ones.  Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter ""library.""  To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.  And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.So if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics, take a look at this Nook.  But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!)UPDATE: Trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me.  At any rate, I bought a copy of the American Heart Association Cookbook (7th Edition) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks!I emailed B&N; Customer Support, and they suggested that I try downloading the title again (which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title, whatever that means).  That didn't work, but I found that if I clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked ""Publisher's Default"" (or words to that effect), that seemed to solve the problem.  So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!",positive
"The device itself is amazing...-great TOUCHSCREEN interface-perfect reading screen-clean looking design, small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it's smaller than the original Nook-reads formats natively that the Kindle won't-read all the ebooks you want in B&N; stores for free-library checkouts are easy-press and hold on a word to get its definition-highlight and take notes in a book easily...but when you ROOT the thing it gets even better!-Install the Gmail app to get your mail-get the Opera browser (supports Flash!)-install the Kindle app and you can read Kindle ebooks too-Put it in host mode to attach an external keyboard-Make sure to get the Home Button Savior app so you can switch back and forth between the B&N; reader and the rest of the device's functionality.I used these instructions:[Amazon removed my link.  Google ""Root Nook Touch Using TouchNooter & Install Go Launcher, NookColor Tools, Gmail, Market & YouTube"", it's the top link. ]I will be buying LOTS of these as gifts, and I'm going to root them all!  This is a perfect device for hackers and regular ebook readers too!What's a Kindle?  Never heard of it.",positive
"I don't read a ton so I didn't want to pay a huge premium for an e-reader.  I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.It wasn't quite as straight forward as I was expecting.  I initially thought it'd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and you're ready to go.  I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.  I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.  From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.  It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer(I think the Kindle is the same way as well though).The reading experience is great though.  Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.  The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.  Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.Overall I am happy with it.  I mentioned its shortcomings, but they don't outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.  From a reading standpoint I'd give it 5 stars, just some other things that popped up that aren't big deals, but noticable.  I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton of reading, but still wants a simple e-reader.  If you are a more serious reader, I'd probably spring for the Paperwhite.",positive
"I dont know why I bought this tablet, just only one day using it and I stored it in a place where it continues stored... I dont like the screen... it reflects light from many sources (sun, bulbs, etc) despite the type of technology used in the screen...the size is no convenient, I think a bigger one good be better... well, this is my opinion about this product...",positive
"I have gone thru a lot of reviews of this eBook before ordering it, mainly due to its long battery life.Within a week, it got shipped home (excellent seller).However, the product itself is far from being a good eBook Reader.I have had two: one Kindle eBook reader (with keyboard) and one 10.2"" Android tablet that I used as a reader mainly.The Nook is cumbersome:THE BADS:1) the first thing it ask for is to read some kind of agreement, then click ACCEPT !!! (like I am installing a new software !!!)2) the second thing is to setup for a WIFI access, I have troubled to enter the password for my home wireless so it sits there for one day. Can't do anything until WIFI access is established.THE GOODS3) I went to a local B&N; store to get instant WIFI access which I did,THE BAD4) then create an account, enter my credit card number (why do I need to do this at this time). Should only ask when I first order something from B&N.;THE GOOD:5) now I can copy my eBook in PDF formats to it, this part is straightforward.THE BAD:6) I opened one of my PDF doc and it came up with a huge font size7) try to touch the screen to get to a menu allowing me to change font size, the menu appears, then quickly disappears. I was very frustated trying to get the menu display to stay there8) it took me a few mins before I can get the menu to be stable, then change to a smaller size. The text now reads fine. But the ""next page"" , ""previous page"" buttons are too hard to push, it takes a hard push to get it to work.9) I close the document and try to open another one, it won't open10) try to re-open the first one, not open eitherFrom this point on, it simply refused to open any document I have on it.11) I even convert one PDF to epub format (specifically target the Nook)  and load on it, does not open either. And the epub size is much larger than PDF size (i.e. I will have a lot less books on it).To me, this eBook is useless, so I am going to return it back today.And this is not due to (or lack of) my high tech proficiency (I develop firmware for ""firwmare operated"" gadgets by trade , really know how to use these ""Software/firmware"" operated gadgets quite well, have at least 5 GADGETS with very complicated functionalities at home, all of them require patient readings thru their thick manuals to operate / setup to my liking, no problem at all).I have written quite a lot of product reviews on Amazon, most of the gave good rating because these products are good.I feel really frustrated with this one, the first bad review I wrote.My older two eBook readers work right of the box. Just copy the documents to it and open to read them.I will NEVER buy these kinds of eBook readers anymore, not even the new Kindle as I heard they will show ads on the screen and the Kindle Fire will just immediately buy stuff from Amazon if I accidently click on some place, IT DOES NOT even show a confirmation screen (too greedy to make money) !!! I don't buy something to read these ads. Amazon and B & N are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like, at the users expense.I will try to get a new Android tablet instead (for reading, and Internet browsing). Rather spend a few hundreds bugs to get a good product than a cheap one that does not work.Many users were lucky to get the ones that work (touch scree sensitivity seems to be the key here), I was not and don't want to try my luck with it again.",positive
"I bought this Nook Simple Touch on Amazon.com, but when I received it, the WiFi would not connect. I tried my home network as well as several WiFi hot spots around town. Barnes & Noble Customer Service was NO HELP, telling me that, since I did not purchase the Nook Simple Touch from B&N;, they could not help me, and suggesting that I needed to return it to the seller. I did return it, thinking it was damaged somehow, and the seller graciously gave me a full refund with no argument (kudos to him and Amazon!).Later, I bought one from B&N;, and it had the same problem. Again, B&N; Customer Service was NO HELP, but did send a replacement. The replacement has the SAME PROBLEM and will NOT CONNECT to WiFi. Now, I'm arguing with B&N; for a full refund.Most of the reviews are glowing. But what they don't say is that B&N; has this WiFi connectivity problem very commonly with the Nook Simple Touch. Even the B&N; Forum has many references to the problem.I'm not saying that you should not buy one of these Nook Simple Touches, and maybe you will not have the same problem. Just beware.CAVEAT EMPTOR!",positive
"This arrived as described, packaged well, and worked well. The only issue I have ever had with them is its not as user friendly as it could be. I had to go to online blogs to find the rest of the steps to download an eBook. Whether it was from Barnes and Noble or the library.",positive
"I previously owned a Kindle and loved it, but it kept breaking.  I finally gave up in frustration after having it replaced 3 times in the first year.I bought the Nook Simple Touch to replace it, and am very satisfied with my purchase.To be honest, the Kindle is brighter and easier to read in less-than-perfect light.  However the Nook excels in nearly every other way.1) Nook is sturdily reliable.  I have had no failures with it whatsoever, although I carry it everywhere and use it daily.  I do have it in a protective case, but I had my Kindle in a protective case and it kept breaking anyway.  POINT:  NOOK.2) Nook Simple touch is smaller and lighter than the equivalent Kindle e-reader.  Nevertheless, screen-size is ample.3) Nook is responsive and seems faster at turning pages than Kindle.4) Books download in a blink and are immediately available.  This too seems faster than with my Kindle.5) There are some things I could do with my Kindle that I can't do with my Nook Simple Touch, but I don't miss those things.  I needed a simple e-reader that just plain works and Nook Simple Touch satisfies that need in a very inexpensive way WITHOUT ADS.  POINT: NOOK.Generally, if you are shopping for an inexpensive, simple e-reader, I strongly urge you to buy the Nook, and not the Kindle.  I have tried both, and prefer the Nook.",positive
Bought this as a gift for my husband.  He didn't think he would use an e-reader.  The Nook is so easy to set up and use.  I have one too and we both read with them all the time.,positive
I bought Nook on yard sell for 35$ in great condition .And only later I found how I was lucky.  I was a devoted reader of real books all my live and never thought that I will love ebook reader. What I love about Nook that I can change size of letters on ANY e books. For exemple. I download e book PD format I made on my computer for free on kindel reader and cant read e book because prints SO small its impossible to read.  On kindle reader you can change size of letters e book only if you bought them on Kindel store. But not e book you made by yourself. I could not find Russian e book on Kindle store i would love to read . So i had to go online russian library ; download e book on my computer and convert to PD format by myself + its free .With Nook here is not a problem .All my ebooks I can read in print I wish.Just love this Nook!,positive
"This is a great and simple eBook reader. It's light enough that I can hold it in one hand when reading, it's small enough that it's easy to take with me, the battery life is long enough that I forgot where I put the charger, and the screen lets me read for hours on end without eye strain. It does one thing and does it well. Get a tablet computer (I am partial to the Toshiba Thrive) if you want to play games, do email, browse the web, do video conferencing, etc.",positive
"I've had all the other Nook's and this is the first that I truly love.  The touch screen is accurate and quick, there is no reflection at all, page turns are quicker than the other Nooks.  It's very light, the archiving and rating process is much much easier.  Shopping is easier as well.  I'm in love with my Kindle and always compared the Nook, now I love them equally.  Of all the Nooks, I think this is the best one, I love it.  I only wish it was 3g.  Barnes and Noble still seems to have an issue with the syncing of books between the readers.  When I read on this Nook (just like the other 2), it doesn't sync with online so when I then use my Iphone I'm not at my current page.  In this area, the Kindle and Amazon know what they are doing.  I'm not terribly impressed with the choice of covers for this new Nook.  I'm waiting patiently for M-Edge to release their new covers so that I can use my M-Edge light with both my Nook and Kindle.",positive
"The device physically, is relatively good for the money.  There are many reviews on YouTube and other places that address that point.  The problem with the B&N; system is the fact that you must enter a 'default credit card' to be able to use or purchase any books.  If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.  Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.  By contrast, with the Kindle system, you simply buy a book through Amazon using any credit card (which does not have to stay active) and send it to an authorized device.  The Nook system, by comparison, is slow, clunky, and a massive security risk.If you setup the Nook and do not provide this credit card during setup, no books can be sent to the Nook wirelessly, they must be sync'ed with a cable tethered to a computer.  Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.  Furthermore, it would appear that B&N; is entering into a contract with my minor daughter in this regard.  By opting out of this model, you are left with an utterly useless device.Why none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me.  I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N; altogether.I give them 2 starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device, in this case, is useless.  While you can delete your credit card from B&N;, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.  Either that or hand your child your Visa and tell them to enjoy!  Now that's what I call convenience.",positive
"It seems to be a limited device, but it has potential  I think a good price it new should be about $55.00. I have one as a backup to my kindle P.W there are two pros ,the SD card slot and it can be rooted, but rooting affects battery life and its not stable when rooted. Very very limited web browser no Facebook or anything useful, the browser on the the paperwhite is much better. It is a pretty well made device.It is a ok back up to my kindle paperwhite.",positive
"Having previously owned a Kindle, I was not expecting that e-book readers had much improved over the last year. Contrast on the display was a big problem for me, and I wasn't especially keen that the Kindle uses a proprietary book format that cannot be read on other e-readers. So, as long as I stuck buying books from Amazon for a Kindle, I was fine; the second I ever wanted to move to another device, I couldn't take my books. This didn't sit well with me.When Barnes and Noble dropped the price of the Nook Simple Touch to $99 I decided to take the plunge. (Note that as of this writing, Amazon still has not reflected the price drop.) The newer generation screen, while still not perfect, is far, far superior than earlier generations. Reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the e-reader to maintain legibility. Anyone who owns an iPad or other tablet knows how intuitive a touch interface can be, so I'm delighted to say that the navigation issues previously posed by the joystick on the older Kindle are resolved with the Nook's new touch interface.Amazon released their own Touch e-reader just recently. While it now brings the Kindle in line with the capabilities of the Nook, it still lags in one area: proprietary book format. The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books. Amazon for its own reasons chooses not to. What this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from Amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another e-reader is the better platform for you.I refuse to be a party to that kind of lock-in, which is why I am very happy with my Nook Simple Touch.",positive
"We have the old Nook reader, which we love. We purchased this Nook at target for the same price as Barnes and Noble and Amazon.This Nook is smaller, which is nice. It has a built in light, which is really nice. And, it is touch screen, which is awesome!The only flaw I see thus far is that you can't resize the letters. Apparently the letters are a standard size, I assume because of the size of the screen? Anyway, I would like to make them smaller so that I can read more before turning the page. However, that is a minor issue and does not deter me from enjoying the new Nook tremendously.",positive
While it doesn't have a light and its screen has been far surpassed by other readers throughout the years. However since it uses android you can easily root it and install apps that allows you to read Kindle books and pretty much anything else your heart desires. Even can play Angry Birds if you really wanted to.,positive
"I have owned my nook for two months now and am very happy with it.  My mom owns a Kindle, one sister a Nook Color, another sister a 1st Edition Nook...so I've seen my fair share of e-readers.  I did the research before I bought.  I actually bought my dad a Kindle 3G for Father's Day.  But the light weight of the Nook Touch was great for me.  I have problems with my hands and their abilities, so after a full day of commuting, typing, and writing, they've reached their peak.  It was the right choice for me.",positive
"My screen stopped working a week out of warranty.  Apparently, this is a common issue with the Nook Simple Touch.  Customer service told me that Barnes & Noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything.  This is not the way to treat customers.  I am canceling all my pre-orders and I will try a different ereader.",positive
"I tried to leave this review at barnesandnoble.com, but they never posted it. Oh well.The Nook Simple Touch is a great e-reader. If you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email, this is not the product for you. The e-ink screen is amazing. It looks like you are reading a physical book. I like that you can turn the page by pressing the buttons or touching the side of the screen. Either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book. This is very simple, which I love. One night, I was lying down in bed and went to lay the Nook on it's side then immediately jerked it back up before the page orientation changed. Then I remembered that it won't do that; which makes this great for reading no matter what position you may be sitting or lying in.The Nook accepts epub books; which means that you can get books from a variety of stores, not just Barnes & Noble. I found that between the B&N; store and Google Books, you can get all of the classics for free. No reason to pay for one of those ever again. Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around. Download Calibre, bring your pdf's into it and then convert them into epubs. Once you do that, you will be able to highlight and take notes like you can with the actual books.If you want a simple e-reader, the Nook Simple Touch is the best. (FYI: It's costs less on the B&N; website.)",positive
"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Amazon.com. In the past month alone, I have made at least 12 purchases.  I was browsing around just now and decided to see what Amazon.com customers thought of my newest electronic device.  I was thrilled to see the high rating, but disappointed to see the price; $40.00 more than the thing costs at B/N since its release last month.  Amazon, you need to do better here!Now to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.  As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.  I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.  B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.  My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.The touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile ""buttons"" that will allow you to change pages.  The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.  You can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories. They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.  Some people buy this expecting it to browse the web (although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack) - Play their audio files, when there is not headphone jack (Techies have discovered that it DOES have built-in bluetooth, however), and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color.  It is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easy-to-use reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand, READING!This is why I bought it - Eventually, I will get a nook color - or a Kindle *color* if they come out with one, but for now, I thoroughly  enjoy my Nook, which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful, leisurely act of reading. In my excitement, I am reading like 8 different books at once.  That is the great joy of having an e-reader - speaking to those who are, just as I used to be, resistant to the e-reading craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books, and when I get tired of reading one, another book is just a couple of swipes away. I am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost, as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and e-book management tools such as Calibre.  I am having a blast with this thing!Yesterday, I received a nice leather case for it that I purchased off Ebay for a great price.  Once again, I looked to Amazon.com first, but there simply were not good options.  I got a black leather Caseen case that also came with a screen protector for twenty bucks.",positive
"I bought it and love it.The Good StuffThe UI is a lot better than the Kindle (I bought one for my brother, so I felt the difference between them), it's really confortable to hold and read, the touch is great for navigating between de UI, but the physical buttons are my choice, takes a little time to get used to it because they are not as sensitive as the Kindle ones (that are too sensitive, I mean the basic edition), but that's a good thing since I avoid turn pages accidentaly.The structure is lightweight and really confortable, unlike Kindle, the frame around the screen es wide enough to put my fingers on it to read (I have large hands), the grip is great thanks to the rubberized exterior. It's a pleasure to read on this thing.The Not so Good StuffNot sharing on sideloaded content. If I sideload a book from other store, the sharing option gets unavailable.Not that many formats. Just Pubs and PDF. I mostly read Pub files, but it would be great if they support other formats too.Not ""send to"" option. In kindle I fell in love with the option to push content to the device via wireless. This thing doesn't have a feature like that, so WiFi is not as usable as it is on the Kindle.Overall a great product, I liked it more than the Kindle mainly because is a lot more confortable to read, better ergonomics, and the UI makes it feel a lot better.",positive
"This is an update from my initial review.This Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch was advertised by BlueProton at Amazon as having been marked down from $249.99 to $68.99, so it certainly seemed like a great deal. It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99Initially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund. The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days. My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!Because neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was ""Take the money and run!"", I'm giving the Nook a low review although later I found an update for the Nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or Barnes & Noble!I now enjoy using the Nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading,  and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with. I don't like the gray screen which requires you to face the Nook towards the light; and I don't like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights. I have to sit ""just so"" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability. Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles! Most of my library's digital books are in ePub format which is the native format of the Nook. However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software. Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.The pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software. The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.;The cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response.Over all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.",positive
"Ordered for a freind. As far as I know, his daughter is happy with it. I guess you could call him.",positive
"This is a sold update to the older nook, but gez you have to hit the webs just to find out you need to charge it OVERNIGHT in a WALL PLUG only before first usage AND that it MUST be turned on before trying to connect to windows.  Now knowing these two VERY IMPORTANT points, I can enjoy my &#34;Nook 2&#34;.",positive
"Its a good ereader.  How it compares to the kindle, I dunno I seen raves and complaints for both.For an ereader I love the nook.- battery life is awesome.  would be nice if this was solar powered like calculators.- the display looks great, even in direct sunlight more or less.- The simple touch looks cool, very simplistic. no buttons all touchscreen for the most part.- The extra $40 warrenty guarentees replacement of damaged nook.covers anytype of damage from what I understand.- Not as many CCNA/cisco books in epub as kindle but the list is growing fast.- No addswhat I dont like;- only comes with 200mb of internal memory.  You have to pick up a microSD card- Cant delete files or books, there is simply no option for it. Im hoping for a patch.which means you have to plug it in usb and delete stuff from your desktop.Its very annoying.What Id like to see;- new screensavers for download- better support for PDF files- ability to read word doc- solar power, geez why not it only makes sense.",positive
"I've used the Nook Touch and the Kindle Touch/Kindle Paperwhite extensively and the Nook is the best. Why? I'm convinced that if anyone prefers the Kindle its because they've never tried the Nook. Or they have friends that used Kindle and don't want to venture out on their own.First the Nook feels better. It has a soft plastic outside with a curved back that makes holding the device quite pleasant. It has just enough area around the screen that you can hold easily without mistakenly turning pages. And the side page turn buttons are deep enough you won't turn pages by accident. Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from. Plus the size options all make sense. For instance on the Kindle the couple smallest font sizes are so small I can't see why anyone would use them and to me it's a waste.Fourth the buttons are all well placed.Fifth there are no ads and you can even upload your own pictures.Go try one today. I'm fairly confident you'll love it.....unless you don't.",positive
"At first I was torn between the Nook Simple Touch and the Kindle Paperwhite. I chose the Nook because of price and the absence of ads while reading a book. I had though that the Nook did not have a good dictionary function, but learned otherwise after it's purchase. All one needs to define a word from the dictionary is to place their finger on the word for two seconds and then chose the Look Up option on the bottom menu displayed on the left.Sharp resolution, useful utilities, convenient scrolling functions both off on the side of and on the screen. Lightweight, durable and well designed. Essay to download free books (I suggest Project Gutenberg). For downloading free books from on line sites or from the library, you will need to download Adobe Digital Edition 2 software which is free.I suggest that you purchase additional memory. Barnes and Noble only allocates 1/4 of a GIG out of 2GIG for your personal library from non Barnes and Noble books. One gig for software to run the Nook and 3/4 for books purchased from Barnes. The best buy for external memory is 8 GIG. I also suggest that your purchase one CaseCrown leather Regal flip case sold through Amazon; they are high quality for a reasonable price.",positive
I was very hesitant to buy a book reader because I really like holding my books.  I changed my mind when I bought a bigger bookcase and filled up immediately.  This Nook is great.  It is so much lighter than my IPad to read with.  I find that I use it a lot.,positive
"In my opinion, the Nook Simple Touch is the best e-reader on the market because... well... it's simple. No distractions of email or social media, it lets me immerse myself in a book and I love it!",positive
Readability in Sunlight is super even when the sun is directly hitting the screen; can't be beat! The blacks are great and the contrasting white whites really helps these old eyes of mine! I like the Android operation too.,positive
"I bought the Nook Touch instead of the Kindle because it was on sale for $75, which is still alot to pay for something that can only be used to read books. I didn't realize that if you buy books from B&N;, you can only read them on your Nook, and not on anything else.  So even though you paid for them, those books really aren't your property.  You have no access to them if you don't use their products! Still, I liked the fact that it used ePub, and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more ePub books available.  However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N.; If I had known this I never would have bought the Nook. It's as consumer un-friendly as you can get!  Really a nasty way to do business.  Amazon is different.  Once you buy a book, it is yours.  You can read it on any device. When it comes to buying books, Amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly.  The Kindle is by far a better choice of the two.I am returning the Nook after only a week, because this is a frustrating product that doesn't function like it is supposed to do.  There are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable. Here are the cons:  First, it often takes multiple touches to access anything.  You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.  You try it again, and still nothing.  What a joke.  Second, pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning, both forward and backward.  I am always losing my place when I try to read a book.  I've noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the Nook.  If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.  Third, the pop-up menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident.  If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.  This happens several times an hour.  You can't just simply sit down, relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap. Last of all, it does not use a standard USB/micro USB cable. The USB connection to the computer is standard, but the micro USB connection to the Nook itself is NOT!  It is thinner and wider.  You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.  You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.  So if you need a longer cord, or lose their cord, you're out of luck. Talk about a major inconvenience, one that makes zero sense!  Pros: I did like that it recharges in under 4 hours and that it has a very long battery life.",positive
"I know Amazon is going to hate me for this but here goes:I used to have a Kindle 3. It was great. It made reading a pleasure however there were a couple of things I would have liked to change. I wished that it had a touch screen and that it was smaller.When I saw the Nook Touch I thought that this is what my Kindle should be like. Well I decided to buy the Nook and I'm very, very pleased. I won't go into an in depth review of the device itself. You can find that just about anywhere. What I will say is the touch screen makes things so much easier. I love the on screen virtual keyboard (like the ipad) and the fact that it's a lot smaller than the Kindle 3 but with the same size and quality screen.Since giving the Kindle to a relative I thought about the books that I already bought from Amazon and the fact that I now have to use my Android phone to read them since the Nook does not read Kindle books......or does it??With a little research I was able to find out how to root my Nook Touch (voids your warranty). Now when I turn on the Nook, it gives me a dual boot screen (sort of). I can go to the Android desktop or the the Nook screen. Using the Android desktop which included the Android market I downloaded the Kindle reading app. I ran that app, logged into my Kindle account and now have all my Kindle book available on my Nook Touch. The only thing missing is text to speech but I didn't use that feature anyway. Yes it has a web browser, email and all the other Android apps available but most look pretty drab on a monochrome device. That isn't why I did this. I wanted a device to read my Nook Books and Kindle books.I now have the best of both worlds.",positive
"If you only want to read, this is fine. The newer models access the web, have apps, play games, do email and color. This model is only print and only black and white.",positive
"Barnes and Noble hit one out of the park with this ereader! compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:- fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight- touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame- use 'shelves' to organize your titles- view titles as icons or in a list- insert bookmarks, notes- look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary- change fonts, font sizes on the fly- purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer- and much more...no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!",positive
"I love reading, and in a lot of cases I found myself leaving a book at home because I didn't want to carry any heavy things. This is great! I put in a small 512MB card and now it holds ~50 books! I gave it 4 stars only because the dictionary function isn't very good. I think it has a literal copy of a dictionary, which means it doesn't explain the word fully but still doesn't allow you to search for the meaning of a work in the translation window...",positive
"I bought this ereader and the Amazon Kindle ereader at the same time, so I could compare both together. After about a week I gave the Amazon ereader to my nephew and I kept the Nook. I am left handed, so holding things in my left hand feels natural to me. I really like how this can be held in the left hand and still have access to forward and back page turn buttons. Also, I like that it has a touch screen in addition to the physical buttons as well to turn pages. Also, and this was the biggest reason I kept the Nook. It has a more natural feel in the hand to me. My thumb rest comfortably next to the screen will reading. Overall, in my opinion this is a better ereader then the others out there.",positive
good reader. uploads books fast. I do not do wifi on this because I have heard bad things about the updates. also has problems if hooked up to a computer will take the shelves away. I have a lot of books so this is a big bad thing for me. But still is good.,positive
"Personally, I'm a kindle fan. But I got the Nook to try out the ebook loan facilities from libraries. The layout and user interface is not as user friendly as the kindle, as on the kindle, pressing the home button brings us back to the library. On the Nook, the home button opens a menu, then you need to select the options. Also, if you sort the books by &#34;Recent&#34; it does not show the most recently read books in order, but still displays books in order of &#34;recently downloaded&#34;, not a useful function.But on a positive note, the Nook combines the touch facilities and button control (to turn the pages) of both the Kindle Touch & normal kindle. The borrowing of ebook a from public libraries is done on your PC, then imported onto the Nook via Adobe Digital Editions. A bit of a hassle, but a good option which Kindles do not offer. Overall, it's a good companion to Kindle, especially if you wish to borrow library books.",positive
"I need to buy a gift for my mother's birthday and I know she likes to read books while on break at her job. I thought the Nook would be a great gift for her, after reading reviews here on Amazon that it can download and read free ebooks from library sites. Our local library offers ebooks so I thought it would be great.After getting the Nook, I learned a number of things:1. The Nook does NOT have a browser. It can only connect to the Barnes and Noble online bookstore.2. You are REQUIRED to have a valid credit card, even to download free content.3. While there is a way to root (hack) the Nook and thus enable a functional browser, it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow. I shouldn't have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionality.My mother isn't very computer savvy, and doesn't own a credit card, so I couldn't give her something like this. If it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free, it would be an ideal ereader. In it's current form, it's an overly-complicated money sinkhole. Now I'm out $70 and I still need to buy my mother a birthday present.I don't know why some of these other reviewers claim it can be used to download library ebooks. Claiming that a device has a functionality that it in fact does not have, is a really despicable thing to do.If you don't mind a wireless device owning a copy of your credit card, and throwing money at it to read books, then the Barnes & Noble Nook is right for you. If you are looking for an easy to use Ereader for library ebooks, STAY AWAY!",positive
"I loved my Nook very much, Its very comfortable to use . What I  love about Nook more than kindle , that I could pick any Russian book, magazine  on Internet download on my computer , convert to PD format and download on Nook + I could pick on Nook any size of letters for comfortable reading .. On Kindle you can make bigger size of letters only if you Bought ebook on Kindle store. Other PD format books have so small size of letters , only if you zoom text , which I find uncomfortable  Like I said with Nook no problem. Also touch screen work great too.",positive
"My screen stopped working a week out of warranty.  Apparently, this is a common issue with the Nook Simple Touch.  Customer service told me that Barnes & Noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything.  This is not the way to treat customers.  I am canceling all my pre-orders and going to a different ereader.",positive
"I've owned the Nook Simple Touch for about a year now and for the most part I'm happy with it.  The rate it which the words draw on the screen is a little slow sometimes and about once a month it freezes up.  The only thing that unfreezes it is pushing the reset button for about 20 seconds.***Update*** About a month after the warranty expired, the screen froze up permanently.  I haven't been able to figure out anything that will make the touch screen work again and when I called tech support, the only advice they could give me was to do a hard reset which isn't working to unfreeze the screen anymore.  When it worked, I really liked it.  I just wish that it still worked.",positive
"Aside from various problems with this since the beginning, now I have to charge this Nook every time I want to read. It is said to hold a charge for 8 weeks with the wifi off, but even if I only read for 10 minutes, the next day I have to charge it again because the battery is too low. I've tried 3 different chargers to no avail. Instructions say to leave the Nook on when not in use, so I do. It's absolutely maddening when I return home from a stressful day of work and just want to sit on my porch to read for a while to unwind and get some cool air - but no, I have to charge the fricking Nook AGAIN and can't use it outside until it's been charged for a long time - and then have to deal with this frustration the next time I want to read.This Nook is crap and the service by Barnes & Noble and the seller were both zero - no service whatsoever, with each party passing the responsibility onto the other.Also, why is it that although the Nook screen or buttons often have to be pressed very hard to turn a page, when the Nook is closed to carry to my car or somewhere the slightest pressure changes the page or screen so I have to remember or write down what page I left off at???This Nook takes all the joy out of reading.",positive
"Bought this to replace a Sony have had for a couple years and am pleasantly surprised.Arrived on time and works beautifully.Only reason i did not give it a 5 star rating is that, for a basic ereader with WiFi, it should have had a basic browser instead of only connecting to the Nook store.",positive
"I'll be writing this review in stages, as I hit stopping points.Lightweight, nice screen, cute, low-profile buttons around the rim.  Touch screen is about as responsive as my iphone 4s.  Includes cable that has a standard USB a jack that plugs into just about everything: the computer, my hub, and the standard variety of wall worts and car chargers.This device is hard directed for ""easy setup"".  Too hard.  There should be a way to accept the TOU and get to using the device.  Forcing wifi setup and registration is just bad planning.Wifi - This is the stupidest thing about this device.  Once you charge it up, you turn it on, it asks for you to agree to terms, then it goes through wifi setup.  Note, you must HAVE wifi, AND connect to it successfully for the setup process to continue.  At this time, I'm stuck.  I'm in a town with limited wifi options, so it's not like I can just select a local hotspot.  Until i register the device, I have a brick.I have an old Netgear Router 802.11g&b; with wep and wpa protection.  The nook is capable of wpa2 security, but managed the wep and wpa security pretty nicely.  Strange thing was that I could get past the password, but it still would not connect to the internet (I checked the setup with my iPhone and everything worked fine).  Customer service had very few answers and only about 3 steps for me to take to fix the problem.  I tiered up to the supervisor and managed to pry out of her that the Nook runs on an 802.1x EAP network.  Upon googling it, this looks like the same network that causes a lot of android problems.  Next step is to hunt down a public wifi and try again.However: As soon as the thing charged and turned on, it showed up on my desktop and I was able to upload screensavers, books, documents, etc.  The device has a VERY small available memory, (about 250Mb), so text only books can be loaded, but not large PDFs (I bought this to enjoy the Modernist Cuisine series, 300Mb+ PDFs).  I had an old version of Calibre that worked right away.I'll change this review and maybe the two stars rating once I have something more than an expensive SD card reader to play with.UPDATE (after a stop at Denny's)Okay, sure enough, Once in a local restaurant with free wifi, I was able to connect, register and start using my nook.  I made sure I had a couple books on it when I left, so I was able to read a chapter before I paid the check.In good light, this screen is beautiful.  The characters are crisp and clear, it's easy to read, and you can make several screen adjustments including a limited list of fonts, size and margins.  In lower light, the dark grey on light grey screen gets tougher to read than, say, a printed sheet of paper.  Still, in my apt with only a 60 watt light illuminating the room, it's still pretty easy to read.You get two choices on how the side buttons function.  Personally, I like the lower one turning the page forward; because I tend to hold it in the lower corner, cupped in my hand.  However, you can swipe the screen to turn pages, too.The OS on the nook is a little simpler than, say the kindle fire.  And maybe that's why I like it better.  On this device, books are books are books.  They can be epubs, pdfs, purchased or uploaded, they all go the same place, and they all end up in the same list.  Nothing grinds my gears more than having to look 2-3 places for things based on where you bought them, or some other phantom difference established by the designers (or worse, the marketing department - I'm looking at you Kindle).  The down side to this that if you have a large ebook library, you are pretty much stuck using the search function.  There doesn't seem to be a way to organize books any other way. [checking online....] Oh crap, they have this whole ""shelf"" system built in.  Damn, scratch that organizational thing, I'll get back to ya there.Screen Savers.Forget about those fancy things on your PC, the nook's idea of a screen saver is to place a picture on the screen when it sleeps.  The default is a bunch of pictures of famous authors.  nice, you can also choose nature scenes.  But, remember I said that you could upload directly to the nook?  Well, here ya go. Create a folder with the name of your screen saver set, upload some 800x600 pics (jpg/png formats) in portrait mode and Voila! You have your own custom set.  I went to nook.com and downloaded a bunch of Str Trek Geeky stuff at first, but then realized I could just take a few snapshots and convert them to 16 greys myself.  Now I have a folder of a dozen of MY pictures as the screen saver.  Very nice.  Kinda like having an image viewer as well.Calibre.Getting calibre to work with the device once it was working was a complete breeze.  I bought a 16gb micro SD on sale and added it.  The card mounts on the desktop separately, but calibre is all tuned up to read them correctly.  So, when you put stuff on the device, you have the option of loading it in main memory or on the card.  Come to think of it, a series of small cards could be another way to organize as well.  Put your SF collection on this card, classics on that one, etc.  Fun.Oh, also, once I got the registration completed at Denny's I went into settings and disconnected the wifi.  It's been operating in that mode ever since.  So, only that first time is needed.Adding two more stars for all the juicy goodness.  I'll play around with it a while and see if we can get it to 5.  No real serious problems yet.UpdatePDFs - Okay, so pretty much everything else that displays pdfs tries to incorporate the formatting of the document.  This strange little device actually reads the text (easiest way to save formatting = text + format), and produces it in standard format.  It's a little disorienting but it makes for a much more consistent reading experience.Micro SDI think my real problem with this device was getting a huge SD card for this then thinking I had to fill it with a whole library.  Bah!  Granted, those 6 really large PDFs need some room, but I could have fit them all on a 2 Gb card and still had plenty of room to spare.  *sigh*  All that room meant I could have 100s of books on the device.  Think: Tim Taylor "" More Power!"" {grunt grunt}Shelves.  The device keeps track of the shelves internally, so it's not like a document you could edit outside the device and use your computer's search function to organize.  you MUST go through your entire library, no search functions, one book at a time to add to shelves.  Great if you know what you're looking for, but not all sets start with Lord of the Rings 1: ....If you buy this, don't get an external card right away.  the onboard memory can hold a lot of stuff.  Shorter onboard lists mean you have less stress with shelves and such.I won't be exploring the B&N; store for a while (a Long while).  I have a massive library to work through first.  So look elsewhere for those reviews.  I've heard the store is mighty nice though.No ads, easy to use, a joy to read.  This, my final entry sees that last star moving up the device.  Take heed of the speedbumps I've experienced and enjoy this cute little reader.  Now, I just need a case.....  :)ANOTHER UPDATE: Months later and I've read a small library on this thing.  It's a delight.  but I still find myself avoiding PDFs a lot because of the disorientation.  Also: to the 2 people who did NOT find this review helpful - Bite me.  Leave a comment.",positive
I bought this directly from barns and noble. I get books from the library on my computer and that works good. The battery life is very good and the screen is very responsive. This is better then the kindle because it has expandable memory and accepts all popular formats for eBooks. The one complaint I have is that when you read PDFs you do not get the dictionary features and some of the writing is weirdly spaced. That's not what I bought it for so it does not matter to me. It has survived many months in public high school so it is very durable. I have of course bought it a protective case though. Barns and Noble ebooks are cheaper then regular books by a couple of dollars.,positive
"MORE UPDATES at the bottom of my review!My review includes details of Kindle 3, the newest version! With the time period, I could still return my nook, but I'm still completely in love with it and don't want the kindle for the reasons below.I was one of those people who was averse to the idea of an e-reader for a long time. I liked the feel of a real book, I was in love with free books at the library, why would I start paying for them? Then, my library got ""overdrive"", which is e-books FREE from the library. Then one day soon after, I woke up and the urge for an e-reader was there. The Nook was my final choice. It took a lot of back and forth and research to get to this point. I bought and tried the Sony Touch reader, returned it, and went and got the Nook. I really honestly wanted the Kindle most, because I'm a loyalist. I love Amazon and felt really comfortable here if I decided to actually start purchasing books again. But below, I'll give you comparisons to the three big readers and the reasons I got the nook:- Nook(N) by barnes & noble- Kindle 3(K) by amazon.com- Sony Reader Touch(ST)1. My biggest decision maker was Epub. This is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library, so I needed whatever I got to be Epub friendly.N: The Nook is epub friendly. As well as PDF, and many other formats.K: The Kindle won't use Epub, which was all I needed to know. It mainly uses it's own Amazon format,while it also uses PDF, mobi and a few others. It makes me feel like Amazon is being greedy, wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site. Don't they understand that I love my library?ST: Sony reader is Epub friendly. pretty much the same as the nook.2. PRICE!N: 149 with wifiST: 169 NO WIFIK: 139 with wifi(or 189 with wifi and free 3G)While kindle 3 is 10 dollars cheaper, it doesn't give me those free library books, so it really doesn't make any difference to me.*You can now lend some books from the Nook for 14 days to a friend with their new ""lend me"" technology. While this is in beta stages, and not ALL books are lendable. It depends on the agreement with the publisher. The other two you cannot lend at all.*The Nook has a replaceable, rechargable battery. So it'll last awhile, but when its dwindling, you can spend 30 bucks and put a new one in yourself. For the Kindles, they are sealed inside. People have said you can do it yourself, but you must be tech savvy. Or you can send it away to Amazon for about the cost of [...]+shipping charges and they'll replace it for you.*You can expand your memory on the Nook and on the Sony touch. The Kindle you cannot, though the Kindle will hold 3,500 books, don't know if you need more space then that?!*Nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom. While the Sony touch has a touch screen(the entire screen), it was slow to respond, very klunky and not very pretty. The kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen.* all three have a built in dictionary, which I think is just awesome.*The new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width. People used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width, now the kindle will be as well.*Yet, the Nook is heavier by about 3 oz then the Kindle or Sony.*The Nook battery life lasts about 10 days with wifi off, the Sony has 14 days, and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off(3 weeks with it on)This wasn't a big deal to me, and I was more interested in the other features the Nook DID have, like replaceable battery and expandable memory.*And you may be wondering, why did I purchase a Sony Touch, and then scamper back hours later to return it? Well. When I got it out of the box, it wasn't techy enough for me. It felt like a very basic, bare bones E-reader. And I already had in my head all the things you hear about the nook: books more expensive, and for some reason I thought it wasn't epub friendly. But the moment I had that Sony in my hand, I went to look at the nook more indepth online. The Sony online library was nothing in comparison to Kindle's Amazon.com or Nook's Barnes & Noble. One of my favorite reads recently was The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It was nowhere to be found on Sony. That gave me a bad taste in my mouth.*In the past people have complained that Barnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon. I did some price comparisons of big titles, and found them most of the time to be exactly the same. I think Barnes & Noble might be trying to keep in line with Amazon to draw more readers(Like ME!) into getting the Nook.On the whole, the nook is everything I wanted. I've downloaded some free classics from google books, I've taken out library ebooks and it was REALLY easy! I even bought my first book(well, ebook) in a long time. Despite being a new release, it was under ten bucks. I also bought another book I've been meaning to read for years for under four dollars. The nook is comfortable to hold with one hand. I like the using the touch screen to ""swipe"" and turn pages. And tops on my list, I didn't feel horrificly guilty for buying it. One fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book reader.Update Oct '10: A software update is coming in Nov:""dramatically increase page turn speed, customized B&N; Library organization and password protection. It also includes the ability to sync across all NOOK and all devices enabled with our free NOOK apps, by syncing your last page read. If you forget your NOOK at home, use the NOOK app for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Android smartphone or PC to pick up where you left off. And, the next time you pick up your NOOK, the Reading Now page will be updated and ready to go.Update Dec '10: The update was a pinch to install, and it has some stellar perks that make the nook even more loveable. The shelving option it a lot of fun for those people who like to organize. You can name a shelf anything you want. The only limit is your Barnes and Noble book will stay in their Barnes folder, while any other books you have will stay in My Documents. The page turn is very fast. I do read across multiple devices, but for most people that will be a great new feature.",positive
"I absolutely love it. While it doesn't have the bells and whistles of the other Ebook Readers, it does exactly what it is meant to do. It allows you to read books. I bought this as gateway into ebook technology and I love it. The unit fits into your hands nicely and is not heavy. The buttons on the side are helpful in turning the pages. It charges fast and the battery lasts a decent amount of time.",positive
I waited until June 2010 until I bought a nook. So far I am loving it. I love the page turning swipe feature. Those that gave the nook 1 star are the ones who got theirs with the 1.1 firmware. The firmware is now up to 1.4 and the price has dropped to $199.,positive
"UPDATE 6/3/10:  B&N; is offering a $50 gift card with every purchase from June 2 =>.  They will honor purchases up to two weeks prior to the launch of the promotion.  I bought mine 5/22 and my gift card arrives in 10 business days!  Now that's what I call a customer-focused company with excellent customer service.  Another and very important reason why nook beats Kindle.nook review:I did my research on e-readers and thought long and hard about the two main contenders - nook and Kindle.  I chose the nook.  Why?...1) It's design is future-proof (as far as anything is) because the hardware is designed such that software and firmware updates can make it more functional in the future.  Kindle requires new hardware. I just read a new one will be out in August '10, and no, no touch screen!2) Amazon (Kindle) is not a dedicated book store whose sole livelihood is books, like B&N; (nook).  Amazon has demonstrated this with its wrangling with publishers to the dismay of both the publishers and Amazon's customers3) Yes, the nook was rushed out last year but they are now already on V1.3 software, but it works well and has added features and corrected some early flaws.  The page turns are now quicker and very acceptable, especially compared with a real book page turn.  Whoever you are with, they will have some problems and features you do or don't like.  There are supposedly more books via B&N;, but never the books you actually want to read - Kindle has some missing for me as well as B&N.;B&N; will no doubt keep updating its software regularly and Amazon make you pay for new Kindles (and risk you not being able to read your e-books on the next version, like V1 to V2)E-book pricing is a little crazy right now as publishers seem to be trying to establish the ""value"" of e-books versus paperback/hardcover.  Some e-books are more expensive and some are changing prices weekly.  It's the same situation with both Kindle and nook from what I can tell.4) The touch screen is a nice feature (future-proofed hardware), but big fingers can hit the wrong selection occasionally.  It is comparable with the iTouch touchscreen performance IMHO.  Navigation is maybe more hassle than the Kindle as a result.  This also makes the nook smaller (no physical keyboard to worry about) and easier to hold, even though it is marginally heavier than the Kindle.5) The nook can be personalized with your own photos for wallpaper and screen-savers (wrong wording as it's just a picture for when the nook is in sleep mode - No burn-in with e-ink screens). You can add more storage in a nook with a micro SD card6) The Kindle battery lasts longer, but the nook is fine with the Wi-Fi turned off - about 10 hours.  The nook battery is user-replaceable and costs just $29, unlike the Kindle7) The nook extended warranty covers ANY accidental breakage/spillage for the full 2 years.8) A B&N; store is always nearby to get help in person and they currently offer a free book per week when you visit the store (in week 2 of 5 right now)9) Using independent free software available on the web (Calibre), I can convert and ""sideload"" documents and news feeds to my nook.  I have sideloaded web pages (originally saved as HTML), word documents and .pdf's, all in .epub format.  This is no doubt possible with Kindle too, but the nook is more than flexible for my needs.  I read USA Today and The BBC news feeds on my nook every day and they include B&W; photos and diagrams which are clearly readable.  Calibre has many more available.10) Using Sigil, again free software, I can modify e-books to add chapters or correct errors and sideload them to my nook.  Again, no doubt a possibility with Kindle, but I am not sure.11)  Nook is just the one size, no Kindle DX equivalent.  For my needs though, the small nook is ""back pocket"" sized (literally fitting in my back pocket) and is small enough to read but carry around.  I need reading glasses without exception to read and so can read at the smallest text size with no problem.12)  I'm not bothered about having a music player and the built-in speakers are not really capable as listening devices (tinny and low volume), but it's there and will no doubt allow for text-to-speech in a future software release, which will be useful.  The sound quality through headphones is good.I've had my nook a week and have read two books and many daily news articles.  It's comfortable to use, it's fun to use and while maybe a luxury we could all do without, I've read a couple free e-books that otherwise, I would never have done - and I have many more downloaded and ready in the wings.  It's actually now a hassle to read through a real paperback or hardcover.  :-)The choice is yours, but my choice was the nook and I think it was a good choice.UPDATE 6/2/10 - .PDF's on the nookI have found that .pdf books, especially with charts and diagrams (ie technical/text books) are problematic to read on the nook.  Interestingly the B&N; store personnel stated that they had never tried to read a .pdf on the nook - maybe just a way to avoid the issue??  However, the Kindle will no doubt have the same issue, unless you use the DX which is larger and so you can read .pdf's natively.If you read a native .pdf on the nook it is the whole page squeezed down to the 5"" screen - impossible to read.  If you use Calibre to convert the .pdf to .epub format, then the end result is variable.  Diagrams get screwed up or disappear and while text can be enlarged with the font size function, even the text formatting may or may not be acceptable.Either way, I have given up trying to read such books on my nook.  :-(I would not recommend the nook to anyone trying to use it for school where .pdf's are the only format available.  The problem is not nook/Kindle, but the way .pdf's are created.  They don't have the necessary information encoded to be able to convert them to other e-reader formats and retain their .pdf look.  If you are going to save any documents for conversion to .epub format, don't use .pdf.  I have found saving as .HTML renders a perfectly acceptable .epub file when converted, including diagrams and charts when archiving web pages, for example.See also my review of the JAVOedge Snake Skin Case for Barnes & Nobles Nook (Flip Style)",positive
"MY WIFE ADORES THIS PRODUCT !!It was our household's first e-reader.There IS a little learning curve at first and expect to need a household pc to talk to it via a usb micro (not MINI) data cable WITH DATA capability (some usb cables are just charge-only) and if you get a used deal on one without a usb micro data+power ability, you are looking at up to $20.00 (unless you get one cheaper taking a risk on a crappier cable).---Only thing is it's hard for someone whose disabled with touching or vision issues to use... though you can increase font size, the rare occasion you have to type something out it's kinda small but that doesn't happen often on the nook itself.----She uses hers mainly to check things out from the Clark County Library District in Las Vegas.  Once we registered with the Library, we installed Adobe Digital Editions which is the digital rights management... that took some doing but once in place, you tell the ADE of the nook you have, authorize it, and then from that point on anytime you want to check out a library book you simply go to their site, check out the electronic version which comes into your computer where the ADE recognizes it and outputs it to your nook.After x amount of days...when the checkout time expires, the file disables itself and you either get another book from the library or re check-in/check-out the same one for another x days.It makes the public library a whole new experience and that's great because, guess what...your tax dollars paid for it !  and the author gets their cut too.....Win-win all around....We've never bought an e-book from barnes and noble yet, and you do have to register the nook with them at first though you don't have to put in a credit card, but that step is probably skippable it's just handy because if you want help from b&n; they'll want you to at least register the product with them..not a big deal and it's one-time during your initial set-up procedures (and that's the one time you need to use the aforementioned little hard to type on 'typewriter' display.Happy Nooking(P.S.  as a bad pun, I told my wife that if The 3 Stooges owned it, it would be a Nook-Nook-Nook... but I was frowned at.  Guess it's funnier if Curley is your favorite stooge.  I digress :)  )",positive
"This is the most fantastic device imaginable. It has traveled to England, Scotland, Turkey, Egypt and Qatar and has even taken a cruise! It has traveled around in a purse, a briefcase and a carryon. It has downloaded books in PDF as well as the e-pub format, from Barnes & Noble as well as other suppliers. It has borrowed and loaned books. It also gets automatic software updates and even accesses the web to check e-mail or the latest news. This is one device that will never disappoint.So easy to read. A big plus is that when you search for a subject on B&N;, once it has exhausted the B&N; offerings (some free!), it goes on to list all the Google Books in the same category. If you make selections of Google books those are downloaded exactly the same as paid selections. I love the way this all happens automatically. You don't have to do anything at all. You can also add audio books, other audio files. The approximately 1,500 book capacity plus the capability of adding more storage is another real plus.",positive
"I bought a Nook during one of my visits to Tampa, more specifically at the Wiregrass Shops. I must admit that I was tremendously excited when I got the device, because of the reviews and also the SD card capability.My joy was short lived. During the 2 weeks that I owned the product I was never able once to open none of my sideloaded pdf's that I have amassed over the years (over 30GB - I am a voracious reader). A long string of calls to Customer Service and the shop itself ensued, after which I decided to take the trip again (I live outside of the USA) to return the device directly to the store.Much to my surprise, they were extremely receptive at the store and also very apologetic for the device's inability to function properly outside the States and also the lack of functionality and propietary issues. I was refunded for all the items (Nook, cover case and screen protector) in no time at all.So, in summary, the Nook gets a ZERO star in my review for paying more attention to the esthetics rather than the functionality of the reader, but B&N; gets a FIVE star rating for their approachability and for their great costumer service!",positive
"So, I bought the nook a few weeks ago when the price cut went into action and was constantly going back and forth with the thoughts of buying this, or buying the kindle.I bought the device with 3G simply because it was only a little more, and I travel a lot and don't have house wi-fi. I remember when I used to scoff at the nook when walking into B&N; and can't believe I ever did that! I love the feel of being able to go into the bookstore, with my nook and feel connected to the actual store. I will admit you have to do your research (read forums, articles etc...) because the nook demo employees, are not going to know everything. Also you MUST read the 'manual' and follow it to a 'T' Don't take the reader out of the box and drain what little battery you have left because you're going to have battery issues (needing it to drain completely a few times and then fully charging it before the battery is at full capacity)A lot of people may think their nook is 'frozen' when actually the battery is drained, and when that happens the screen is set to whatever screen saver, book page etc you were on when it died. There's no 'power-down' it will just stop, and touchscreen will not be active, once you plug it up and charge it a little, it will be good again. Also the constant use of the touchscreen will drain the unit faster (obvious unfortunate fact)There are a lot of books available at the moment (depending what genre you read) especially for teen and sci-fi and fiction (my books), and I was surprised to see all of the 'lend me features' for a good portion of the books I was interested in. Also B&N; really listens to complaints and proves that with upgrades (faster page turning, less freezing etc.)Also even when there was a manufacturing error, they were quick to send out a new improved nook. Overall, I love this device, it's fun, its sleek with a solid feel, and it's open-ended for future updates.It may be for you, it may not. Do your research, read forums and reviews, go into the respective stores and hold and try the device.Pros:Removable/replaceable batteryReally crisp 'paper' and 'words'e-wish list for booksSD card slotAudio/ musicFree coupons, discounts, and food monthly via nooke pub librarygetting books from Sony ADELending featureConsBattery lasts an average of 7-8 daystouchscreen keyboard a bit small (if you're used to iphone/ipod)touchscreen may be over sensitive with accidental touchSmall price differences with kindle books (average of a dollar)",positive
"After what I thought was a thorough research between the Kindle, nook & Sony ereaders, I took the plunge & bought the nook. What appealled to me most were the web browser & ePub use to check out books from the library. However, after fully charging the nook, I took it with me for a weekend at the beach. I didn't bring the the charger because B&N; said battery would last up to 10 days with wireless off. Well, I found out the hard way, with wireless on, it barely a couple hours reading at night & in the afternoon by the beach. Oy, was I frustrated with nothing left to read & another night & afternoon left. Lesson learned: must bring charger everywhere! Lost 1 * for this.I'm not a fan of touch screens, still love my trusty push-button cellphone. So browsing the web was a pain for me, having to navigate around the screen with my finger. Page turning was fine, but I think I've overdone it since my finger began stinging from constant page-turning friction :0)). Scrolling down & up also frustrates me - most of the time I have to swipe several times to get it to move. Not to mention hitting the back button after book downloads - the response time was slow which made me think it didn't sense my touch, so I'd do it again & it goes back all the way to the main menu. Grrr! What a pain as I have to restart the store search & find the page again.B&N; samples are horrible! They give you 7 pages...but it's the cover, copyright, dedication page with only a paragraph of the actual story. Not enough to make me want to buy a book. The closest B&N; is 1 hour drive away so I couldn't take advantage of the cafe freebies or free reading in-store.After I discovered that I cannot organize books into folders, that was the final straw. I read novels with racy titles, my 10 y.o. son wanted to read his classics on the nook but I didn't want to lend it to him because he would see all my books & potentially read them. This is a biggie for me so lost another *.Features I'm happy with: I was able to check-out books from my library & I was able to put my pdf books on the nook. Yey! Unfortunately, my library just got into ebooks & have only a handfull of books so it'll be a while until I can fully take advantage of this feature.Well, these are my personal experiences with which I now realize that I didn't do a thorough reasearch as I first thought, LOL. My fault...but I still like my nook, though I'm no longer in love with it like when I first received it. I've also ordered the latest Kindle so we'll see which one I'll keep - I'm looking forward to the push-button keys on that, LOL.",positive
".Paid $[...] for this in April 2010.  Biggest waste of money I ever spent.  not worth the hassle of getting it repaired.  Made me miserable and unhappy for three days.  This is not how I want to spend my life--feeling miserable and abused and wondering how I got suckered into this huge mistake.The good--or perhaps the OK--I found nothing really good.GSM service is free for purchasing books and most uses. Not all that valuable.  I'd be happy with just WiFi and enough memory to carry around a personal library. with me.  GSM available for anything else but books.  Wifi works ok, after some fussing with the settings.  Many times I got error messages.  I kept trying until it worked.  There is some issue with the Wifi but it can be fussed with until it works--starting and stopping it.The bad--just about everything:I travel a lot, and need to carry my library with me.  This device does not work to download books outside of the US.  Why not?  I can understand the GSM not working, but if I have WiFi access somewhere, I should be able to load anything I want anywhere.  I can load books anywhere with my iPod Touch. Requires a US address.  Why?  Why can't anyone use it?  Device requires that you sign up with B&N; with a credit card.  Why can't I download free books without a B&N; account?  You cannot use this device until it is registered.This device is barely functional.  The interface is poorly designed, B&N; does a great job of making it difficult to find free books, and the books that are normally free--B&N; charges you $1 to $2 for these books! Outrageous!  Most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domain.The interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional.  Do a GOOGLE search for nook soft root--better yet check out YouTube and search for TROOK.Do a search on nook itself for free and you won't find free books, you will find books with ""free"" in the title or crippled editions with two chapters free.  There is no menu selection for find free books.  If you do find a free book it will be after wading through page after page of the same title--it would take days to find even a few interesting free books.  With the Kindle, at least you get to choose a few best sellers are part of your purchase price.  The B&N; give you nothing for free but garbage.  They want to frustrated enough to pay them more money for overpriced books.  Personally I can't see paying the same price for an electronic book as I do a paper bound book that I can resell or give as a gift.  Electronic books cost nothing to produce and distribute--why do they cost so much?  It is gouging, IMHO.To get a free book into your nook is a nightmare PITA.  I use an iPod Touch and was able to load 60 free books into it, in about 8 minutes--easy and simple.  Not menu after menu and then find out the book was not loaded after all.With B&N; nook it takes a long time to select and load a book.  You have to pay for a book, even if it is zero dollars--another menu choice, just to get you in the habit of hitting a purchase button.  There are lots of free books out there.  Why should it be hard to load these? Personally, I want a large library with me because I travel alot, and I want to find  what I want quickly, and I want to read it without hassle.PFD files can be loaded but these are not re-sized, so that type is pretty small and hard to read.  I can't read them, and I have reasonably good near vision.  If you are young with perfect vision you might be able to read for a while until your eyes get tired.  PDF don't work well on this device.Changing a page is a pain with the controls.  There is a way to use a finger swipe that some people have difficulty with.I personally hate wading through 40-60 pages on the life of the author, at the beginning of the book when all I want to do is read the book itself.  Books with a ton of crap in the front, with articles about the life of the author, acknowledgments, are a PITA toget around.  Scrolling down to chapter one to start the book is problematic--sometimes you are sent back to the index, other times you go to Chapter one. Why should I have to scroll and enter a command twice.  Why can't it work the first time?I constantly had the urge to use the white part of the device as a touch screen, but only the bottom is a touch screen.  I found myself thinking, my iPod Touch is better than this.  It is fast to touch what I want.  Give me something better like a Blackberry pointer ball!Display is flashing every time a page is changed.  I found this constantly annoying.  Why?  There is no reason for the flashing.  EVERY PAGE FLASHES AT YOU!  YOU WILL LEARN TO HATE IT!!!!USB power connector.  This is a weak spot of the device.  Instead of using a robust connector, they use a micro USB connector. It is wobbly. Even a mini-USB would have been better.  At times I  could not make this connector work.  It is delicate.  It doesn't want to mate up.  I found I needed to be very precise on aligning it, even then it would not connect.  I doubt that this will survive 100 re-connections.  If you buy this device, do not expect it to last more than two years.  It would be smart to get the extended warrantee--another $60 for two years--If you buy a nook.  Charge it only when you have too, or you will wear out this connector in a short period of time.  While the battery life is good, given the crappy connector, I don't understand why they didn't put a battery 2-3 times larger in this device so that the connector would last longer and have less wear.Memory Storage is limited to about 1GB with space to add another memory card.  To bring it up to 8 or 16 GB, it will cost you another $30 to $60, or if you buy it from B&N; it will be twice as much.  I feel the device is worthless without at least another 8GB of storage.  I'd rather it came with another 16GB.  The iPad comes with that much or more--so you get a color full touch screen for not much more than the cost of the memory you need.This is a good gift for someone clueless about electronics that won't know any better about how badly B&N; crippled their android operating system and don't understand what a good interface is all about.Do yourself a favor.  Try an iPod Touch, and I assume the iPad works as well.  Apple makes quality products that work right, with strong connectors, great software, and are backed up with the highest rated customer support.  B&N; built something with one purpose only, to sell electronic books--and to make it difficult to find free books, and to break quickly.  If you want to be screwwed over, buy one of these and then bend over because B&N; sees you as someone to be used and abused--not a valuable customer.If B&N; made it easy to download free books, I'd be more forgiving on the crappy software they use and the delicate power connector.  If B&N; made a decent, usable interface, and made it easy to load whole library's of free books, I'd probably buy some electronic books and they would earn my business.  As it is, I will never buy an e-Book or any other book from B&N.;  That is how angry I am about wasting money on this product.My nook is dead after only three days.  I wish I could return it.  I don't have the original packaging either, so that even if I got a new replacement, I cannot sell it on eBay to get my money back.  I'm not sure what I'll do.  I will be calling B&N; tomorrow to see about a replacement, and begging for a store credit instead so I can buy an iPad instead.The bottom line is, I'm more than disappointed about the product.  I'm angry enough that I'll never do business with B&N; again--even if they refund me the price of this device.  I don't even want it back if it were repaired.I'd rather pay $600 for an iPad, purchasing from a company that charges a lot for products that are well thought out and work well.  While I may wish the price was less for Apple products, at least I don't have this awful feeling of being screwwed ten different ways by B&N; with their service and nook product.For those who think this is a good product.  You are fools who don't know enough to make a valid judgment.  I laugh at you, because your nook will be dead within a year.",positive
"After reading many technical and customer reviews of both the Nook and the Kindle, I purchased the Nook.  I think that both the Nook and Kindle are good products, but the Nook offers the user some unique advantages over its counterpart--the Kindle. First, a buyer can actually test drive the Nook before purchasing it at either Best Buy or at a Barnes and Noble store. The Kindle is only available on line at Amazon.com.  I cannot invest my hard earned money into buying an electronic device without trying it out first. The physical design of the Nook is attractive, sturdy, and compact. Navigating is easy. The user does not have to use the left/right arrows on the Nook to turn the page of an ebook.  The pages of a book can be easily turned by simply swiping the touch screen. Bookmarks can also be set. This is an important feature for me since I tend to read more than one book at a time. Secondly, the Nook offers web browsing.  I was able to link my Nook to my home wireless network and surf web pages.  Although the software is still in its beta stages, I am impressed at what I can already do.  Next, I can download and/or design wallpapers and screensavers for the Nook. This might be a minor point, but it makes the Nook unique and customizable for its owner. The Nook's storage capacity can be expanded. The Nook comes with 2GB of storage that the user can expand up to 16GB by purchasing and installing a micro SD card. The Nook's internal battery lasts about five years with normal use (this is according to technical reviewers), and a replacement battery can be purchased and installed by the user. Nook users also have a community forum they can join on the Barnes and Noble website to share ideas, tips, and news about the Nook. Also, improvements in the Nook software updates are due to customer input. I like for my suggestions to be heard and the Nook engineering team is listening. Don't take my word for it. Test drive the Nook for yourself before you make a decision.",positive
"I'll admit up front that when I chose the Nook over Kindle and Sony's e-reader, I was impressed by that nifty full color touchscreen at the bottom of reading screen.  Glitz does not equal function, as I promptly found out.To be fair to Nook, if ALL you want to do is read, the device works, and works pleasantly.  I received my Nook in February, so it had the latest firmware updates, and I experienced none of the delays in downloading, missed sections of books, delays in page turning that early reports noted.  But if I was attempting to do anything more than clicking the page turning buttons, OUCH!The nifty little full color touchscreen (NOT to be confused with the e-paper reading screen, which is permanently gray-scale) just can't do it's job.  It responds slowly and inconsistently to touch, is quirky in its response, and virtually (no pun intended) unusable.  The virtual keyboard:  what a nightmare.  It's a true challenge to type more than one or two words without making an error, and trying to fix that error degenerates into a tragi-comedy in short order.The unit itself is pleasant to the hand, and comfortable.  It's also darn slick in its appearance, and if aesthetics  are your only criteria, well, go for it.  But here is why I returned the Nook after one week:  any optional feature, such as bookmarking, highlighting text and annotating it, search functions for previous book marks and annotations:  purely a nightmare.  The processor of the Nook appears to be vastly underpowered, and each instruction you give the touchscreen results in a wait that seems interminable.  It took me 30 seconds, AFTER I got good at it, to highlight 3 lines at the bottom of a page.  Simply not acceptable.Battery life:  might have just been my own unit, but in 7 hours: dead.  I also experienced two full scale lockups, with all buttons simply refusing to work for several minutes.The Nook's only advantage, as far as I can tell, is access to significantly more free content than you can currently access on Kindle.  Not worth the incredible frustration of wrestling with a device that went for touchscreen technology, but forgot that the touchscreen needs to be FUNCTIONAL before you bring it to market.Update as of 2/11/2010:  I purchased a Kindle after returning my Nook, and have been using it for three days.  Wow.  What an incredible difference in terms of ease of use.  The keyboard is very functional, bookmarking and note taking is effortless, the dictionary function (move the cursor to a word, instantly a definition pops up) is wonderful. Battery consumption is imperceptible, after 3 day, no visible drain (my Nook lasted 7 hours).  Downside of the Kindle?  Books whose copyright had expired (e.g. Wuthering Heights)that were FREE on Nook, are 99 cents on Kindle.  Nook lists all vendors of a given book, with prices conveniently visible, Kindle does not.  Irritating.  Lastly, Nook had a tiny clock in a corner of the screen, which I found very useful.  Not available on Kindle.  Overall:  for my needs, no contest whatsoever: Kindle",positive
"I did a lot of research on the different ebook Readers before purchasing my NOOK.  I went back and forth between Amazon's Kindle and B&N's NOOK.  The thing that sold me on the NOOK was the ability to download books from other sources than just Amazon.  I can download books from my local library, Google Books, along with Barnes & Noble's selection of over 2 million books they offer.  The ability to download any ePub and PDF files is a plus.  I like the touch pad vs. keyboard on Kindle.  It took a little getting used to as it is very touch sensitive, but once I got the hang of it, it is a smooth way to navigate.  One of the criticisms of NOOK has been some sluggishness with the NOOK, which I have maybe a tiny bit of, but we're talking maybe a second or so, so it is no big deal really.  There have been many criticisms about the battery life of the NOOK, but to me it's a minor thing as all I have to do is plug it in about every 4 or 5 days if I use my NOOK excessively.  It lasts longer if the WiFi is turned off.  I can go a week without having to recharge it then.  I also like the ability to replace the battery myself rather than having to send the the entire Kindle in to have it replaced.  One of the nicest features of the NOOK is being able to go into my local B&N bookstore and talking to a real live person if I have any questions or have any problem with my NOOK.  B&N has NOOK stations right in their stores with people who are there to answer questions or help with problems you may encounter.  They are very helpful.  The Kindle does not offer that kind of service.  All in all I am very happy with my NOOK and would recommend one to anyone looking for an ebook Reader.",positive
"Despite all of the negative reviews, I decided to take a chance and buy the nook, once I tested it out at my local B&N.; I loved the look and feel of this device and was looking forward to the convenience of buying more books without adding more clutter to my already cluttered bookcases. I read all of the pros and cons of owning a Kindle and compared it to the pros and cons of owning a nook. The nook won because of its versatility (epub format, book lending, etc).My nook arrived on January 28th. Since then, I've experienced one crash and had to figure out how to use the touchscreen so that I can flip the pages without having to use the arrow keys. The latter took some practice, but I eventually mastered it and have been enjoying this feature ever since. I've also read three books in the space of a week, which is a personal record for me, as it normally takes two weeks for me to read a single paperback, longer if I'm reading an ebook on an LCD screen.The eInk technology is fabulous. I can read all day (and do) without eyestrain. The letters are very crisp on a plain white background. Even better, you can adjust the font size from small to extra large. Not only that but the nook comes with several fonts: Amasis, Helvetica Neue and Light Classic. I'm happy with the Amasis as it resembles Times Roman.My only complaint so far is that I am not able to categorize my books into categories. At the moment, I'm forced to wade through my list until I find the book that I want to read. B&N; has already sent out an update, which is a good improvement over the old interface. While the touch interface can be a bit buggy (Sometimes you have to flick your finger more than once or use the arrow keys to turn the page.), I can turn pages in one second compared to the 2-3 seconds it would take with the original software. That wasn't a big deal until I received the upgrade.I also like what they've done with the bookmarks feature. Before, they had a strange numerical format for bookmarks. With this upgrade, it lists the page that you bookmarked, which is much nicer.I love how I can download samples of ebooks directly from my nook without having to rely on the B&N; site to do everything. Once you finish the sample, you have the option to buy. If you decide to buy the book, you will be taken to the last page you read so that you can continue from there. You can also archive the books that you've read directly from your nook with the press of a button, which helps manage your list.Sideloading my pdf ebooks onto my nook was an easy experience. However, you can't categorize your documents; you can only sort them by title or author.Another great aspect of owning a nook is that you can check out ebooks from your local libraries (see [...] for a list of libraries near you), sideload books that you have bought from Fictionwise and other ebook stores, and download free ebooks from either the B&N; site or Google Books. That's what ultimately sold me on the nook, the versatility and freedom to choose where I want to buy or download free ebooks. The nook is not proprietary, unlike the Kindle and the soon-to-be-released iPad.The interface is very easy to use. It comes with a manual that you can read on the device, or on the B&N; website. If you're still stuck on an issue, I found this great forum ([...]) with friendly people who can help you.I've yet to check out the Lend feature because my family and friends have yet to embrace this technology.Other than my issue with organization, I am really enjoying my nook. I'm looking forward to reading many books in the future, thanks to this wonderful device. Highly recommended.Side note: I agree with S. Dayton about the iPad. After reading a few ebooks on my iTouch and my Mac, I have to agree with him about the eyestrain. For casual surfing and watching video, LCD works fine. But for longterm reading, eInk is the way to go.",positive
"I've researched the readers for about two years.I only buy electronics after I can give the item a test drive. Upon that note, I have always been a huge fan of Amazon.For the first time I could not go to a store and compare prices and see the item in question.The nook was available to be put through anything I wanted to try. First of all the new Nook in stores has the most recent upgrades. No problem with turning the page at all,touch screen worked great. In the store I downdoaded a book in under 1 minute and have downloaded 3 books at home that are nearly 1000 pages long in under 1 minute.The nook can connect to your computer (as does the Sony). You can also download from other sources other than the dealer.The nook also downloads without any effort wi-fi ( as does the Kindle).The nook's battery you can change at home. It also accepts a memory card, which allows you to expand your book collection.The Nook also has other advantages,but I was only wanted a reliable reader.Barnes and Noble has a home run with the nook because it combined the features of the sony and the kindle in one very neat package.",positive
"After MONTHS of research for my first ereader I finally decided on the Nook. With all the buzz, I, of course, ran out to BN to see the Nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and I had almost crossed it off my list for purchase. However, I went back and saw it again at the store after about 6 weeks from my first viewing and what a difference! Barnes and Noble has made great strides. A friend showed me her Kindle and I got to play with it and I looked in stores and saw the Sony reader as well. Did MUCH research online as well on some of the others such as Jetbook Lite.As much as I LOVE Amazon and shop here more often than I probably should LOL. I decided on the Nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time. What sealed the deal for me was the SD card option to expand memory AND you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery change.I am not regretting my decision to go with the Nook at all. I have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice, BUT it only did that when I interrupted the charging process. So, I don't know exactly what caused that. No problems at all while reading. As far as reading on the Nook, its a great device. Downloading books is fast and simple to do. Page turning is fast now. Its a dream come true for an avid reader like me.The only con that I've noticed so far is battery life. I think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts 10 days. However, the wi-fi turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so, so you don't have to manually turn it off. When you activate the menu, it will reconnect to the network. So, BN is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interaction.I highly recommend the Nook. With BN updates coming as quick as they are, I think this device is proving to be THE superior ereader.",positive
"I purchased a Kindle for my wife last Christmas. She loves it and uses it more than any other gift I ever purchased her. She was having so much fun with it I decided to get an ereader for myself but I was drawn more toward the Nook. I read so many bad reviews about the Nook I wasn't sure if I should get it or a Kindle or maybe something different with a touch screen and wireless connection. I thought about it for a few weeks and noticed that the reviews started getting better. I decided to go for it. I ordered it last Wednesday from B&N; and received it 2 days later. I am so happy I did. I didn't experience any of the the negatives I read about with exception that battery could stay charged longer. Talking about the battery, it's nice to know that you can change it yourself and at a much lessor expense than with a Kindle. I'll probably never need it but it's also nice to be able to add a memory card to hold more content. And the Nook just looks nicer in my opinion.The new update was released the same day I received my Nook and I updated the firmware the second day I had it and it runs even more smoother. I have been a gadget man all my life but this is my first touch screen device. I had no problems what-so-ever navigating the menus and the menus changed fast enough for me.My wife still loves her Kindle but I think she is a little jealous. She asked me why I didn't get her a Nook for Christmas.I was completely in the dark about ereaders until just 2 months ago. I know during my research I found people that were experiencing  problems and were unhappy with every reader I checked into. If you were putting off getting a Nook because of bad reviews, I would give them another look. There has been 2 firmware updates already that probably addressed many of the earlier concerns. That's not bad for a device that was only released a short while ago. I'm sure there will be further updates as time goes on and it will get only better.~eddie",positive
"I am still waiting for the perfect ebook reader. I bought the Nook for these reasons: 1) It reads industry-standard ePub-format ebooks, 2) it's tightly integrated with the B&N; ebook store, 3) the ebooks are encrypted in a well-documented easily-understood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in, say, your iPad's Nook reader software, or even in a Sony Reader (with the very latest firmware), without having to be re-purchased because of DRM nonsense.The problem is that the Nook simply doesn't live up to its promise. The ""paper-white"" display is more an off-beige, and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light (necessary because it has no backlight, as is true for all ePaper devices). It's heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push, especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day. The ""5 day battery life"" in reality for me has been a 1-day battery life, read a book, and it needs to be recharged, and be darn sure to turn it off. The thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software, and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software. The latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudo-folders, which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the Nook is to scroll through its book list (get about 50 books on the list and you're in for major pain), but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who've gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads.Sad to say, I really can't recommend any current eBook reader. Either they're too clumsy to use (Nook), have no books available for them (Sony), or have a proprietary eBook format that locks you into a single vendor (Kindle). I'm seriously considering buying an iPad, yes, it will only work for 9 hours or so on a battery charge, but that's true of the Nook too in real actual use and the iPad is usable for a lot of other things too. It's just disappointing that I can't get an ePaper-based reader that meets my criteria (non-proprietary ebook format, long battery life, compact, decent user interface), and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor. Well, I don't like crippled, so I'll look elsewhere, thank you very much...",positive
"I purchased the Kindle 1, then a BeBook (because it reads PDFs), and now a Kindle DX for the Text-To-Speech. The Nook looks so cool, until you own one. Heavy copy protection, even on PUBLIC DOMAIN books is ridiculous. And, from what I am reading on the web, the books are encoded with a person's credit card # and other personal info. So ... hackers can rejoice if I loose my Nook.Anyway, books are still cheaper on Amazon.The color touch screen is cool, until you realize that it takes up SOOOO much of the reading area and ... costs battery!Maybe next year, the nook will be ready for prime time.",positive
"First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!What a great gift, and a great buy!!!",positive
"I got my Nook Wi-Fi/3G about 2 months ago, and I love it!  I researched ALOT of ereaders before making the decision to buy the Nook; in fact, I originally bought a Kindle from a local store, but never took it out of the box, and returned it to purchase the Nook.I originally decided to go with the 3G for two reasons; 1) I wasn't sure I could set up my home wi-fi to work with the Nook, and 2) I wanted to be able to purchase books from absolutely anywhere.  And I've been glad I chose that; I have yet to purchase a book over just the wi-fi.  I was at a doctors office recently, waiting and waiting and waiting, and it was wonderful to be able to shop, buy a book, and start it while enduring the endless waiting.The customer service from Barnes and Noble is great, all I have to do is walk in the store with my Nook and the employees are knowledgable and helpful for helping with the Nook.  Also, the store nearest me has ""classes"" on Saturday afternoons for Nook/NookColor owners, and I found that to be very helpful when I first purchased my Nook.Speaking of the physical store, I also like that I can read any book for FREE for up to an hour a day in the store.  That gives me the opportunity to read alot more of a book than just what they provide as a ""free sample"" and lets me decide whether to purchase the book or not.I've looked at the newest generation Nook, which has just recently become available, and I'm glad I got my Nook when I did; I like it so much better than ANY ereader I've looked at.  I can drop my nook in my purse, and anytime I'm stuck somewhere and want to read, I've got a whole library right there with me.  The Nook is awesome!!!",positive
"Pros: Very nice display , clear than Sony Prs-600S. 5 Star for this.Cons: Touch screen not responsive, navigation is not good. It is a stupid to have two screen for read and menu. waste spaces. Software looks buggy, very irresponsive even if updated the firmware to latest 1.4.3., 2 star for this.Final star 3.",positive
"I have been super happy with this reader.  In the bright sun sitting outside, no problem.  On the many flights I take, no problem.  B&N; site and downloading books is a breeze.  I've got a Droid X phone, and the accounts sync, so I can quickly pull up the same book on my phone with the Nook App, very cool.I can lend, and have others lend me, some of the books purchased.Our local library in Central Texas, outside Austin, is connected to Overdrive.com.  With my library card I can download epub books and check them out, anywhere I've got internet.  I don't have to check them back in, they just go away after the check out period.  Same with Audiobooks.  Nook handles this format, other eReaders do not, so you might want to look into this option and what formats the readers have before making a decision.I like the onscreen keyboard/touch screen, personally.  It is bright and easy in areas where dimly lit and the light in your reader case is directed at the reading screen.  Seems like no big deal, but after 28 hours on a plane you get tired and this makes a difference.Not a bunch of keys to hit/press with the keyboard exposed.  This is a personal opinion, and I can absolutely understand why others may want the keyboard.  I put in pagemarks etc on books, but don't type a lot of notes into the ebooks when reading.  If you do a lot of this, you may want to test run the onscreen keyboard and see if you like it.  I don't, the amount of typing is very limited, so onscreen is perfect and I'm used to it with my phones.Using this over wifi to surf the internet is something you can do, but it isn't the best.  You can in a pinch, but it's easier for me to pull out my smartphone and crank into a website.The number of places to get books, especially free ones, is awesome with the Nook handling so many formats.  B&N; just search 0.00 and titles and you'll get thousands of classics come up that copyright is over and they are free.  gutenberg.org is puts free classics by the tens of thousands out that you can download onto your Nook for free, google books does this and a few other sites.  Tons and Tons of books for free, I haven't read Tom Sawyer in 20+ years and am now, for free.  Just an addition to note.Lots of periodicals, newspapers etc, that you can get daily.I take my kids into B&N; and they love to look through the kids books.  While there, I can read any book over their Wifi for free for up to an hour.  I don't use this a lot, but once a month or so when I take the kids, it's pretty cool.Overall, I'm really pysched, this Nook has been awesome.",positive
"Most of the other reviews have the details about what is good and bad in their opinion, and most of it is accurate. The battery life is misrepresented by B&N.; The only way you could possibly get 10 days out of the battery is if it is off. However, 2 to 4 days is a real possibility, So, bring your charger or USB to computer cable. Just like Apple IPOD, the B&N; folks decided to use a non-standard USB cable that appears to match the Apple ones. This is a minor problem, but do not expect to borrow a USB cable from someone while on travel. The included small charger worked very well.The key thing is how does the NOOK function as a book reader. In my opinion, it is adequate, and no more. I downloaded a number of free books without any problem. I also downloaded some paid books form B&N.; Once again, no problem. Finally, I downloaded some books from my public library onto my computer (not the NOOK)using the free Adobe software. Using the USB cable to my NOOK, I simply dragged the books to the NOOK, and voila, two seocnds later they were available for 14 days. So far so good. One could now rant about the interface (so-so), or the fact that you should reduce the color-screen brightness to about 10% to save the battery as well as turn off the WI-FI when not in use, and so forth, but how does it work when reading a book.If you are like me, and read fairly fast, most books will be a real page turners, since there is not much on a page compared to a real print on paper book. The print is clear. It is faily black on a slightly grey background (some might say off-white), which under a bright reading light is quite comfortable. For the eyesight challenged, there are bigger fonts accompanied with still more page turning. The same is true of the KINDLE. Page turning is easy and intuitive, so not a problem. Use the buttons on the side, not the color interface.A big feature of the NOOK is the ability to add a memory card. Well it is true you can do this, but it is not for the faint of heart or fingernail impaired. The first time you try to open the NOOK using the nearly invisible tab, you will wonder if you are going to break the cover. Just be careful, follow the instructions, and all will be well. Now, why would you want to add memory. As it arrives, the NOOK holds a huge number of books. You might want to add some of your work in PDF documents - this chews up space fast - and the pdf reading capability is primitive at best. Get a small netbook for this purpose and leave the NOOK for books. Changing the battery-RIGHT! Perhaps at the end of life, 2 to 3 years, to save a service trip. By then the technology will be antique, and you will replace the whole NOOK, not just the battery.A disappointment is the lack of even a primitive browser so that you could check email without lugging along another computer. The KINDLE has this feature. The NOOK can be ""upgraded"" to also have a browser, but then it is non-standard, and you might have trouble as B&N; upgrades the official firmware. Perhaps B&N; will relent and give us email capability similar to the APPLE I-Touch. I can understand not wanting to overload AT&T; with too much traffic, but simple text emails should not have been a problem.Finally, why would you want a NOOK in the first place. Remember, real books use no power, are truly random access, can be lent to anyone for as long as you like, and will function far into the future regardless of technology changes. The only purpose I can see for having a NOOK is for travel and for electronically borrowing books from a library without getting into your car or walking overmuch. Well, scratch the last, since you can borrow and read books on your computer. The airplane travel or train commute is a biggie. Books are heavy and bulky. Carrying 6 books onto an airplane is a pain. Plus, hauling out your NOOK to read makes you look technically COOL, and for the short term, is sure to start a conversation with a nearby stranger. The conversation might be interesting and better than the NOOK-book you were going to read.Well, I've written enough and am going to read a book that I just downloaded from the local library. I'll try not spill my soup on the NOOK while reading and eating -or it would become a SOUPER-NOOK.",positive
"I bought the original nook in Aug. 2010. Initially, I liked it, but I quickly learned that the battery life wasn't nearly the quoted time (it lasts about 2 days for me, 3 max with wireless off and the most power-saving settings). The e-ink/lcd screen mix was nice for navigation, although I understand that the newer touch models will be more battery-efficient. Despite this drawback, it was so much more convenient than paperbacks. As much as I love the feel of books, in a NYC apartment, there just isn't all that much room for them!That nook lived for about 9 months until a part of the screen died - just black pixels. I called customer service and after a long painful process, got it replaced. The unit I got was clearly a refurbished unit, which wouldn't have bothered me, had it been identical to the one I sent it. My original nook had a two-part screen, this new nook had a one-part screen and its' buttons squeaked when pressed. Little did I know at the time that this was the sign of a very important defect! As it happened, this 'squeaking', which made the buttons difficult to press, also caused the page-turn buttons to crack just one month past warranty. Needless to say, I wasn't delighted. Apparently, the page-turn buttons cracking is a very common defect. So if you buy a nook, remember this: if the button squeaks and is hard to press, it will break. Return it while you can. Not all the nooks are like this (my old one wasn't), so I recommend checking it out.Overall - 3/5 - it's a solid reading device but doesn't really compare to the new-generation nook simple touch/kindle touch devices or even the Kindle 3 keyboard (which I now also own).",positive
"I bought a Nook today. The one and only reason I chose Nook (instead of just sticking with and upgrading my beloved old Kindle 1) is its ability to download books from the public library. Tomorrow I am taking the Nook back to Best Buy for a refund, not an exchange. The Nook is attractive and nicely packaged. I completely expected it to just work, like my Kindle did (and still does) and all of my Apple products do. But, like so many other reviewers here, my Nook never even got up and running before it croaked. First, it would not complete the registration process. I have an active account on B&N; and strong WiFi in my home, plus this Nook also has 3G so there were not any connection problems. Then, when I decided to just register later and moved on to explore how the Nook worked, it froze. Could not reboot or turn it off by holding down power key as suggested in the troubleshooting help/support on the B&N; website. It did not work. I do not want to mess with taking the back off, using little screwdrivers or whatever to take out (the fully charged) battery, etc. We should not have to do that on a brand new 200.00 product! So, am taking it back and won't buy another until they improve the quality of the thing. I never had one bit of trouble with my trusty Kindle, and would not even be looking at another brand of reader except for Kindle's inability to download library books.  I'm giving the Nook two stars instead of one because, if it actually worked, it looks like it would be a nice ereader and it has a more open format than Kindle does.Update: 1/28/11Went to return the Nook for a refund today and at the last minute decided to give it another go, so did exchange instead. Tonight charged and powered up the replacement Nook, so far so good. It works perfectly. Registration was smooth and fast, wifi connected easily with my signal, downloaded a book quickly, and navigation is a breeze.  No problems encountered yet except that it is not downloading an available firmware update, and there's probably some explanation for that so not a big deal.  So, I might just end up keeping this baby as a companion to my Kindle. Love having the Nook with its open format for library and other downloads. Will see how it holds up over the next several weeks and then update my rating accordingly.Update: 2/3/11Returned the Nook to Best Buy today and bought a Kindle 3 through Amazon. After exchanging the first defective Nook then using its replacement for several days I found that the device worked pretty much as it was supposed to. There are a couple of minor things about it that I was not crazy about and probably would have gotten used to, but there is one problem (design flaw?) that for me is definitely a deal killer. One of the minor annoyances is that there is a lot of screen flash during any menu change. Another is that the color, lighted touch screen control at the bottom of the device is distracting when it lights up at any touch during reading. And after a while I was not that crazy about the menu navigation either, seemed like too many steps and screen flashes, but probably could have gotten used to that too. I would not have rejected the Nook just over those little quirks. The big reason that the Nook was no way going to work out for me is, again, that touch screen display at the bottom of the device. It is, like an iPad, highly reflective. So what that means is that when the screen is off, which it is most all of the time during reading, you can watch yourself read! The black screen reflects anything in front of it, almost like a dark mirror. That was a no go for me, no I did not like it at all. Aside from these annoyances, the Nook did well at everything it was designed to do. So will upgrade the rating to reflect (haha) that. I have to say that I am much happier with the Kindle, but Amazon really needs to get with the program and let Kindle use the epub format. They will eventually lose me and a lot of other prospective customers over the epub problem, it is that big of a deal.Yet another update! 5/31/11Caved in and purchased another Nook last week. I still love my Kindle and prefer it over Nook, but just could not wait another minute for Amazon to open Kindle to ePub for downloading public library books. So, last week when B&N; had Nooks for sale cheap on their eBay website (99.00, free ship, 3g/wifi, non-color, refurb w/ full warranty) I jumped on it. This refurb Nook worked much better out of the box than my initial brand new device purchased then returned back in Jan/Feb. I am using the Nook just for library books, and it does what it's supposed to do. Navigation works well, but seems like it requires more step than Kindle. Still do not like the reflective color screen below the reading area. There is one thing that I do like better on Nook, the screen background is a paler gray than Kindle making for easier reading in low light. I will keep this Nook until Amazon does ePub, then stick with Kindle.",positive
"There are a multitude of reviews that compare and contrast the Nook and Kindle, so I'm not going to go into a full-blown comparison and review. I'm going to focus on my experience owning both, most specifically battery life and availability of books.My husband uses the kindle and I use the Nook. The reason I went with the Nook is because initially I was very ""anti"" non-paper book. He wanted a kindle and I sneered at the idea. I was being a book snob and didn't like the idea of books in electronic format, so I snubbed my nose at it.However, after we took a vacation and he had his kindle loaded with books, and I had 8-10 big paper books, I began to reconsider my position.  Upon return from our vacation I elected to get a Nook. I did so because I liked the idea of the touch screen at the bottom rather than the keyboard, which I thought made the kindle look klunky. I thought overall that the Nook was more aesthetically pleasing. So - I ordered the nook.There are two major things that the kindle has on the Nook, and that is far superior battery life, and significantly more books available for download - especially so if you read non-fiction.The battery life on my Nook is awful. So much so that I ordered a new battery thinking perhaps I had a dud. Nope - it's performance is just the same. If I am actively reading a book I have to recharge  every 3 days. If I don't read it for 10-14 days it will drain on it's own. Comparing this to my husband's kindle, he can go an entire 2 week trip reading books daily without having to recharge his kindle! It takes a couple months to drain with no usage. The kindle's battery life is mega-much more than my Nook. I have serious battery life envy. For that alone I've begun to covet his kindle.The second bummer is that most of the available books for Nook are fiction. There are some of the more popular non-fiction type books available. Usually whatever is most trendy at the time, but for the most part any professional type texts, or anything not on a best seller list that is non-fiction can't be found for the Nook platform. However, when I go to Amazon, 8 of 10 times, I'll find it available for download on the kindle.BUT! One thing about this is that for me, I tend to mark up and highlight my non-fiction books a lot because I'm using them for reference sources. It is very difficult to quickly retrieve highlighted text from the electronic source compared to my real, paper books. So I've actually come to realize that I'd likely be purchasing my non-fiction as real paper books anyways, so that I can have them for ready reference and mark them up with my highlights and little flags (yes - I'm a geek who uses the little flag tabs to mark pages in my books!) So, I'm now fine with the fact that I can't readily download non-fiction to my Nook and instead I continue to buy them as regular, paper books. As I said above, I'd likely buy my non-fiction as real books anyways since I use them as references.I now download all my fiction books to the Nook. So it's become my source for pleasure reading, which is great, since that is the kind of stuff I take with me when I travel or about town anyways, and can just stuff the Nook in my purse.However, I VERY MUCH ENVY THE BATTERY LIFE OF THE KINDLE! If I could stuff a kindle battery into my Nook I'd be a super happy girl.If I had it to do over I'd likely buy a kindle for myself despite it's less aesthetically pleasing appearance. The battery life and availability of books is far superior to the Nook.",positive
"Had this for sevral months now and I love it. I love the touch screen which lets me see the covers of books in COLOR!VERY easy to set up account with B&N; using my nook. It serches for wi-fi and is very easy.Anytime I have had any problem, a simple re-boot fixes it.I love the ""free Friday"" that is offered. I have read SOOO many books since I bought it.I also think I would like the ""Lend Me"" option if any of my friends HAD a nook.",positive
"Pros: eInk display preserves traditional reading experience and has great clarity and contrast. Reads PDF (both scanned and standard text) and EPUB book formats with no hassles or conversion required. In-store help and extra features from B&N.; Page turning speed is much improved with most recent update. Android OS allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features. Replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily. Accepts SD cards for increased storage capacity (this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp3 player or for audiobooks).Cons: eInk display requires you to operate at a bit slower pace than the touchscreen alone would allow. (Also: Not sure why the price from this supplier is abnormally high?)I've played with an iPad and it's a very fun device. But what I don't like is a glowing backlit screen, as I look at a monitor all day. When I read, I want to relax and give my eyes a break, and that's why I prefer eInk displays.The Nook's primary advantage over the Kindle is that it allows you to read EPUB and PDF books (scanned or text; either works) and buy books from various online ebook stores, including the Sony Reader store. This has already allowed me to read two titles that I wouldn't have been able to get for the Kindle. It also works very easily with Adobe Digital Editions software, a huge plus. Currently Amazon offers some titles that B&N; does not (a very temporary state of affairs, I suspect), but those are usually available from Sony.Add the book loan feature, free library books, and the ability to take it to a B&N; store for bonus features, and this unit pretty much stomps the Kindle and Sony readers.The Nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the e-Ink screen, but once you get used to it, the device seems very smooth. In fact, I find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax, and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen, reading with the Nook is a very pleasant experience. I now prefer it to reading books in print, to be perfectly honest.",positive
I have had my Nook for a week now and just love it.  I find the touchscreen easy to understand and use.  I have downloaded books from the local public library using OverDrive and Adobe Digital Edition and all have come through perfectly.  Downloading books from B & N have been quick and efficient.  I like being able to Find/Search forward and backward and to be able to look up words easily.  I have used bookmarks and highlights as well.  I also like the feature of being able to go to Last Read Page or to quickly pick a page using the Go To.  I have downloaded my own wallpaper and screen savers.  The two reasons I chose the Nook over the Kindle:  local support at Barnes and Noble and the ability to borrow ebooks from the public library.  I also easily added my own MicroSD card and added personal PDF documents to it. I love reading on it!!!,positive
"I will continue to update this review as I discover new features of the Nook, so stay tuned folks!*****************************************************************************Updated 02/08/2010*****************************************************************************I've been using my Nook with the newest update (v 1.2) for a few days now.  This is the second update to the Nook since launch.  All I can say is THANK YOU Barnes & Noble!The LCD screen improvements alone are GREAT!  With better looking icons, more responsiveness, and a sleeker appearance -- it makes me think of that McDonald's commercial: I'm lovin' it!Several of the well documented issues have been fixed, such as losing bookmarks due to powering off the unit -- which as it turns out was the most cited problem for Nook bashers and haters alike.  Nook haters will also be disappointed that the battery life has been optimized too.All-in-all if you've been waiting for the minor 1.0 issues to be fixed prior to purchasing the Nook you will not be disappointed in this newest version.  And if you have been considering switching from the Kindle you would be well advised to do so at this point.*****************************************************************************Updated 01/31/2010*****************************************************************************This device is clearly the best option on the market today, with it's LCD touchscreen, Wi-fi, memory expansion capabilities, and so, so much more. Let's ""wade in the weeds"" and look at some of the features in detail:LCD TouchscreenSo far this is the only mainstream reader to offer a LCD screen of any kind. The Coverflow-like book cover listing is beautiful, elegant, and functional. With the newest update it is uber fast, intuitive, and responsive. Page turns are super easy with the touchscreen, all you have to do is swipe the screen with one finger when it's in standby mode and the page turns.  In addition, it's easier for me to navigate books via the LCD than textually. Seeing the cover is a really nice feature, since books are designed to pique your interest by the cover. It just seems like a good cover sells a book, and seeing that cover in crisp LCD sells me from time to time.The keyboard is nice, any time a text field comes up you will have the keyboard pop up on queue. It's fast, responsive, and best of all doesn't look like a 1970's era fax machine keypad like some of the older readers on the market.Wi-fiThe built in Wi-fi is one of the great features of this device. Modern 3G speeds are pretty fast, but as most of us know that have smartphones, Wi-fi is about 100 times faster, especially when one tries to download large things, or a lot of content. The Wi-fi on this device is no exception... it's fast and super easy to set up. The on screen instructions are sooo clear to follow. I couldn't imagine only having 3G these days, like when you are in an area that doesn't have 3G coverage, you can still use the Nook over Wi-fi.  This is truly one of the killer features of the Nook.  You can go into a B&N; store and Wi-fi to your hearts content, but then come home and do the same.  Hotels offering free Wi-fi are the Nooks biach.Memory ExpansionThe Nook has a Micro-SD card slot which accepts up to 16GB Micro-SD cards, this allows you to upgrade your memory indefinitely. Another advantage would be to organize your books. And books on the card are never going to get lost if your reader dies -- without having to re-download from the cloud.  Plus with the new B&N; desktop reader you can move your books from the Nook to a laptop/netbook on the fly, and what if the worst should happen and your eReader dies?  You still have those books on the card.AppearanceThis is a biggy for me as it is for most people... I don't tend to buy or use things that look ugly. That's why I've got an iPod instead of a Zune, why I've got a LCD TV instead of a CRT, and now why I've got a Nook instead of another reader. The appearance of this device can be described with one word, SEXY. It just looks good. Other readers currently available range from looking ""not too bad"" to looking downright ugly. This reader is the exception to that rule and employs a host of features to boot.Book formats and availabilityThis is probably the biggest of all the features, since we are talking about a book reader, the Nook boasts a whopping 1,000,000 books available for it, in readily readable format, from just two sources (B&N; and Google). The nearest competitor only offers 500,000 books in it's native format (Kindle). You can convert many books to a Kindle readable format, but it's a hassle and you have to use your computer to do that. Sort of defeats the purpose of the wireless if you have to constantly connect to the PC. And there are third party sources for books in Kindle format, probably websites you've never heard of, new sites pop up all the time since Kindle has a big install base, but the quality of books on those sites is in question compared to a reputable company like Google.eInk displayIt seems to be crisper than much of the competition out there. The ability to change the typeface and size of the fonts is wonderful. The nearest competitors screen almost seems fuzzy in comparison, which for me makes it harder to read. Page changes are fast on the Nook, while nothing can compare with the speed of changing a real books' page, it's fast enough for the average person. Speed readers may find themselves waiting for a few milliseconds though. The controls on the Nook are straightforward and intuitive.Replacable batteryThis is another biggy for most ebook people, with the Nook you can change the battery out should you A) want extended reading times without charge, or B) if the original battery dies for some reason.  Many of the other readers on the market do not allow this, which means they are bricked if the battery dies and will either have to be repaired or replaced.Battery lifeA lot has been said about the battery life of the Nook, and other eReaders.  All of the manufacturers of these devices overstate the real world battery life in real world useage situations.  I have a co-worker with one of the Amazon (Kindle Brand) eReaders and he has to charge every 3 - 4 days.  Nook lasts for me about 5 - 7 days, but it all depends on what features you use on either or any of the devices and how much you use them to determine actual, real world battery usage. Either way, all of these devices are easy to charge.  Just plug into a standard 110 - 120 outlet and PRESTO!  Or in the case of the Nook, you can also plug into your computer/laptop/netbook and VOILA!  You will be on go in no time flat.Ease of useThe Nook is easy to set up and use, The onscreen keyboard is more familiar and similar to modern devices than many of the competitors setups.SummaryThere are so many features of this device it's hard to capture them all in one review. All in all this is one great device, with it's iPod like look and feel, large number of built in features, and industry standard operating system, it's clearly the choice of discerning electronics customers.*******************************Update*******************************So, I had been told on these comments that the B&N; in store functionality was not ready to be used yet -- another lie dispelled today.  I stopped in at the B&N; in Hillsboro and it is in fact fully functional.  My Nook immediately recognized the B&N; network and connected without me even having to tell it to!  As it turns out there is exclusive content at each B&N; store, at this particular one there were multiple books that could be downloaded for FREE!!!  So, seeing one that piqued my interest I naturally downloaded it.  Wow, super fast and convenient, and FREE!",positive
"The Nook is the best e-reader yet. It replaces the keyboard on the Kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iPhone display. This makes it easy to maneuver between  the store, your library, your current book, the daily (with messages, newsletters, and other free content), and settings. The LCD display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed, and then turns off when reading.You can connect by both WiFI and free 3G to download a purchase in seconds, and connect with WiFi to get content and other offers when you walk into a B&N; store. I'm using the latest 1.1.1 SW release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews. Updates are done automatically over the air.The nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip. Controls are provided for equal usability by a left or right-hander person. The back is removable and replaceable with different colors. They are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop. Unlike the Kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable. The e-ink display is the same type, but appears to be slightly crisper than the Kindle 2. The nook supports  EPUB (Non or Adobe DRM), PDB (Non DRM), PDF, Graphics: JPG, GIF, PNG, BMP, Audio: MP3, PDB. The online B&N; bookstore has about a million books compared to the Kindle store with half that, the major difference being the free public domain books provided by Google.Summary:While it costs the same as the Kindle, the nook is loaded with extra features: WiFi, color LCD, removable battery, expandable memory, more open book formats.  You can customize your nook with your own photos to create personal screen savers and lend between nook, iPhone, a PC and a Mac.",positive
"This is a good item. Even though it's old, it's sticks to what an reader should be. It really is good for just reading books. It has great battery and the 3G works everywhere",positive
"I already own a Wi-Fi + 3G Kindle and had compared reviews between the Nook and Kindle extensively, before buying the Kindle.  But because the Nook allows you to borrow books from the local library for free, and my wife was hogging the Kindle, I decided to try a Nook, at a reduced price.  While the Kindle is clearly a superior product, (lighter, faster, easier to use and much longer battery life), I found the Nook okay at the price I paid.It was a little difficult to learn how to navigate with the touch screen and the set-up seemed ponderous, but once I got the hang of it, I've borrowed a book a week from the library.  The reduced price for the product was because someone had returned it and it presumably had been repaired.  I haven't found anything wrong with it and it looked new, unscratched and unmarked, so as a back-up to a Kindle, I'd recommend it.  I'm getting about 3-5 days of battery life in ""airplane mode"" (wi-fi and 3G turned off), and that's enough to finish a book without recharging.  I'm not rating reliability, because I've only had it for about a month.",positive
"If i had known that the 3g is not good for anything except purchasing books (yes I know it is my fault for not doing more research), I would not have paid more for the 3g version as I don't need the ability to get books anytime anywhere.  The web browser only works on wifi.  Anyway, I really like the Nook. I bought a refurb from one of those daily deal sites for a very good price. I have only had it for about a week so I can't speak for it's reliability but I have loaded lots of free ebooks (what I bought it for) from various sources, some audio books for my kids, and some music.  I like the web browser and the sudoku game.  The only thing I would change if I could is to have an option to combine the ""my b&n library"" with ""my documents"" because when you get books from anywhere else besides B&N, it goes to your documents.  I would like to be able to pull up my ""mysteries"" shelf and be able to see all of my mysteries not just the ""documents"" set or the ""B&N"" set.  I think it would make it more user friendly to have that be an option (only an option since some people probably like it the way it is).  It's a bit heavier than I thought it would be but not unmanageable.  I haven't used the library yet but have gotten epub books elsewhere (the epub ability is the reason I chose Nook over Kindle even though there are a lot more free Kindle books).  Overall, yes I would recommend a Nook but I would have gone for the cheaper wifi version had I known that the 3g was useless to me.",positive
n my honest opinion nook is unfinished product.none of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with middle-size font.i am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadable.formula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable. i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on fine-tuning the text rendering on ebook reader.other issue is font randomly changing from small to medium in pdf format.,positive
"My wife has had a Nook for a few months and loves it.  I ordered one thinking it would be great.  It arrived and I loaded a part of my book collection and immediately ran into trouble.If I loaded a few books all went well but when I tried to load about one hundred it gave me a message that it was looking for new items.  I don't know where it went looking but it was a long long trip.  Ten hours later it was still out looking.I tried everything including customer service.  Emailed - never heard from them.  Phoned and the tech blamed me, the books etc but never the Nook.  Resulting conclusion from him was that I should buy books from Barnes and Noble so they would work.  I asked why they advertized that it would read .pdf and .epb.  He said, well, most of the time it reads them.Phoned tech again and this one said that it was defective and set up a replacement.  Replacement came and it was doing the same thing.  I left it for nearly twelve hours and nothing happening.I googled and found others are having the same problem, some believe it is related to the new update Barnes and Noble put out.  I am no longer concerned as it is on the way back.",positive
"I won't rehash the Nook vs. Kindle issue, but we'll say I chose to buy the Nook because it just sounded better based on what people were saying. HOWEVER - I'd say i made a huge mistake. I loved the way the Nook worked, but reliability becamea huge issue. My first Nook died within 24 hours. I figured it was just a bad egg, took it back, and they completely replaced it with a brand new one. My second one died 6 months later. I took it to two different stores and they were unable to fix it. Since it is still under warranty, They advised I call or email.  Over the last 3 months, I've sent several emails and get auto-responses saying they have a higher volume of messages than usual, please call. I've also racked up tons of cell phone minutes trying to call and have yet to break through before my lunch break is over, or my toddler starts wanting my attention, etc... I guess I'll just chalk it up to a total waste of my money and start saving for a Kindle!!!",positive
"I Wondered if this is designed solely for reading Text-only books/magazines. I have some books with i purchased are in PDF. Plus i have some word documents which i have converted to PDF. Both in my books and in my Word-Converted-PDF files have lot of pictures. Lot of the data are tabular representation are actually pictures. When i read them in nook, The letters in the pictures are virtually unreadable as they are too small. When i try to increase the font size, it does not work. IT WORKS ONLY FOR TEXTS! I Have never used kindle so don't know if the issue is there in kindle too. Also the PDF Pages are scattered all over the place. 1 Page in actual PDF file appears as 3 pages sometimes with a blank page in between. Not sure what is causing this.MY Nook does have a Web Browser but it only works with WI-FI, Not with the 3G. In 3G you can ONLY interact with BarnesandNobles.comThe touch screen response and user-friendliness are OK. Not great, After dealing with much more faster and better touch screens we use now-a-days.Go for it (And Kindle) if you are reading Text only book with very little or no graphics. AMAZON and B&N; Needs to improve their products and i am sure they will!",positive
"I got the Nook the day before Nook Color was announced. I actually waited until the Nook Color was announced before opening the box - I wanted to see what the new gadget had to offer and if it'd be worth trading mine in.There were some rumors that the Nook Color would feature a screen with Mirasol technology, and I was disappointed to learn that it actually had an LCD screen coated with something to reduce glare. I state at an LCD screen all day at work, and don't want to do the same while reading. Plus, I'm not sure how well the LCD screen would fare in the sun and I'm interested to hear feedback from Nook Color owners.I think the color screen matters if you want to read a lot of magazines, or textbooks, or kids' books, none of which I'll be doing. Nook Color also stores more books (6000) and allows the reader to send updates to Facebook and Twitter directly from the eReader. Personally, I didn't find any of these extra features particularly appealing, so I'm happily sticking with the original Nook.My Observations/Pros of the Nook-It's bigger than I expected, in a good way. It's not heavy, but has a nice ""significant"" feel to it.-I think few people realize how clear and book-like the e-Ink screen actually is. I showed the Nook to some friends, and that was the first thing they noticed.-The bottom LCD touch-screen adds a little oomph with the color buttons and book covers.-Getting ePub books from the public library has been surprisingly easy, although you have to connect the Nook to a computer in order to transfer the ePub files.-I've been enjoying the Nook Facebook group where administrators post a free eBook every Friday.-The instructional videos online are very helpful in getting started with the Nook.Cons-BN.com has a Free NookBooks section, but for some reason, not all the free eBooks are listed. I saw some Kindle titles that were available for free, and when I searched on BN.com, turns out they were free there as well.-I didn't care much about the LendMe feature of the Nook, but it was still disappointing to learn that not all purchased eBooks can be lent out. Publishers control which titles can be used for lending, and each book can only be lent out once....ever.-The PDF manual for the Nook is very confusing and can benefit from some serious editing.-There are definitely more Kindle books than NookBooks available, but I hope that will change in the near future.All in all, I am pretty happy with the Nook and I think the fact that it supports a wider range of eBook formats outweighs many of the cons. I like not being tied down to one proprietary format and being able to check out eBooks from the library is priceless to me.",positive
"Very happy with the purchase of the nook.  Wonderful minimalist design lends well to an e-reader - It's easy to hold and is the perfect size for those used to the size of a paperback (slightly larger, yes, but certainly not as large as the Kindle or the Ipad).  I'm tired of these negative reviews about devices that are defective - Yes, we all get electronics that go bad, but really, can't you talk about the functionality of the device a bit?  Anyway, the device isn't perfect (interface not as smooth as the Ipad), but for the price and functionality it's great.  I can read e-books borrowed from my local library, have free 3G service when I'm out and about, and I like the fact that the reading screen is not touch based (avoids fingerprints).  All in all, worth the price.",positive
"perfect, as described Thank you",positive
"Great Product Great Sale, I just Love this product, and my children will too I want one for myself this is suppose to be their christmas gift but I want one now.",positive
"The Nook HD is a great $100 book reader. It is sometimes on sale for even less at Barnes & Noble stores.It is NOT an Apple Ipad, but it will let you check email, surf the internet, listen to music on Pandora or watch movies on Netflix.Barnes & Noble stores have free classes to teach you how to use your Nook and most have an expert in the store every day to answer questions.An owner's manual is provided in the Nook's preloaded library. Work through the manual page by page to learn all of its features.Add a 32gb or 64gb memory card and carry your favorite movies on vacation.",positive
It's a fine tablet.  The screen is excellent.  The speakers are very good.  The interface is a little clunky but easy to use.  It does just what I want it to do and it does it well.,positive
I couldn't have asked for a better product! I upgraded from the Nook Color to the HD and I am super happy!!!,positive
I had to put generic Android on it because Barnes and Noble had it so hamstrung. Should have gone with the new 7&#34; Nexus. No built in GPS turned out to be a major lack.,positive
"I am already a kindle owner and I love my kindle. The kindle does have some limitations, most especially in the handling of pdfs. The kindle does not annotate and curate highlighted text of pdf's you upload. This is where I found the Nook HD more useful, apart from the fact that it gives you full access to the Play Store. In handling big pdf's, the Nook HD is slow and the highlighting of scanned pdf's is not very smooth. I really tried to love the Nook but did not and so I did not use it beyond the first month. I will not recommend the Nook. If your goal is the android store, just get a nexus tablet and download B&N app. It is cheap and works much better than the Nook.",positive
"I had given my kids a Nook Color a couple years ago. Sold it last fall and got 1 girl a Kindle Fire 2nd gen, and the other a Lenovo A2107. The Lenovo was absolutely horrid so I wanted to replace it. This summer, when the Nook HD got Google Play, and the prices fell, I sold the Lenovo and got my daughter the Nook HD 16gb Snow. She absolutely loves it! I liked it so much, I got the Nook HD 8gb for myself. I like it much better than my Kindle Fire HD. The size is smaller, and thinner, and lighter, which are great things. And you can put whatever wallpaper you want on it, unlike the Fire HD.I sold the 2nd gen Kindle Fire and gave the other daughter the Fire HD, but she has since switched to a Nook also (HD+). So now I have the Fire HD and the Nook HD for myself. I like the Nook HD better for the reasons stated above. Size and weight are so much smaller on the Nook HD. The screen resolution is also better. There is nothing I don't like about the Nook HD. I did put a GreatShield Glare Screen protector on the Nooks, to reduce the shiny glare. We use them without cases, just sleeves. They are phenomenal tablets.If you or the person you are buying for loves to play games and will likely download hundreds of them, definitely get the 16gb Nook HD. You will want as much space for apps as you can afford, despite the SD card slot. Games have to be installed to internal memory, for the most part. The SD card slot comes in handy for books, movies, photos and music. I got the 8 gb Nook HD for myself, because I don't play games, the only apps I need are for reading, playing music, news, web, stuff like that. I put my files on the SD card and I am set!I don't plan to buy the new Fires when they come out.  They are far too limited, in my opinion. (So was the Nook, of course, until they added Google Play). I have ADW Launcher on all three of the Nooks, though my daughters tend to prefer the standard Nook launcher. What shows up on that home page can be customized to show only what you want it to show. There is also an ""app drawer"" icon that shows the most recently opened apps for easy launching. It really is a great design, and far superior to the tiresome carousel on the Kindle Fires.",positive
"Bought it for my wife to use primarily as a reader but also to occasionally access the net and read email when not at her computer.  She absolutely loves it.  It's the perfect product for her.  The reader portion is excellent.  The web graphics are vivid and colorful.  It has great functionality for such a small machine and last but not least, the price is right.",positive
"Exactly the same as from Barnes and Noble but less expensive. It has been working great and doing more than I even needed. Wow! Arrived on time, I was a bit worried about the packaging as it came in a bubble envelope in its Nook box, but everything was fine.",positive
She has been using a Nook e-reader for several years. I decided to get her the tablet because she wants to read email and browse as well as read her ebooks.  Her little smart phone was just too small to use.  Now she's using it regularly to browse and can easily read her gmail.,positive
This is a very good tablet for reading..satisfied with my purchase..very handy and easy to tucked in your purse or in your hands..just convenient for my need..,positive
"Brand loyalty aside, the NOOK HD AND the Kindle FIRE HD are both great products. I have a Barnes & Noble store about one mile away. I called with some typical learning curve operating questions and was treated with courtesy and competence. my After my poor effort to explain the issues on the phone, the local B & N NOOK expert offered to come IN PERSON to help me. Took about 15 minutes.Try that with Amazon! LOLNow with Google Play. An exceptional product with exceptional people backing it up.",positive
Very good product for those with a Nook book collection. Works well with apps. All google play apps are available except for those requiring a camera.  I brought two units for my children and there are lots of apps and books for them. The Nook HD will read certain books allowed. My two units ended up being defective and kept crashing. Was able to return both with no problems.,positive
"When I learned the modifications Barnes & Noble made to its Nooks and saw the price drop, I decided to get one formy very active 6 year-old grandson. He loves it. Despite him being a rough & tumble outdoor boy, it has held up wellfor a few months now. I attribute this partly to solid quality build and partly to the Nook HD 7&#34; being so thin & lightweight.I recommend this tablet, especially for children, a much better buy than those heavier, more expensive & slower tabletssold for children.",positive
"I bought this refurb for under $100 and so glad I did! I tried the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (expensive and glitchy), the Lenvovo Idea Tab (poor performance) before I settled on the Nook. After using tablets at both high and low-end price points I figured I had nothing to lose--and was pleasantly surprised by the Nook's capabilities!On the Nook I can read BN or Kindle books, play Scrabble from the Android store, and watch Netflix. More advanced features such as GPS and camera are unnecessary for me, and I enjoy the simplicity of this device. It has a sturdy build and even though I did not want a white tablet (fear of dirt) it has not been an issue. I have had it for several months and don't feel anxious about using it without a cover.It's ease of use, clean interface, adequate battery life, and features make this a winner for me in the under $100 category. Add to that BN's 1-year warranty and I am more than satisfied with my purchase.My only qualm with the Nook HD is that it has a proprietary charging cable (not a micro usb like cell phones) so it is an extra cord to carry when traveling. In addition, it will not fit just any usb plug (something to do with wattage, I think). So if you plug the usb end into a travel charger or car charger it may not work. Same thing with using a usb port on a computer. IMO this is a major limitation for an otherwise great device, especially for someone that travels frequently.",positive
I had a Nook Tablet which was fine. Saw these at Barnes and Noble and picked some up for the kids. The difference between the HD and the table is night and day. The screen is amazing. The addition of Google play makes this an incredible value in a tablet. It also turns it into a Kindle. The kids are busy on all our long car rides. The SD card make it completely expandable. We can watch Netflix with Wi=fi or load the SD card with movies for a road trip. It's under 100 bucks too. GREAT!,positive
"I got one of these for Christmas, and I LOVE it! At first I wasn't all that fond of it because the only way to purchase apps and such was to use the nook store, but recently they had an update that added all sorts of Google apps, including Google Playstore. It has great graphics compared to previous nook tablets. It is great to read with, but the books are a little pricey.Now that it has Google Playstore and great graphics, I can't think of a reason for somebody NOT to get it!",positive
"I recently bought the nook HD white for 129 greenbacks from BN. I had originally purchased a Kindle Fire HD. The Nook is lighter and the screen is brighter/sharper than the Kindle Fire. With the recent update to allow the full version of Google Play, a lot of the original limitations with the Nook have gone away. The chrome browser beats Silk all the way. You can actually download the Kindle App from the Google appstore and read all the books. However, you cannot install the amazon appstore and I had to buy some of the apps from Google play that I had originally purchased. There are no ads with the nook. Even with the Fathers day sale (which put the Kindle no-ad version at 195), this is cheaper by 65 bucks. An additional benefit is you can add an external SD card and there are options to boot a full blown standard Android Jellybean from the SD card with the nook from places like (AFN - android for nook for just 10 bucks).The two main downsides are that it lacks a front facing camera, but I really have no use for that and the parental controls are not that easy to set as in the Kindle (you can create a child profile and make sure that the password has to be entered, but I have not fully figured it out).I liked it so much that I bought a second nook in smoke color today.",positive
"Pay close attention.  I would be very cautious about swallowing a few of the &#34;most helpful favorable reviews&#34;.  Pay attention to that quoted phrase.  I strongly suspect many are paid reviewers or actually employees or someone connected with the addons for the Nook.  Just a &#34;heads up&#34;.  Amazon loves to put the &#34;favorable&#34; insiders up front because the bottom line is sales and what leaves your wallet into theirs is the driver.My Nook is okay for the $79 at my local computer store that wanted to get rid of them.  Its not a bargain at the prices we see here.  If you're serious about a tablet then save up for a good one if you can.  If not, it should work for you.Most folks are putting out honest reviews, some whine artists, some scammers, some who just need to talk to someone.  We can't do much about that, but we can comb through and pick out what we might be able to trust.",positive
Am tired of non-standard charging cables...  I like micro USB and the majority of hand held electronic devices use micro USB now.  Why is the NOOK HD using a non standard 30 Pin charging cable?  We returned the NOOK to Barnes and Noble!,positive
"I received the basic Nook as a Christmas gift. Never really wanted a reader or tablet. I'm an old-fashioned book kinda gal. But, when my daughter and I decided to make a trip to Spain, I returned the Nook reader and decided to upgrade to the HD so that I could travel with a tablet that would enable me to check email, surf the web, and read books and magazines. I'm just learning to use it but so far I think I'm really going to enjoy having this tablet. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because it didn't come with a manual (I did say I was an old-fashioned book kinda gal). Would highly recommend the Nook HD for your entry into the world of tablets and readers!",positive
"I did such extensive research trying to decide between the kindle and the nook. I settled on the nook because I had read nothing but good reviews and the price was excellent.Positive:It has a beautiful screen with great vibrant color. The adjustable backlight is great for night time reading and reading in the sun.It's lightweight and comfortable to read with.Negetive: I find it has many glitches. From having trouble unlocking my screen, to having trouble getting the screen to even turn on so I can unlock it, to having my kindle application crash every time I get to the end of the book. I understand that it is probably an application issue with kindle, BUT having kindle compatibility was an absolute priority for me, as most of my library is on amazon. Furthermore, my battery doesn't last at all. I have to power down my device every time I put it down, otherwise by the time I pick it up again to read, it's dead. Won't even last a day. I've figured out that disconnecting it from wifi helps it last longer but not nearly enough. I was used to an iPad that lasted almost a week without charging. This battery time is unconvenient and unacceptable.Those are the main glitches that impact my experience with this device. I don't recommend getting this tablet. I would like to purchase the kindle fire and give this away as a gift.",positive
"Just want you to know that I did not get this tablet from Amazon, got it from Walmart but I must say that the tablet is great.  I searched it on Amazon but because it was near X-Mas I went to Walmart and bought one so as to ensure I would have it by X-Mas.  The Nook Tablet looks and works just fine, was a gift for my granddaughter.",positive
I cant say enough good things about this tablet i love it. First off the screen is beautiful.Its vivid and the colors are great.The best for the price no doubt. Its even nicer than the nexus 7 screen.Tablet performance is good for a dual core tabletand the gpu is a good one sgx540 same as some of the ipads so games run pretty well.weight ergonomics and screen size are just right.The quality of this tablet is excellent. It also has Bluetooth which Manny tablets don't have in this price range.Personally i love the Ui Barnes and noble put on this table its nice. And now with Google play you have a gazillion apps to choose from.Battery life is also pretty good and WiFi works well.The tablet has 2 speakers and there decent pretty loud which is nice.I got mine on sale for 100.00 is worth every penny. I guess the only minor thing i found was it gets a little warm at times but that's typical of Manny tablets and phones.,positive
My Daughter bought these for her children through me. They love them.  I would recommend them to everyone that likes this kind of stuff.,positive
"A year after Barnes and Noble dropped the price approximately one hundred dollars the Nook HD+ 9"" is still one of the best values in the tablet market.  The price is starting to creep up for a new one so keep your eyes open for a sale, but don't wait too long because they are no longer being manufactured.There are two primary reasons that I like the Nook HD+ 9"". First of course is the 1920 x 1280 high resolution display.  You will note that  by comparison 1080p is only 1920 x 1080 so this display is 4x3 not 16x9.  In my opinion the extra pixels make browsing web pages more pleasant in both portrait and landscape mode.  The second reason is that this tablet was sold in large numbers so developers have released ROM builds with the latest version of Android KitKat.  These can be used either by flashing the tablet's ROM internally or running KitKat from a micro SD Card and leaving the Nook's original operating system untouched.We have numerous Android devices and were able to download everything we needed for free, but their are companies who sell micro SD cards already set up for around $20.  So for a reasonable price one can get a ""rooted"" android tablet without doing much research and with almost no risk to the tablet or your warranty.This tablet was originally released in November of 2012.  It has a 1.5 GHz OMAP4470 Dual-Core Processor which is a little slower than the Samsung Exynos 4412 dual-core 1.5GHz processor found in the Galaxy Tab 3 8"" that was released in a few months later in mid 2013.  The processor is good enough to play most formats of HD Video, but struggles with games with 3D graphics.  It performs better with the rooted version of KitKat than with the stock Nook OS.We had a Galaxy Tab 3 8"" and now have a Galaxy Tab 4 8"".  They both have a very good GPS and cameras in the front and rear.  The Nook has neither of these features.  But the bigger display with 1920x1280 resolution as compared to 1280x800 on the Galaxy Tabs more than makes up for these shortcomings for most of what we use a tablet for.Many of these were sold so there is a very good support network.  Lots of accessories are available through Amazon and the other usual suspects.  The hardware has proven to be dependable despite a few people who have reported problems here.  They come with a good warranty and extended warranties are available.  I am giving it 5 stars not because it is the greatest tablet ever made, but because at this time at the prices they are going for on sale... it is the best tablet value that I am currently aware of.",positive
"Look folks this is not a $400 IPAD or Samsung.  If you want a wizbang then you don't want the Nook HD.  For me it fit all my needs without needing a loan to buy one.  I ordered my direct from B & N for $179.00.  It came pre registered in my wifes account who has the nook color.  It is very easy to create your own profile and not see all the junk your spouse has but, at the same time can pick what you want that they have.  No need to repurchase what they already have.What Barnes and Nobel doesn't really want you to know is that you can put Amazon's Kindle app on the nook and read Kindle books (both free and purchased from Amazon).  I also noted that, with the Kindle app, you can adjust the fonts and resize PDF documents that you cannot do on the nook when reading PDF's.Lets not forget its a 9 in screen.  Battery holds well at 10 hours.I bought a 32GB SD card and so far have put 15 movies ( and stiil room for many more) on the card to watch in HD. I choose to save the memory on the nook for books or other apps and watch my movies from the tiny SD micro card. Buy ""DVD Catalyst"" ( really cool program for $9.95)(can try it for free)on line to compress those movies from DVD and then it automatically puts it on the micro card.I seen some gripes about them adding Google store.  Not sure how you can complain about ading a whole another facet of apps.  IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN DON'T ADD ANY GOOGLE APPS. Its still a free country.So for reading ebooks, movies, games, apps and many others all for $179.00, for me it hit my tickle spot. I gave it four stars instead of 5 because it did not have a camera, crappy speaker on the back instead of single or dual on the front.  And the power cord is just too expensive for a crummy cable.",positive
"I've bought a few Nooks over the years and have always loaded CyanogenMod (plain Android) off an SD card (and a few times on the actual device).The HD+ is no exception. As long as you understand that it doesn't have a camera, its powerful and inexpensive. It even comes with Google Play! East your hear out Kindle users!Up for your own project? Head over to the XDA developer forums and find out how to load a clean version of Android either right on the device or run it off a microSD card.Great screen, fast processor. This thing still has enough power to run the latest apps and Android OS!",positive
"Well, I bought it because of the 1080p resolution.  The screen quality is beautiful.  I already have an Apple 4th generation iPad, but I couldn't resist on the high quality picture and low price.  After I received the Nook, I immediately rooted with Kit Kat, the latest operating system.  Let me tell you, I am glad that I made the move.  The original Ice Cream Sandwich OS has lag but not Kit Kat.  With Kit Kat, not only the Nook operates much more smoothly, you also get the full Android tablet experience and more apps available from Google Play.I recently stumbled across the XBMC Cine Player Android app in the Google Play store.  With this app, I can now stream over 1500 movies in HD quality for free.  I have been using XBMC for a little while now on both MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, though the Cine Player version's library is not as extensive as the MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, it is good enough for use when you are on the road like in a hotel or something.  With Kit Kat, I experience very little buffering issue. I can also output contents to a TV via the Nook HDMI adapter.  I believe you can output signal to a TV via Google Chromecast but I haven't tried it yet so I can't be for sure.I highly recommend the Nook if you root it with the latest OS.  I am finding more and more things that I can do with the Nook then the iPad due to Android is an open system.By the way, I use N2A to root my two Nook HD+'s.  With a N2A micro SD card, it gives you the dual boot capabilities.  You can use it to boot Kit Kat or the native Barnes and Noble OS without removing the card.  The N2A card doesn't replace the native OS as the Kit Kat OS is stored in the micro SD card so you don't have to be concerned about voiding the warranty from alternating the tablet OS.Bottom line, the Nook HD+ is already a pretty decent tablet.  One can greatly improve its potential with a simple change to the OS.  If front and back cameras and GPS are not necessities for you, the Nook is a good value tablet for 1/3 of the cost of an iPad.  By the way, I bought an external bluetooth GPS for $16 and it works like a charm with the Nook.  One can expect to spend $100 for an external bluetooth GPS if your IOS device doesn't come with an internal GPS.",positive
"Review for Barnes & Noble NOOK HD+A new winner in the ""best value in a mid-size Android tablet"" category.When it was originally introduced at around $270 it was a decent value in a mid-hi range tablet, but limited by the closed B&N; ecosystem.  Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N; content, the value proposition is much improved.  (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy!  But it's worth the wait.)If you are coming from other Nook devices, you'll feel right at home.  If not, you may be surprised to find the combined ""reader"" and ""Android tablet"" interface pretty nice.  It's well thought out and for the most part works very well.  Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you'll soon get the hang if  it.  Don't miss the ""Nook Today"" icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked.  All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change.  (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just ""back"" but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can ""override"" the Nook UI and install other ""launchers"" but I, personally, felt no need to do so.  But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]The size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky).  The 8-9"" range seems to be the sweet spot.  The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness.  Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great.  The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion.  Excellent value at the new price point.The size, weight (very light for this size device), slimness, and easy handling are all good points of this tablet.  Some do not like the Nook hole on the bottom left, but I am fine with it.  It gives a bit of orientation, an easy place to grab the tablet, and so on.  The styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle.HD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful.  This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go.  I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well.  Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course.  The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).The controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use.  The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets.  The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster.  The handy ""HOME"" button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.There are no cameras - and I could care less, but some might.  I'll take the superb screen, great design and build, and other nice features and be happy.  For the techies, it uses 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 proc and 1 GB of RAM.  Not cutting edge, but plenty fast.  Benchmarks I checked were all pretty good and the Nook HD+ is very responsive in use. The back features a nice ""soft touch"" feel that I really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped.The recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well.  Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+.  Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.If you like Barnes & Noble and their books and movie content, then, of course, that is a win for you as well.  It's all here and well integrated.  Plus there are some Nook HD+ specific apps pre-installed and you should prefer them in most cases.  (Note: I made the mistake of updating the Nook Netflix app with the one from the Google Play store -- big No-No!  It did not work at all.  Once I uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the Nook-branded version from the Nook store (free) -- everything worked fine again. I've had this issue with other tablets as well, the Netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet. I had also installed the Android Pandora over the Nook version, but that one worked fine.  So...if you do this and have issues, just uninstall and reinstall from Nook Store/Cloud vs. Google Play Store and you'll be fine.)All of the other Android apps from Google Play that I tried have worked fine.  Pandora, Stitcher Internet Radio, Maps, Amazon MP3, Amazon Kindle (wow! a bit of a surprise!), Gmail, YouTube, etc. all work as expected.  The new openness of the NOOK HD+ is a game changer for the NOOK line, and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion.I bought mine at the local B&N; store and there's a lot of help available there if you need it, which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally.  Very friendly staff and great customer service, what a novel concept!  ;)The Nook HD+ is a ""sleeper"" - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value, being available currently at very attractive prices.  A 5 star item for features, design, performance, and value.",positive
"I cannot believe the seller who sold me this not good, great Nook HD+, that is keeping me very happy. I have been truly blessed, this Nook tablet is the best. I am watching movies on it via Hulu and Netflix and other apps for movies etc. The video and audio are great for me either outside on my porch or indoors.I do not plan to do much more other than playing a game here and there, this tablet is sufficient to my needs. There is no camera, if you need one get another type of tablet. I recommend for those who do not need a super tablet, however, this tablet can do a lot. I just have not tried it all yet. I will  again say this, the video playback to me is awesome,it is truly HD. I am very satisfied with my refurbished Nook HD+, II am getting a lot for very little. I recommend buying thNook for a few dollars worth a  lot of fun.",positive
"I bought this Nook HD+ in the summer for $179 from BestBuy. It seemed like the best value at the time for a 32GB tablet.I thought that it would be good for our trip to Spain.  We ended up using it to watch a few movies on the plane and that was it.Fast forward a few months of neglecting using the Nook and the device will not even turn on.  I keep thinking that I am doing something wrong, but the next step is most likely going to be a trip to BestBuy after I confirm that I ordered the extended warranty (it's been a busy time for us!).So needless to say I am not impressed....UPDATE:Well, the Nook decided to Power on again when I followed the instructions to turn on a ""dead Nook"".  I don't have the instructions right here, but if you find them (has to do with pressing and holding two of the buttons at the same time), make sure to look at your screen very carefully because one of the options is to restore your Nook to factory settings - and you won't want to do that if you have anything stored on it.I will just have to see how it goes.Wish Amazon Instant Video would play on it, but RedBox now offers an $8 monthly subscription rate for 4 dvds at the kiosk and unlimited streaming.That along with NetFlix give me two options for streaming video.",positive
"Having all the iPad models, 9 different Android models, I can say this tablet overall is a bit disappointing. I realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh, but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there. Granted there are price differences and for price alone, this is a decent deal.The hardware itself is impressive. Bought these for our 4 and 6 years which were upgrading from their Galaxy 2 7"" tablets. The most significant issue with these tablets is the B&N; version of an already outdated Android OS_Ice Cream Sandwich, not the latest Jelly Bean which is far far better. It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.Additionally, as this is an 'overlay' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N; puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can 'BUY' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a 'real' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.For the kids, they still like the tablet, enjoy the better graphics, larger screen, etc. Once going graphics is good, sound is adequate though not great, touch input is good. But for me, I could never use this tablet for serious use. My Asus TF700T is my go to tablet, even over my iPad 4,3,2,etc. At this time I am contemplating just selling these and buy Nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure Android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older Android OS. Perhaps if B&N; releases an OS based on Jelly Bean it may improve things.Bottom line, there are far better options in the Android world.PROSGood resolutionTouch is goodGreat balance of size, not large nor small like a 7"" tabletHas Play installedExternal memory card optionCONSB&N; OS is horrible, slow, cluncky, and based on old Ice Cream Sandwich, not Jelly BeanSpeakers are just OKVery limited accessory options compared to even Kindle HD devicesCharger plug is very tight on both of my models.

"Brand new condition. Fast shipping. this tablet is the best deal on a 9&#34; size that you can get.

Beats the Kindle (sorry Amazon) by a mile in functionality, weight and price.",positive

"Bought this to replace the broken micro usb cable on my old charger for my Nook Tablet. Wished I could just get the cable as the AC plug works fine. After 2 weeks the micro usb end of the cable broke again. This is the 3rd Barnes and Noble cable I have gone through and will not be purchasing another from them again. Any plain micro usb cable will charge the Nook Tablet,so save some money and get a cheaper unbranded cable instead.",positive
"I had the original adapter that came with my Nook Color for 2 years without any problems. After 2 years it finally broke, and I didn't even know people were having troubles with their chargers until I had to buy a new one. I have had this one for at least a couple weeks now and again I don't seem to be having any problems with it.The original charger that did finally break was because of the area where it plugs into the system though, which is where everyone is having problems. So I will not deny that this seems to be an issue. For that it loses a star, but because I personally haven't had any major problems with them I will still give it 4 stars.",positive
"The original chargers I had for the Nooks were dying, as in literally falling apart after a couple years. Hopefully these replacement chargers will last just as long, if not longer.",positive
This is the third adapter that I have tried other than buying direct from B&N.  This adapter is quality made and works excellent with the device.  It is better made than the original.  Great value.,positive

"This item does exactly what it says it will do - and at a good price.  If I had a complaint, it was that I did not purchase a longer one for what I need it for.  Of course, this is more of my fault versus the product.But, if the length works for you, and you need a HDMI cable, this will fill the job and do it very well.",positive

they are inexpensive and they get the job done.  i'm glad i got them. i use them with my wdtv at work.love 'em and if i lose them i'll just buy another set or 2.,positive
"GOLD is good. Makes the best quality connections for data trans. Length is more than adequate (6ft), as length can attenuate (diminish) the quality of signals. Also, sheathing to reduce/illuminate cross-talk or interference both in and out of the cable. Used to connect BluRay player (Wi-Fi) to 45 inch Plasma TV w/o a hitch. Amazon Cables are just as good. I think they all come from China. The thickness of the wire and the GOLD plate are both factors in quality data links. Like the size of a hose for water, and how much pressure it will endure.With FREE shipping you can't go wrong, and they are guaranteed. It took about three weeks for delivery.",positive
"I don't have too much exciting to say about the cable.  I'm not a videophile by any means, but the cable works, I don't see any problems with it, and it is a bunch cheaper than I could get from Best Buy...",positive
A cable is a cable. It's going to work 99.99% of the time no matter where you buy it. But Amazon always has the best prices!,positive
this cable works FANTASTIC and i didnt have to pay $60 for it. i highly recommend!! so glad i gave a cheap price hdmi a shot.,positive
The price was right and I cannot discern a difference between this cable and a higher priced cable I have in my possession. Maybe I'll see a difference when I upgrade to 4K products.,positive

"This film is definitely not for anyone who is especially fond of the independent, delightfully manipulative and clever boy who was the brain child of Samuel Clemens's classic.As one example, the book has great  fun with the scenes involving Aunt Polly, a simple minded soul who thinks  herself quite clever, and the genuinely shrewd Tom, who plays on catering  to Polly's illusions about her own wit. This is a far cry from beautiful,  intelligent Celeste Holm's portrayal of Polly - and the family's poverty,  clearly seen in the book, disappears, as the Sawyers occupy a beautiful  home and are close friends with wealthy Widow Douglas.Some of the plot  is distorted in ways that remove the charm of the original. Tom's taking  off to &quot;play pirates&quot; after Becky jilts him is changed into a  troubled kid's escape after Aunt Polly tells him how &quot;no good&quot;  his father was - the humour, and the engaging portrayal of adolescent  &quot;first love&quot; is gone. The theme of Tom's learning responsibility  is overworked, and sequences that are hilarious in the book (Sunday school,  classroom, etc) are largely left out. The enchanting Becky Thatcher is  reduced to a tomboy. And isn't much of the picnic sequence ruined when a  gathering of kids is changed to a song-and-dance outing for families? (Tom  Sawyer is quite realistic in its setting forth that kids are far more  concerned with themselves than fretting about parents - let's not turn it  into a commentary on &quot;family values&quot; a la 1990s political  correctness.)Johnny Whitaker's singing voice has all the appeal of  chalk squeaking on a blackboard. His rendition of &quot;If I Were God&quot;  (aside from its text having nothing to do with the story - Tom's only  church interests are in time to play with his pinch bug) is pure purgatory  for the listener.",positive
"I hadn't heard of this 1973 movie version of the classic Mark Twain story until recently, but I absolutely had to see it.  After all, it had music by the Sherman Brothers (best known for their work in Mary Poppins).  And I love a good musical.The book stays very true to the novel.  Tom Sawyer (Johnny Whitaker) is a young boy growing up in 1840's Hannibal, Missouri.  An orphan, he's being raised by his Aunt Polly (Celeste Holm).  And he is quite the handful.  He regularly plays hooky to fish and swim with best pal Huckleberry Finn (Jeff East).  He constantly lies to get out of trouble, too.Through this movie, we watch as Tom struggles with his conscience after witnessing a murder in the cemetery.  He tricks the boys in town to white washing the fence for him.  And he develops a crush on new girl Becky Thatcher (a young Jodie Foster).  But will Injun Joe (Kunu Hank) get his sworn revenge on the boy?This movie is extremely faithful to the book, hitting all the highlights of the classic.  Frankly, that was a problem for me since it took a little while to get going.  Once I got into the story, I was hooked and really began to enjoy the tale.  The scenery and costumes recreate the times well.  And the acting was pretty good.Unfortunately, I found the songs disappointing.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good either.  They aren't especially memorable or singable, and they don't really advance the story.  I would rather rewatch this movie for the characters and adventures then the songs.Despite that rather major flaw for a musical, I must admit to enjoying it.  It has a sweetness and innocence that I enjoyed.  And the songs are easy to overlook since they aren't a major part of the movie.  So if you are looking for a fun version of the classic tale, you can do much worse than this one.",positive
I would love to buy this movie as I have been to Hannibal Missouri and been to all the Mark Twain atractions.To buy this movie would be a real treat but if it's Pan&Scan forget it! I dont buy full screen movies! Unless it's made for TV.I think MGM should of included a widescreen version of the movie.What a joke!,positive
"This movie was playing at Radio City Music Hall back in the days of the movie/stage show formt.  It was also presented in 70mm on that huge Radio City screen. I remember how impressed i was with that opening scene with the steam boat going down the river and you see Tom running thru the field and the music builds more and more.  Wow,,,,what a great movie!I've seen many versions of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; but this one seems to be the best ever brought to the screen.  Maybe because it's a musical. Whatever made this so successful back then you will not be disappointed by it's gradure and scope. A must for ever American kid and adult too. This is as red, white and blue as it gets and now must be the most politically incorrect movie ever made. (hehe)  Buy it before some group puts a ban on it. Which should want you to buy this for the kids even more. They don't make them like this anymore.",positive
"This is a well-made and well-acted musical version of the Tom Sawyer story. It does not follow the book exactly, but the substance is there. Charming performances by then child actors Johnny Whitaker (Tom) and Jodie Foster (Becky Thatcher) and Academy-Award-winner Celeste Holm as Aunt Polly. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I rented it for my granddaughter's school project and wound up watching it 3 times. It took me back to my childhood of playing with the children next door in a more neighborly world.Highly recommended.",positive

"Good case, while not new to Kindle books I am new to Kindles, the Fire HD is my first one. I wanted some protection for it as well as something to hold it for me, I often read in bed and with this it stands up some. I wish it were more adjustable. The reality is the way I use it you have two choices, flat, or slightly inclined. The way the pictures show in the upper right it looks like it will stand almost upright, that's not practical for my purposes. I am not sure a case is made that would fit my desires, this is very nice although I felt overpriced.",positive
Not the best leather but worked fine and keeps my Kindle safe and protected.  It should have come with a stylus.,positive
"I got this got a new kindle fire hd owner who LOVES yellow. The case is nice for price, it does what it has to do but the smell at first is very unpleasant. I'm glad it arrived fast and I had time to leave it out of plastic for a few days  to air out till smell went away.",positive

"I bought this at the same time I bought the Kindel Fire HD 7. It is exactly as pictured, the fit was great, and the price was right. The reason for the 4 stars is the cut outs for the volume and power buttons are on the edges of case but the actual buttons are located on the back of the Kindel. You can't access either button while the case is on. Apparently when Kindel upgrades a tablet they don't change the name or add a number to it like Apple does with the iPad. I went back and searched for clues in the description that this was for a different version Kindel and did not find anything. If you want a decent case and you don't want to pay a lot for it, this is the one but just make sure it's designed for the HD 7 Kindel version you are buying.",positive

Bought this to transfer video from some old equipment. (Sony CCD-TRV308 Hi8 videocam and Panasonic Omnivision VHS cassette player.) It's not fancy but does the job. I prefer to use PotPlayer to capture/convert the video over the included software which works ok. I'm satisfied with this purchase.,positive
"I have been using this alot, converting old video tapes, VHS, and tv into online videos. Anything you can play on your vcr, from tapes or tv, it can record.",positive
I bought it to create dvds from home vhs video. Had to upgrade my pc to a faster cpu to avoid jittery recording. After that it work as described. Delivery was fast.,positive
"I got this because it was pretty decently priced, honestly though seeing how some of the other video capture devices out there were upwards of $60 I wasn't expecting much.  When I got, I was rather surprised how well it worked.  While it's plug 'n play, I decided to forgo the install CD and just downloaded the drivers directly from the manufacturer's website.  While the video is decent quality, it still retains some grainyness after burning the video to a DVD, the quality of the original played on a VCR is still better quality than what you capture and burn to a DVD.  That being said, it's not all that bad, really.  But since I only needed to copy a few home videos that we made from an old VHS-C camcorder it wasn't really worth it.I found that the best way to get the best quality was to adjust the video settings manually (add a little more saturation, and sharpness), and use the ""DVD"" format for capture, that were there is minimal second encoding required when you burn to a disc (I use windows DVD maker, because I'm cheap :B)The nice thing is it also includes an S-video option, unfortunately my VCR only allows S-video with 480p signals (ie DVD movies and restricts VCR video to 480i.  The DVD capture format seems to add some deinterlacing to the captured video from what I can tell (though it might just be my video card doing it)  Still, it's a pretty good buy for someone who wants to archive or even send family members burned DVDs of videos.",positive
"I've used this cover with both a Kindle (Generation 2) and a Nook. Surprisingly, this case is better designed for a Nook for two reasons:>>The sleep/power button location. On the Nook, the button is on the top center so none of the four corner holds block any button or access port. However, on the Kindle the button - which requires a slide, not a press - is towards the left of the device top and is covered slightly by the top left corner hold. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I was very surprised at it because its being marketed for the Kindle! So when I want to wake up my Kindle I have to move the corner hold, slide the switch, and then readjust the corner hold. Not easy to do because the hold has a lot of (good) tension.>>5 way directional key. The notebooks that are included with this case slide into the case from the top and still have room to move both left and right. Because of the lining of the case and the thin cover of the notebook, it slides easily but I've never had it come out. I have however had it slide far right inside the cover, and then when I shut the cover it's at such a position that it hits the 5 way directional key and starts to advance chapters! I thought it was just a fluke at first, but then it kept happening. If I do not adjust the position of the notebook or force the Kindle into sleep then the notebook hits the key every time now. The Nook lacks this 5 way directional key entirely, so again - no issues there. (This issue might also be contributed to the ""breaking in"" of the case so that the spine is not rigid anymore and allows the front to move at angles. I don't believe I've been rough with the case though, so I can only assume its common wear).I also want to through my hat into the ring in regards to the less than compact design - though in truth I don't think it could have been any slimmer without causing negative pressure to the devices when closed.",positive
"At the time I bought this cover the Kindle had just come out.(1st generation) It served its purpose , but since then there have been so many new cover in types and styles.",positive
"Aw, come on, Moleskine -- you make a terrific Kindle cover to hold a notepad (Moleskine notepad, even) --- and then NO PEN LOOP? What kind of silliness is THIS???Love it in every way except that darned lack of a pen loop - clipping a pen to it is not the same and I don't want to dent up the cover...Wish it came in more colors, like Moleskine RED and the other Volant shades -- and that one could get the reporter notebooks in colors, too... but this doesn't mean I'm not happy with this!",positive
"Overall: Good Kindle case, especially for Moleskine users. I use it and am happy with it.Pros:- Looks and feels like a Moleskine- Looks enough like a book or journal to disguise the Kindle- Looks nice on the inside and outside- Having a pad next to a Kindle is very good- Includes two reporter-style while slimmed-down MoleskinesCons:- No place to store a writing utensil- Won't fit standard Moleskine reporter books, even the soft cover ones (too rigid backing, too thick)- A lined journal would have been better- Feels like it needs another slit at the base to keep the journal from getting loose- Hard to get the elastic straps for the Kindle to look right",positive
"As a longtime Moleskine user, I was very excited when I learned they made a Kindle case.  I have not been disapointed.  It's a sturdy case that looks great and performs well.  It's the first Kindle case I've owned that seems to be a ""permanent living space"" for my Kindle, if you know what I mean.A few reviewers seem to not like it because the notepad is on the left, while the Kindle is on the right.  I can understand their reasoning, but I actually prefer it the way it is - and I'm right-handed.  If the Kindle were on the left, with the notepad on the right, it would be more awkward to hold.  For the few notes I take on paper, it's really no big deal to reach over the screen to do so.That said, Moleskine ought to offer both a ""left"" and ""right"" handed version if the case.  I would think it'd be easy to simply flip the design.  Then people could choose which version they wanted.",positive
"I purchased this because I was basically afraid to take my kindle anywhere without the case, and I love Moleskine notebooks.  The surface of the cover is soft... not like a normal Moleskine notebook.  The top left elastic strap does (minorly) interfere with the operation of the on switch.  It doesn't really bother me all that much though.  I have had mine for a week or two now, and it still has a chemical smell to it.  Be prepared to let it air out for a while.",positive
"I've been waiting a while for this cover, and it's everything I thought it would be: Moleskine quality, substantial feel, nice holder for the iPad, and a replaceable pad.  The only thing missing is a pen loop.Other vitals you may want to know:-- It's 1.375 inches in thickness with iPad loaded (that's almost an inch and a half)-- The cover doesn't appear to be leather, even though it appears to be leather.  Just like the notebooks.-- Interior is microsuede-- IPad is very secure in there.-- Spine is rounded, not square-- You can fold back the entire thing so it's flat.-- Not able to prop this thing up to view from afar (too slippery), and no prop is included.-- All buttons, ports, and speakers are accessible.-- Looks good, feels good.All that said, Moleskine made a mistake with their design.  While they include directions on how to flip the unit around to use it for leftys, when you do so, the ""cover"" becomes the back, and vice versa... and on your new cover, you now have an embossed Moleskine Logo--UPSIDE DOWN!It's bad enough they didn't bother with a lefty unit, but I can handle flipping it around (and having my iPad home button on top).  And I can handle that once flipped the strap works the opposite of all other Moleskine products (since back is now front).  But to have Moleskine expect me to start at their upside down logo all day is more than I'm willing to settle for on such a pricey item.  I'm ANGRY that I waited for so long for a product with such a silly flaw.I hope they fix this, but considering how long it took them to produce the case, and how late it is coming to market even after it was announced, I don't think that they will.  Too bad.  Could have been a GREAT product.",positive
"I'm starting my review over and changing this from 4 stars (I like it) to 2 stars (I don't like it).. At first I praised it highly based upon initial expectations., but now that I actually used it for work I'm seeing it may not be the case for me.I've tried a number of cases for the ipad from a travel case to the marware eco-vue to the otterbox. I always wanted one with a notepad built in and was excited to see the Moleskine iPad case. I placed my order on Nov. 7th and after nearly 3 weeks it finally arrived.Initial reactions, I like the case. It was thick and felt pretty solid. I liked the way the case held the iPad and overall the case seemed really well built. Now, I don't have ANY issues with the build quality. The case is built very well. And others have complained about the thickness, well I expected it to be a little thick since it now has a notebook with it. My measurement, it's just at the 1"" mark in terms of thickness.What did I like:-Construction quality, very nicely made.-iPad protection, the iPad is held very securely in the case, big plus.-Love that it has a notebook, unfortunately it's not a standard size which makes this a minus as well.-Looks professional. This is one of the best looking cases I have seen.My issue comes into the issues I found while using the case.First off, the volume and mute switch are on the inside of the case. This means you need to fold open the case if you need to mute or turn the sound down on your ipad. It's a minor inconvenience, but if I'm in a meeting and my calendar app starts shooting alerts it's nice to be able to flip the switch quickly then go through opening the notebook up and having to mute it. Now in most meetings I am actively taking notes but in other meetings I'm just a observer so when I am not taking notes this issue causes more of a distraction.Second, replacement notebooks. I have been searching high and low for replacement notebooks and cannot find any. I found some small jr. legal pads and tried those and yes they work, but they don't sit as securely in the sleeve like the moleskine brand pad is and I think this could cause to ripping or sagging of the fabric. I think you are going to need moleskine brand pads or risk ruining the fabric sleeve. This is just a guess. And since you can't at the current time buy replacement notebooks you are out of luck once you run through the initial 50 pages.Third, no pen loop. They give you a notebook and a spot for your iPad, but nowhere to hook a pen. Yes I can carry a pen in my pocket, but you would think for the cost there would be a small loop to hold a pen or iPad Stylus like the pogosketch.Fourth, the true left-handedness of the case. The case can in fact be used by left handed people, but that causes a few issues. First off the back becomes the cover and now you have an upside down moleskine logo, plus the band is attached to the back so the sleek look is gone. Then my biggest complaint, the iPad is upside down when used in left handed mode so the home button is at the top. This also means the microphone is opposite the home button. So when the home button is at the top the microphone is pointed towards you. I use an app to record audio from meetings and take notes and when the iPad is faced the right direction this works flawlessly. When I use the Moleskine case in left handed mode the microphone faces me and in turn the audio is hard to hear as it is pointed away from the conversations.Fifth, no stand. It would be nice if you could somehow stand the ipad up but this case is really just meant to be used flat on it's back. It's not sold as a case with a stand, but come on, for topping the $60 mark you would think it would have one.All in all, it's  nice to finally have a case, built well with a notepad. But given the lack of replacement notebooks readily for sale for this case and no pen loop to carry a writing instrument makes it weak. I can use the case in right handed mode, but they sell it as left handed compatible and it really isn't as functional as it should be. They instead should release a second model that IS built for left handed and not make one unit semi-reversible.I may end up returning this case and going back to my marware. I'm going to keep using it until the end of this week before deciding..--UPDATE 12/9/2010--I have returned the case back to Amazon and have gone back to theMarware Eco-Vue for iPad. This out of all the cases I have use is the best for my personal situation. I wanted to like the Moleskine case but it just didn't work for me and I still can't find replacement notepads. Sorry Moleskine, perhaps revision 2 will be the one for me, but so far your case didn't meet my expectations.",positive
"I have read many reviews on folio cases for iPad. You will find ""the best ever"" in most of reviews that have got over four stars. So, I won't say the cliche, but want to say that I am very satisfied. Although I love my iPad, I'd felt sad as a fountain pen collector that my fountain pens are no longer useful. Then, I bumped into this case. What a wonderful idea to put Moleskine with iPad!Someone said in the previous review that it is a inch thick, and it is true. I feel like I am holding a book. However, it makes me feel that my iPad is well protected. The quality of paper is good as always, and it is very easy to flip over. Also, it also has the rubber band! Since I don't have keen eyes to see whether it is real leather or not, but the skin feels smooth and soft.",positive
"I have owned this for a month, hoping to use it in meeting situations where iPad typing and other forms of note taking doesn't quite get it. I was stunned to learn the tablets are not available with lines. Quite an oversight as they are overpriced to begin with. The cover holds the iPad in a fairly but not definitely snug manner.It is designed primarily for left handers with the plug and button holes oriented for the iPad to be placed upside down if the writing tablet is on the right side. No big deal for a right handed person.A note to Moleskin asking about future lined tablets was responded to with a trite ""go kiss-off"". A better product is bound to be offered soon from a more customer friendly, less smug company.",positive
"I have (had) one of these, different vendor, came w/ a 1 yr warranty...died at 1 yr 2 months. I was unable to find anyone who repairs monitors like this, too.  Great while it lasted, but reliability is unclear (search on yamaksasi monitor failure and you'll see a lot of them die at just over ~1 yr.  I suspect a blown cap in the inverter from the symptoms). Also runs unusually hot at full brightness (both the screen and the power brick get quite hot).  To be fair, it's a heck of a steal otherwise, and the image quality and speed are terrific (you must have a DIV-D input, not just DVI-I or any other format like dp or hdmi or VGA; DVI-D has a full rectangle of pins on the plug, not two groups of pins. Search on DVI connector and you'll see lots of illustrations of the types if you're unsure).  Great for spreadsheets, gaming, etc. But...it died prematurely.",positive
"I am a gamer and a coder. This monitor is great for both. Although i would like it a bit more with HDMI, it performs beautifully from my GTX 770 4GB DVI-D.",positive
The monitor has only brightness and power controls.  There are five other unmarked buttons that do nothing observable.  There is only one DVI plug.  The included cable worked fine for me.I am running the monitor on RHEL 6.4.  The monitor periodically (once a week) would forget how to transmit its EDID on reset from standby.  I ended up downloading the EDID from the monitor and setting up my xorg.conf to load from file rather than from the monitor.  No more issues.I'm using the monitor in a dual-head sitting beside and HP 30&#34; supplied by work.  The height on the HP is adjustable to exactly match the Yamakasi.,positive
"Since the resolution is great at 2560*1600 you can view magazine like HBR or Scientific America in dual page with crystal clear, flicker free. you need a proper placement on table since it cannot raise monitor up like my previous Dell 24 inch. The brightness and IPS performance so stunning. For Thailand friend, they send direct to your home and pay custom for 1700 B. Then this monitor is much cheaper than any 27 inch with same resolution selling in Thailand.Dr.PoonchaiBangkok, Thailand",positive
"MUCH BETTER THAN THE 1440p QNIX AND DESTROYS ALL 1080p.This puts all the 120/144 hz stuff to bed. Unless you play *seriously* competitively (and you probably do not), then 1600p IPS absolutely destroys 1080 monitors with much higher refresh rates. Those are ok monitors and just fine, but if you have the horsepower( r9 290 or 290x, 780 or 780ti can DEFINITELY max this baby, other slightly lower cards still work very well, as well as crossfire and SLI), get this.No dead pixels, GORGEOUS SCREEN, and a really good stand. Straight monitor with no BS features. It turns on. It's a boss. It turns off.",positive
"[[EDIT]]Now that I have upgraded my graphics card to a 2GB DDR5 card with a DVI-D port on it, the monitor gives me the full 1080p for movies and general resolution of 2560X1600. This was the problem. If you have a standard ""on board/integrated"" graphics card, then this monitor might not work for you.... you may not have a DVI-D port and it may not be able to support this hulk. On a different retail site, this company's recommendation was to have a minimum 1GB on your graphics card, and upgraded to a 2GB that is working quite well.I'm not a movie junkie but the colors look good to me. I have no complaints about the display.The monitor does run HOT though, which I think is typical for this style.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW, unedited:It came with no English manual, and no DVDs for drivers.Windows is running mine with the generic driver. The best resolution I can get is 1280X800, which looks horrific.I'm aware that the problem *might* be my graphics card, but this card is definitely capable of handling at least 1080p, and I cannot get even that. I actually can set it to 1080p, but I immediately get a black screen with colorful bar code gibberish.Can't get a setting for anything higher than 1080p, and definitely cannot actually use 1080p.I'm open to suggestions on how to fix this, especially if the seller is reading this. I'll bump this to 5 stars if they can help me resolve this (I will send an inquiry if I cannot get it fixed soon).",positive
"Here's what you want to know.The stand is FINE.  There are only 5 working buttons on this.  This is the power button, a brightness button(s), and volume buttons.  There is no other screens, setups, no calibrations, etc.  All of that has to be done on your PC connected to this.  It is literally a straight monitor.  As advertised, not 1 dead pixel.Resolutions excellent.There is a powerbrick with this item (just an FYI).  Haven't had any issues with it.To mount the monitor on the monitor mount, put the backend on first, then put the big base on the 4 feet, screw them in (recommend using a drill on a very low setting to affix it.  The DVI connector is a good length.I'd recommend it. Went from a dual monitors at 1920x1080 (24 inch) to this beast.  Night and day.  I can have two documents up side by side with room to spare (my girl reviews allot of documents, and she was liking this hunking thing too).  It is a ""Large"" monitor (comparable to a 30 inch TV).Yes the instructions are in Korean, who cares.  The box has the whole sparta theme on it, don't care either.  It is a good monitor, good response time, awesome resolution.I would do this monitor at 2560x1600 vs a 4k monitor for 4 reasons.1) 4k monitors are $1,000+.  Yes there are cheaper ones but there cheaper because...2) Most 4k monitors run at 30hz.  Basically it means that the monitor can only display 30hz.  THIS monitor displays at 60 hz (which is fantastic).  To clarify, essentially hz is pretty much how much fps a monitor can display per second.  Now you can have a 4k monitor but if your graphics card is kicking at 1000 fps, your monitor will only support 30 fps of it (its a dumbed down version of it but hz matter, and you want at least 60, if not more3) 4k monitors may require more than 1 connection (aka 2 dvi port connections) to run well.4) 4k is still reaaaaly new.  There working the bugs out regarding creating a gaming 4k monitor that isn't over $1000.This is a 30 inch monitor, well under the 700 to 800 pricerange of other monitors that do the same thing as this one.To the gamers out there, loaded up counter strike, awesomenauts, eve online, all ran at this resolution, full screen, no bars.",positive
"Very fast, dependable OS (way better than the wm5), good buttons, nice scroll device, good battery life, bt and wifi works very well, the only glitch is that it would be nice to have a better screen, other than that is nearly perfect.",positive

"This PDA came out in mid-2004, and it was a great PDA for this period.  Mine is still functional in 2012.I have had numerous PDA's; from the Palm M Series to HP's Jornada and IPAQ to a Toshiba and an ASUS MyPal A716. This Dell Axim A30 unit is by far - hands down - the most impressive unit that I have used.The unit is quite light and the display is very vibrant compared to the ASUS A716 (also still functional after all these years). It does not hang wile multitasking or viewing pictures - soft resets are few and far between.Even refurbished, these are very reliable - an all-in-one gadget for all your needs (I prefer having my contacts on a device that is not my phone). Shame that it does not come with a bottle and can opener or you would have a complete survival tool for urban living!",positive
"Never had one of these before, and I love mine. Limit, as far as performance--can't take an SD card bigger than 2G (no SDHC cards), and only runs Windows Mobile 2003 SE. Still works great for what it does. Can connect via 802.11b to just about any hotspot available, and plenty of apps still floating around the net for Windows Mobile 2003, but if you have the money, as I didn't, I would suggest the Axim x50, the last of the Axim series Dell made.",positive
"I bought this to go with my new Acer Aspire One.  I also wanted an external burner that is lightweight and small.  This one worked immediately right out of the box and is everything it is decribed to be.  Fast service from the seller with several pre-and post-shipping alerts from the seller, too.  A real pleasure.",positive
"I couldn't use this drive with ACER's Aspire One eRecovery utility but have determined it is ACER's software problem, not a problem with the drive itself.  But what I learned in trying to get help from cBear was that (1) they can barely write English, (2) their first strategy is to send you all of the pre-written scripts that have nothing to do with your problem and, (3) if you persist, they will express doubt that there is a problem but will (grudgingly) agree to let you return the product.  I didn't need to do that because the drive works with software other that ACER's eRecovery but note that returns subtract 15% of the purchase price plus you pay for shipping.  I determined that the drive I received is an unlabeled OEM Toshiba drive and that's a respectable brand.",positive
"I needed an external CDRW/DVD drive for my Toshiba NB205.The Acer Aspire One USB External DVD/CDRW CD Burner suits my need perfectly. For my purposes, a drive has to read and write disks reliably and quietly; that's it. I don't need it to be especially fast or to look pretty. Fortunately, for me this external drive is quiet, unobtrusive, and reliable.It has one eccentricity that I've found. It comes with two USB cables - one for data, one for power - and so you might find yourself in the position of connecting two USB cables from your laptop to this device. I do think it's weird. I've never seen this before.I've had no technical problems of any kind with this device. I am thoroughly satisfied.",positive
"Not much to say here. Good value. Works as described. A little bigger than it needs to be, but does the job.",positive
"I bought this because my COMPAQ DVD drive is not working too well. The External drive installed and seemed to do its stuff without any problems on WIN7. It comes with an extra USB cable to provide extra power to the drive if your primary USB port is not sufficient,On the ACER I use for streaming to my TV, it was just Plug in and use, no further installation was required, also a WIN7 machine.",positive
"I bought this drive to go with my Netbook, since netbooks are too small for a drive with removable media. I based my decision on size, price, and the fact that you do not need to use two USB cables to power this up. This plays CD's and DVD's as well as any internal drive in a laptop. I can watch movies, play music and install software. No big deal to pack it with the Netbook and take it with you. Excellent product, would highly recommed.",positive
I have had this for a couple months. Used it to load Win7 on a Acer Netbook. Worked just great.,positive
I just re-read the details of this product and still can not find any mention of the fact that this device is a READ ONLY device and will not create/burn CDs or DVDs.  I'm very very dis-satisfied with the product and with Amazon for carrying it.,positive
"I had no problem with my red DVD/CD player. I pluged it in and worked immediately in my three laptops.  I have a ten year old HP laptop that I don't use much, but I pluged the external USB in it just to see if it would work on an old one, and it worked fine. I bought this DVD/CD player to use with a netbook that I bought, but it has not arrived yet, so I can not tell if it will work in the netbook. If I have any problems with it I will update this review later on.",positive
Drive simply will not mount. I imagine this must be fine for the person it works for but I'm returning mine as non-functioning.,positive
"I must add this review since this is a great product at a ridiculously low price.I needed a CD/DVD player to install programs to my new netbook. Installation was easy; just pluged in the two usb cables and it worked immediately.I upload Microsoft Professional Office 2007 quickly and easily.  It does play movies, I played my Harry Potter Movie with no problems. The VLC media player was already installed. I highly recommend this player",positive
"This external USB DVD/CD drive is perfect for netbooks and laptops needing an external drive to handle CDs and DVDs.  The drive itself is slim and light, ready to travel with your netbook.  It conveniently draws its operating power through the connecting cord to a netbook or laptop USB port.  Assuming your laptop or netbook has a media player, you should be ready to utilize this drive right out of the box.  The drive is not necessarily ruggedized, so some care with handling is advisable. Highly recommended.",positive
This goes great with my ACER netbook.  I use it a lot to import things from other computers.  It makes things so much more convenient.,positive
"I use this thing way more than I thought I ever would. Great little product, can be a pain if your USB ports are to close together.",positive
"I bought the blue one for my son's blue Toshiba netbook, and it matches exactly. It arrived with two cables and instructions, but I only needed the USB cable. I plugged it in, the driver software loaded, and it worked! It's small and quiet, and works perfectly for a great price.",positive
"This external drive has helped me a lot, it comes in handy when your mac, notebook or netbook cd/dvd drive is not working.",positive
"I had a small notebook computer which had no internal DVD/CD drive so I purchased this. I have used it to run and install countless programs and not once has it ever given me trouble. I have also installed and played many games and it has a fast read speed and gets the job done in a timely fashion, I highly recommend.",positive
"I have purchased a small laptop (netbook type) for use as a large tablet.  It has a touch screen and Windows 8 installed.  However, it does not have an optical drive (too small of a footprint).  To load some of my favorite programs requires a CD/DVD drive.  This unit meets that need very nicely.  It is effective, quiet and seems to draw minimum power with just one USB cable.",positive
"I got this to use with a Linux based XBMC media center on a ZBOX as the DVD player. It was recognized out of the box. It plays DVDs great, until it just quits. I'll have to buy another drive as this one is not working for me.",positive
This drive was not recognizable by either a Windows 7 PC or a Windows 8 tablet.  Got similar item ($5 more) from Microcenter and it was plug and play.,positive
"It's okay and easy to use but feels a bit flimsy although I don't use it often, so I'm glad I have it. But haven't had great luck with DVDs and not sure if wrong type disc or what.",positive
"i bought this to replace another external drive that was only a dvr (i needed a cd/cdrw/dvd).  i opened my very carefully wrapped and packaged drive and was pleased to see that it stated cd/cdrw/dvd right on the front of it!  i was unsure of the 2 cords as well, but i plugged them both into my dell netbook, and it worked right away.  the only thing i don't like is that when you eject, you have to kind of pull the tray out.  it also seems just a tad sensitive if you touch it while it's working.  other than that, a great deal and good product!",positive
"I needed to get this external USB dvd/cd device, for a laptop I have that doesn't have a cd/dvd drive in it. I was very pleased when this arrived, and it didn't need any set up. All I had to do was hook it to the laptop, and it worked very smoothly and easily. This is a solidly good product, and for a good price, and so far it is working very well. However I felt that it is a bit sensitive to the touch when it is working, so the user has to be a little careful with it.",positive
I bought this external usb for my netbook and it works great for downloading programs. In fact I've been lending out to other family members. No complaints here.,positive
It works fine to play DVDs.  Haven't used it in other applications yet.  As others have said you have to download a media player if you have Windows 8.  I used VLC media free download.,positive
Sometimes cheap is good. You go a long way with your buck. With this machine I ended up spending more money since it malfunctioned ever since the beginning. My computer wouldn't even recognize the damn thing. I had to install a load of drivers and still it malfunctioned. I would recommend getting a pricier apparatus that is guaranteed working from the moment you plug it in.,positive
I like it but it does take a minute to come on and is quite a pain going from one science to another.  Other than that it is okay!,positive
"The description didn't say what brand the DVD drive was, so I assumed I would be getting a cheap Chinese generic drive. However, when I opened the package, it was a brand new LG drive! I was very thrilled to get that for only $25. The drive is very thin and made of aluminum. The drive features a slide-tray and works decently. I used it to install Microsoft Office 2007 and Star Wars Battlefront II on my Asus T101MT tablet pc without any issues. Plus, LG is a name-brand you can trust! I highly recommend this DVD drive as you get the best bang for you buck!",positive
"I bought this external drive when the built-in drive on my computer died. Buying an external drive was cheaper than hiring a computer repair person to come to my home and put in a new drive. The drive works OK, nothing spectacular -- it appears a little flimsy, but so far, no problems. I rarely use it, but bought it for those times when I want to watch a DVD movie or install new software that is delivered on a CD.",positive
Pros: Full system in a small case.Cons: having t use 2 usb portsto transfer and power system is a drawback.Overall a good external system,positive
"I purchased this player for my 9 year old daughters Acer Aspire One Netbook D255E for her to play DVDs, games and to load Norton 360 on the netbook.  Item arrived quickly in a box combined with other items from Amazon, simply wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put in the box.  There were no receipts etc for the shipment, and only a small booklet for installation on older Windows OS systems.  The booklet DID mention that the unit is a CD/DVD burner, but required additional software to do so (I checked on my Acer 5532 laptop after plugging it in and running a diagnostic check, it is only a DVD/CD player).  It also came with a USB driver disc which was unnecessary for my installation, and two USB plugs, one for media and one for power.  Simple to figure out though, just plug in both USB plugs and Windows 7 Starter did the rest.  However, like others with Windows 7 Starter, I had to download VLC Media Player to play DVD's.  No problem there, except for the additional junk that came with the Media player download which I immediately deleted. The CD/DVD player works great now, and sounds especially awesome on earbuds.  I have a Windows anytime upgrade from Starter to full home version ready to install, but I may return it now that I have this DVD/CD Rom working and the free desktop download correction fixed.Cons:  I was let down that so many others purchased the same unit and received a free upgrade to a DVD/CD burner.  That is not a real major setback since this is for a 9 yr olds netbook, but it would have been nice to have as a back up to our other burner.  One for all and all for one I say!Pros:  Easy,  I mean EASY setup.  Also found it nice that you do not need to utilize both USB cables, just plug in the media plug to the USB 2 and that is all required.  Great price considering the seller guaranteed it would work with my Acer One Netbook model.  Free shipping!!!!  Case seems to be sturdy enough, (just don't pick it up and turn it side to side while it is playing).  Region settings available, so it plays most everything.  GREAT DVD picture on both my Acer laptop and the Acer Aspire one netbook, very pleased!Overall,  I would recommend this to anyone needing a DVD/CD rom for the Acer Aspire One Netbook,  provided you do not want a unit for burning CD's and DVD's..UPDATE 01 March 2011:  The more I use this player the more I like it.  The picture on my daughters Acer Aspire one Netbook is sharper than the one on my Acer Laptop with widescreen HD. If you are an Acer Netbook lover, this is the external player for you.  Just a reminder, it is not a DVD/CD burner.Final Update 04-14-2011:  I finally upgraded my daughters Acer One Netbook from Windows starter to Windows 7 and the new OS picked up this player with no external help required for drivers etc.  I also upgraded to 2GB memory, (see my other reviews), which took all of about 4 minutes to accomplish!  My daughter is playing video games and watching DVD movies off this little player like there is no tomorrow!!  I am amazed that this player has performed as it has.  Total thumbs up for quality and performance!!!  I upgraded to 5 stars, simply based on the overall performance and lifespan thus far.  For the price you simply CANNOT go wrong!!!",positive
"This USB DVD/CD external drive works like a charm! Very simple to set up, have been using it with my iMac that does not have an internal disk drive. Computer recognized it immediately. The drive is very light and portable.",positive
"Item Description says nothing about this item being a DVD/CD R/W unit.  However after reading reviews, many said they were burning CDs with this unit so I purchased it.The unit i received installed easy and was identified in  device manager as a SONY CD-ROM DDU810aWhen I opened my burning software, no writers were recognized.Specs on this unit indicate writing function as N/AApparenty this company is shipping different items under this description as others have said that their unit was imprinted with DVD/CD R/wThe unit i received says DVD-ROMIts a nice external portable unit for playing CDs and DVDsTHIS IS NOT B A BURNER",positive
Basic dvd player for the computer. Plug it in and it works. So far so good.,positive
could not get my Acer netbook to accept this device.returned it .Eventually got a true plug and play LG  one--had much more luck,positive

"I use CR123A batteries like candy, I didn't know they were rechargeable till a colleague of mine happened to have a set. I quickly got on amazon and found this kit which has been a life saver. The ability to charge them either from a 120 wall outlet or a 12V car charger is invaluable, particularly if travel between countries..",positive
"Very powerful batteries, use it a lot and doesn't have to care about spare batteries, great price for the package",positive
"These batteries are good and so is the charger. For my husbands police small flashlight, this is great, especially the car charger!",positive
"This is a great kit, everything works as it should. Fast service from the seller. Didn't realize there was a car plug adapter included, this will come in handy.",positive
"I haven't had these long, but they appear to work.  Only time will tell how long they hold a charge and how many times I can recharge them.  Price was good though.",positive
"If you are like us, and you have tactical flashlites and night lights on your firearms, you know it is no fun to pay $10 for 2 to 3 hours of light. These pay for themselves in no time at all.With that said, I will repost if they fail early or quit retaining full charge. So far we have about 15 charges and recharges. We have had them for about 6 months.",positive
Two of the batteries never worked. I contacted them about replacements and they wanted me to jump through so many hoops I just figured it was not worth the effort. Lesson learned.,positive
"I needed a replacement battery for a Davis Weather Station, which uses solar cells to power the remote sensors.  After finding out that non-rechargeable batteries only lasted 2-3 weeks, the realization finally penetrated my thick skull that a solar cell won't do much for a non-rechargeable battery.  I bought this product, and am very happy with it. My weather station is happy again, the charger itself (which I've only used for the initial charge) worked quickly and without a hitch.  The product design is pleasant and fool proof.  I'm a satisfied customer.",positive
"The batteries work and the recharger, recharges. You cannot ask for more so this product has my blessing. It was also a great buy and saved me some coin so it REALLY has my blessing!!! Thanks for providing a great product at a great price!!",positive
"ORIGINAL: These batteries have been excellent for my flashlight and work four about 2 hours on Full Power.  Not much else to say except that these are great money savers for high powered lights like mine.UPDATE 9/14/2013:  These batteries are still running as strong as they were when I purchased them, so I have increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  They work great in my work light, Fenix TK35, which is a highly demanding power consuming unit.  I completely recommend these for anyone who is a LEO, EMS or similar line of work.",positive
"I made the mistake of abandoning my normal principal of ""you get what you pay for""I was excited to find these so inexpensively and had planned to use them in my SU-800 master controller for photography.  The ""quality"" batteries for this unit average around $16.00 each, so the idea of getting four batteries with a charger cheaper than the cost of two normal batteries was just appealing to my ""green sense"".Now I'm back to the single use batteries, as these rechargeable's let me down time and again...  when freshly charged, they often showed voltage ratings well above 4v and this isn't workable in my units.  So, I let them run down a tad and they are usable for a blink, then run down quickly under normal use.Also, if they are not equally discharged and charged in twos, the charger will show both charged, while they are not equal upon removal... one battery showing a voltage rating of 2.2 and the other 4.0 fresh from the charger.I consider this to be a real problem and potentially damaging sensitive equipment if using a battery that actually has a overcharged condition.  Batteries rated at 3 volts shouldn't show over 4 while in service.... and again, drain quickly.I should get 1000 cycles from my SU-800 by Nikon with a fresh battery... with these, it's more like 150-ishVery disappointed.I can't provide a review of how these batteries perform in other equipment, but if you need something that performs as ""rated"" with meaningful performance life, based on my experience with this group... please continue shopping for something better.Smart Charger-  charges unpredictably3.0V batteries hold unstable charges (based on my experience with those shipped to me)Charged life- very short, around 20% of that of a normal single use battery (based on the group I received)If you need something quick and cheap for equipment with a broad operating range, then you may get something out of these.  I just can't personally recommend them.Sorry.",positive
"I bought some of these to try with a light using 123 A's. They work as advertised. When you check them with a meter they show over 3 volts, but under load they do not hurt the light. Have been using them for a while now. Hold a charge VERY well, and no longer have to buy throw away 123A's.",positive
These batteries work flawlessly. The charger is why I dropped a star. Sometimes it doesn't recognize the batteries.,positive
"I bought these for use in my flashlights, Steripen Adventurer, and MSR MiOx.  The chargers work better than the solar counterparts but any use overseas you better take the solar chargers.  Still, they arrived quickly and have worked well every time.",positive
"I've had this kit for a few months now and have recharged a pair of the batteries 3 times, and a third battery once. So far everything works as expected. I use them in a Fenix P3D Premium 100 (Luxeon Rebel LED, 11 - 200 lumens), and a Fenix P1 CE (Cree 7090 XR-E LED - 90 lumens). For me the performance is very acceptable considering how inexpensive the kit was. I get maybe an hour to 1-1/2 hours total runtime depending which brightness levels I'm using. I don't use the lights for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time anyway so that's plenty of uses between charges for me.A nice plus is you get the car charger adapter included, too. Most kits require you to buy that separately at additional cost. Probably the only thing I would have liked with the kit is some kind of pouch to keep it all together. I made a carrying case out of an old zippered memory card/battery case I had hanging around. It just happens to all fit perfectly but it took an awful lot of finagling to make that happen!UPDATE 11-14-09I just wanted to update this review to say I am still using these cells and they are still working great. I think the runtime has improved after a few charge/recharge cycles (which is what is supposed to happen), so these are lasting even longer in my lights now. I only recharge them maybe every 4 months with occasional use of my lights. Still highly recommended.UPDATE 11-17-2010I guess it's time for my now yearly update on these batteries. They are still all going strong! I still only recharge them about every 4 months but that's because they have a very good charge retention and capacity.Another big surprise involving these batteries occurred over the summer (2010). I keep my Fenix P1 CE light on my keychain. To turn the light on and off you screw and unscrew the head slightly. If you unscrew it all the way the head comes off (that how you replace the battery). I guess the head had loosened in my pocket because one day as I was walking to my car I removed my car keys from my pocket. I stepped on something hard and happened to look down to see what it was. Well, it turned out to be one of these batteries! I had slightly deformed the top of the battery and ripped part of the plastic that makes up the case of the battery. I didn't have anything to lose so I trimmed off the plastic that was torn, and sealed the case up with some super glue. Fortunately, the battery still fit in the flashlight and it worked fine - still had a full charge! I've since charged it twice and it is still working great. STILL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",positive
Run time in my regulated JetBEAM flashlight was about 40% of what it should be with these batteries which were freshly charged. Well under powered and capacity. They're going to be replaced immediately with any battery other than this one. These batteries will see second string duty.,positive
This is exactly what I needed for my SU-800 wireless flash commander. It sure beats buying these batteries as often as I was. I definitely recommend it.,positive
"Got one for home, and one for the car.  Work great, but sometimes don't last as long as the non-rechargeable versions.  Great for training days for my tactical lights, as I can use one up and grab another from the charger.",positive
"After just two cycles of the batteries, they stopped working in my tactical flashlight.  I measured the voltage and found them to be almost 4.2 volts fully charged (when it is supposed to be 3.0!!!).  I don't know if this can damage a voltage regulated light, but I'm not willing to take the chance (they don't work in two separate types of flashlights I have anyway because they immediately shut off when turned on with these batteries now).  I'm returning these and buying some surefire non-rechargeable batteries.  What good is a tactical flashlight if at the exact moment you need it to work, the batteries fail?  And if you aren't using it for tactical purposes, then why get a light with CR123A batteries in the first place?Even when this charger WAS working (only on the first cycle), it got way too hot for comfort while charging and took way longer than it says.  Also, the light turns halfway to green but stays halfway red, and doesn't charge both batteries evenly.",positive
Imagine that you dont have to worry that you forgot to turn your flash off or it got flipped on in your camera bag. Imagine you never have to worry that your battery will die on you.And it came fast in great packagaing.Thanks.,positive
"I bought these to power my wife's first high output LED flashlight. They did work, but did't last nearly as long as I'd expected. The charger worked fine and we had no real issues with the batteries, we just weren't impressed.I ended up replacing each pair with a single Panasonic 3100 mA 18650 battery and have been much happier. We ended up giving these away, along with the flashlight to my step-daughter when we upgraded the wife's flashlight to something with a little more punch.",positive
"The right charge slot works fine, but the left one insists on flashing (indicating bad cell) when ever I use it, even with cells that charge fine in the right slot.  Since I only need to charge one cell at a time, I can live with it, but it's peculiar.",positive
Charges quickly. very good set for the price. will review more when field tested. using it for my tactical flashlight used for LE work.,positive
"I bought this for my iPod 2G. I wanted to take advantage of Skype calling my family. The mic itself is small, about as big as a horse pill or a paperclip to you youngins who don't know that a horse pill is any big a** pill you try to swallow...LOL I have a little pouch in my purse I keep it in so I don't lose it...because you will lose it. The sound was good when I recorded a voice memo. But you have to remove it to hear anything back. THAT's the kicker!It's a restriction of the device, not the mic. I thought I could use the mic to speak and my Bluetooth headphones to listen at the same time. No such luck. You have to get the iPod headphones with built in mic/recorder to do that. So all I can use this for is to record stuff and listen later. But it was cheap, so it's still a cool addition to my toys. Oh, and I also got the iPod headphones with mic... those too live in my little pouch of goodies...LOL",positive
"Worked well for my older iPods, but it was purchased to enhance iPhone recording. However, there is no increased quality or functionality with the iPhone over the built in mic.",positive
"Works as advertised.  A bit large, so interferes with plugging in usb charge cord.  And, of course, with this plugged in it turns off the speakers.",positive
"This little microphone transforms my iPod into something much more useful for recording events.  There is no way to listen at the same time, but that was advertised as such.  Thank you.",positive
I just got my mini mic and my Chill Pill Rapcap in the mail today.I bought both for my iPod Class 120gig for recording lectures. I didnt want to get one at a time to compare so I just bought both. My mini mic cost me $.34 and just under $4 shipping and rapcap was $14.50 and free shipping.I compared both for sound quality and distance at which they pick up sound. Turns out the only difference is the rapcap is white plastic spray painted pretty while the mini mic is either white or black plastic. Also the Rapcap is about .5mm smaller in diameter but same size in length. The caps construction is identical. Both work identical. Everything is the same. The only thing to test is durability but I'm confident it will be the same.So save the money and buy this one over the RapCap. They pick up sound great from a distance if you have it about 10 feet away from an instructor so just plug it in and stand it up near the instructors desk or sit near where he or she talks and youll be fine. I have a flip open case so I can plug mine in and stand it up so ill pick up sound great.Only complaint I have is that I bought the Rapcap too.,positive
"When I wanted to use my iPod to record some reminders to myself I looked around for a compatible microphone expecting to pay $25 to $50 or more and having a twenty page instruction book to study, but then I found this little gem at a great price and no instruction book to study and it works like a charm for me, just plug it in and go. I wish all tech stuff could be this easy.",positive
"We received our order in three days which was super fast.  The microphone that we received is actually white but that is not an issue for us. We put it on our 5-6 year old I-pod touch that our son plays with so that he can play all of his talking animal games.  Despite reviews that stated it didn't work because the I-pod thinks there are headphones in, we have not had that issue with any of our talking games  with the exception of the talking Angela game.  I put the mic in and rebooted the I-pod and it worked perfectly.  I thought perhaps I would have to remove the case based on other reviews but there was no issue there either.  I was actually ready to take my I-pod to the Apple store and see if we could have a mic added but this $3.00 dollar microphone was the answer for us.",positive
These work for the itouch 64gb but they sometimes skip when recording. You can not hear what you are recording. The sound quality is okay.. I did get this product fast through the mail.,positive
This products work for what i was using it for (an old iPod touch). I'm pleased but this is VERY easy to lose.,positive
Wouldn't buy this again.  I never really used the product because it didnt fit the phone that well with the phone case on.,positive
"i bought my mic from crazyfrog, not expecting that great of a mic due to the price. it shipped very fast, and i recieved it in perfect condition. it works just as well as, if not better than, my mic that came with an iphone. it works great with my ipod touch 2nd generation mc model. i would strongly advise anyone to buy this who's looking for a high quality mic at a low price. dont let those bad reviews scare you!! i dont know about the quality from other sellers, but crazyfrog delivered mine in perfect condition. great buy.",positive
"I gave this five stars because for the price, this tiny microphone is excellent.  I needed a small unobtrusive mic to record university lectures to my 3rd Generation iPod Touch.  I can report that this mic works perfectly.If you need fancy cut offs, filters, or you expect concert quality results, please go elsewhere.  If you want something that works well for much less than $10, get this mic or get a couple of them.",positive
"This mic sounds surprisingly great! It picks up a wide range of frequencies very nicely! My only complaint is that it is easy to lose, but there's nothing the manufacturer could do about that.",positive
"I purchased from 24hourdispatch-Global and it arrived quickly.  The microphone was readily accepted by my iPod touch 3G and allows me to make Voice Memos.  I also tried it for a Skype call and it works!  Note other reviewers have noted you can't both have it in the iPod touch to use as a microphone and hear sound from the speakers - this is a limitation of the iPod touch, and I refuse to give this item a negative review based on the limitations of the iPod touch like so many others have.  You CAN use it to make a Skype call, and both speak into the microphone and hear through the speakers if you set the call to ""speaker,"" either when making or receiving a call.  It's about the size of a very large pill.  I'm very pleased with the seller and the item.",positive
"Small, compact, easy to carry around.  Followed the instructions and it worked perfectly.  It's not a broadcast quality microphone, but for everyday voice use it's a great, portable solution.",positive
"Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...",positive
"When I bought my Itouch a few years back, I didnt like the fact that it had no mic.  So I started doing some searching here on amazon.com and I found one and still have it today.  i was able to PTT ( PRESS TO TALK) LIKE A WALKIE TALKIE AND OTHER stuff. I like it.",positive
Didn't work on my iPhone or iPods. Loved that it is compact. Wasn't out much money luckily. Do not recommend.,positive
This an awesome product.  It was cheap and works well.  I use it to record lectures in college so I can listen to them again.,positive
It works perfect. The only thing is it is so small. lol. like I think I have seriously swallowed medications larger than this device. Good item. Would recomend to anyone.,positive
I love this mic it works on itouch 3generation 8 gb so well. I love it too much and wat a money saver too . Nothing more to say but to order it soon!!!,positive
"Received this item today.  Plugged it in and thought that I should have read the reviews first. But there were also alot of good reviews.  So, I tried to think what was going on, plugging it in first it said ""no microphone"" when I went to my recording app.  I don't know if it did not go in all the way with the case on my Ipod, but I had to charge it and when I tried again with the case off, it did work.  IN ORDER TO LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HAVE RECORDED, YOU HAVE TO DISCONNECT THE MICROPHONE. Made sure it was pushed in all the way when I put the case back on.",positive
"This is a very good seller. The product arrived exactly on the estimated date of arrival. The only problem I have is that the mic has no speakers, so you need to unplug it to listen to the ipod again.",positive
I thought I could use something like this to enhance the tiny pin hole mic on my tablet but this thing is actually worse.  When doing a test recording the pin hole mic on the tablet was 5-6 times as loud during playback and the fidelity of the sound was higher from the built in tablet mic.  About the only way to could get anything to even register was to speak directly into the holes on this mic from an inch away.,positive
I needed this for my iPod Touch and also ordered a few extras because I lose little things easily. This mic has provided much use and definitely of better quality than I was expecting it to be. I've even recommended this to a couple of friends.,positive
"sensitivity is slightly on the low side...records loud static noise every three seconds...otherwise, it's a good product...",positive
"This item works with an I-phone 4, 4s and a Samsung Galaxy S3.  The microphone picks up sound 10 time better than the built in phone mic.  The shipping time was a little long but that is clearly stated when you purchase it.  This lets you use your phone as a digital recorder.  I will buy another one",positive
"As a microphone this thing works fine. However if you are trying to turn your itouch into a skype phone forget it as the volume on itouch just isn't loud enough. I have found out that the only way to use the itouch as s skype phone is to use the headphones that include a mic. And then if you have skype in, forget it because you will never hear the thing ring. But the mic works and it is little money.",positive
Good product does the job. Good price. It has a carrying case. I used for the ipod  does a good job.,positive
"this is a fantastic tool if you are recording anything from Business meetings, you can even use it for the app Shazam... it really cool. not for use for the voip though...",positive
"This microphone does what it states, but nothing more. It does record sound, and that can be very handy for an iDevice, but at the cost of the external speakers (if it has one) being shut off. The original reason I bought this was for the use of Skype, but I can't due to the speakers getting shut off. Also, the size can be helpful (not a obstruction), but it is also easily losable.PROS-Records sounds-Compact**CONS-No speaker when in use-CompactIn the end, buy this if you need it for the voice memos, shazam, an certain voice apps, but with other applications, such as Skype,this won't do very well.",positive
"It's simple and works well for me. Sellers say you have to purchase an additional app, but mine works fine with the included 'Memo' app on my iPod Touch 2G. Down side is that you have unplug it to listen to the recording.",positive
I use this product all the time since I am on Voxer.  I needed a microphone and this product is great because it is small and not as noticeable.  I really love it,positive
Nice add on for those who have an iPod Touch.  Not a miracle worker but provides microphone capability.,positive
SD Ultra Micro SDXC card has worked without flaw so far.  It's been trouble-free up to this point in transfering and managing all my audio files (~29GB) from my HP laptop to my Samsung Note 10.1 2014 Edition.  I've also purchased compatible SD micro cards for my Samsung Galaxy III cell phones which have worked out better than the Kingston cards that I had originally purchased.,positive
"Just got back from a week in London and Paris. I used this adapter to power my HP laptop and I used it's built-in USB port to charge my Blackberry Bold, iPhone 3GS, and iPod Touch with no problems at all. The built-in lights are really handy. The power light lets you know it's plugged into a working AC wall plug. I found that not all plugs in the Chicago and Houston airports are working, so having the light was really handy for finding a working outlet. The second, USB, light gets brighter or dimmer as power is pulled by the USB device. For example; when my Blackberry was plugged in and recharging, the light glowed somewhat dimmly, but when I made a call, the light glowed more brightly. So you can tell when you have a good connection to your USB device.Overall, it's well built and easy to operate. I'll be keeping this in my travel bag.",positive
"Ordered Sept. 2012 from another company on Amazon for $5.24 which included shipping. I sent it with a gift to someone in the UK.Item is finished well, the different interlocking plugs cleverly designed and fit together snugly. Came with instructions and carrying pouch.Only trouble I had when testing it here before sending it was pushing my computer's power cord plug into the AC receptacle. Very difficult at first to force it without it seeming it would break but after many tries finally got it.  Much easier after that.The USB slot and its light worked, but the second light for the AC receptacle did not. However, the receptacle worked fine and charged my computer through it.The USB light did not go off when the device charging through it was fully charged. Also, another switch was shown in the instruction diagram (I don't remember what it was supposed to be for) that wasn't on the adapter.Recipient uses the USB slot to charge a camera and MP3 player and reports it is working fine for those devices. Thrilled to have the EU plug too.If it lasts, great product and VERY cost effective.",positive
"I purchased 2 Universal Travel AC Wall Adapters, with USB Charger, for my daughters' trips to Europe.  Both units worked for about 1 day or less, when they stopped working during use.  They used them with dual voltage camera battery chargers.  I had also given them straight plug adapters.  Thank God that I did!  The straight plug adapters, which I bought in 1999, still worked, and lasted them the rest of the trip.  Good thing I also included USB charger units.  So they could not charge 2 items at the same time, since the new wall adapters broke, but they got their gadgets charged with the other plugs.I put in a request to return these to the seller (HandHelditems).  And they did NOT honor it because I bought it a few months back, but the kids' trips were not until the past few weeks.  I guess I should have tried them out after we first got them.",positive
"This product does NOT deserve the 2 stars the other reviewers gave it.  One reviewer got the wrong product, apparently (which has to do with the seller), while the other doesn't seem to realize that the USB port is for charging peripherals, NOT a computer.Pros:-has basically all plug adapters you need built-in or easily removable.-compact-sturdy, good quality plastic, kind of like Lego-decent USB power port rated at 500mA-lights for AC Power and USB powerCons:-does not ground-instructions say 110V-250V, but unit says 100-250V. Should work in Japan, but haven't tested it.Notes:*Do not pay full price at a retailer for this item! I got mine from the seller in this listing. It was delivered in a simple bubble-envelope with instruction sheet, no maim-shell packaging.*I LOVE the lights on this thing.  You can plug in and know right away if there is AC.*Furthermore, the USB lights up depending on the current being drawn and thus flickers when something is trickle-charging.  Know what this means? It means you can tell AT A GLANCE if your device is 95% charged!!! Do NOT top-off your battery-powered devices to 100%! The ""memory effect"" is a myth.  The real culprit is topping-off your battery.  Charge your devices until the USB flickers and then remove them.*keep in mind that, as with all modern plug converters, your primary device must be rated to use 100-250V mains power.  This adapter will NOT step-up or step-down voltage (unnecessary with modern electronics).The only possible improvements to this would be if there was an extra USB port or if it was somehow rotatable.This thing kicks ASS and is a great bargain compared to the other name-brand junk out there that is either over-priced or over-priced AND doesn't have USB power.",positive
"These are great, the USB port is especially handy. Small size, and all the adapters I could want. At first it seemed to light to do it's job but it is working great. It is the only adapter that I use when travelling.",positive
"This is very handy and it charges two things at once easily. I usually charge my laptop and iPod touch in this at the same time and have not had problems with it so far. It also has all of its individual parts for the various plugs it is capable of fitting in all contained within itself, which is very handy because you don't have to remember where you put the EU plug or the US plug, etc!",positive
"These were a life-saver! I bought 2 of these and I was a little unsure of the quality based on the price of this item, but was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked for me over 6 weeks in Europe and UK.  Stayed in over 22 hotels and on a train sleeper car and never had a problem.  I travel with a CPAP breathing machine and it was critical to have power every night so I could sleep.  I also had an iPhone and my brother had an iPad and the USB charger was great for both.  I could also use one plug to both power the CPAP and charge the iPhone.  It was really nice to have the red lights that indicated that you had power since many outlets in Europe and UK have some sort of switch that turns the power off to each individual outlet.  Also, on the train, the red light wast coming on and let me know that the outlet wasn't working.  I worked with the conductor to get some circuit breakers on the train reset by letting him know when the red light came back on.  That was quite a time saver and great tool for that purpose.The only negative I have is that the part that holds the US plug into the device could be a little more snug.  It felt like it was going to fall out at times (and did fallout 1-2 times but that wasn't much over 6 weeks of use).There is one design enhancement that I would have put into this device: When using the UK converter, they could have made the bottom of the device a 2nd 110 outlet so that you would have 2 110 outlets (the regular one on the back and one on the bottom using the Euro converter) as well as the USB outlet.  Of course this may be over the amperage that one plug should carry, but it's a thought for the designers.",positive
"Product was shipped quickly from Toy 4 Kids. At first, I loved it. It's compact, has all kinds of adapters, and very lightweight -- seemed perfect for travel. My first night in Italy, it plugged right in and charged both my camera battery (in regular outlet) and ipad (using the USB port). Unfortunately, after the 2nd night, there were faint black burn marks on the white plastic and it failed to charge anything else after that. Burnt out after just 2 nights?  In short, great idea but very little durability.",positive
"We are heading to Europe this summer.  Of course, we'll have an array of electronic devices with us (camera, kindle, phones, etc.) and I wanted to make sure we could keep things charged as needed during our trip no matter where we ended up.  This is a perfect solution at a very affordable price.",positive
"Once upon a time I travelled with a heavy current converter and a handful of plugs to fit a variety of sockets outside the U.S., all in a bulky case.  Now that so many electrical devices have dual voltage, the issue is to find a convenient plug adapter, and this one fits the bill.  It's very cleverly designed so that all the plugs snap together into a single compact unit - no more lost parts! - and it has the added benefit of a USB port for charging MP3 players & the like.  Add to that a super-reasonable price, and I don't know how you could ask for more.",positive
It is good and as expected. I love to have it with me for my international travel.I love it.,positive
"This adapter is a very good investment. I've used this in Europe, Korea, Ethiopia (Africa)and the U.K. and it has not missed a beat. I really like the extra USB plugs. They work so well that I no longer carry an extra AC to USB adapter. It does have an internal fuse that cannot be replaced, but I have yet to encounter a problem.I plan to get another one.NOTE.. This is only an adapter, not a voltage converter. Most outlets outside of the USA are 220. So be sure what you plug in is duel voltage. Most cell phone chargers and laptops are duel voltage.EDIT: I've uploaded some pictures, please feel free to view.",positive
"We have two of these and recently used them in both Ireland and Sweden. It includes plugs for UK, US, European, and Australian style plugs. Contrary to what one other reviewer says here, it does really support Australian plugs. To use it on an Australian outlet with the angled slots, just twist the blades of the US plug.The fuse in one of ours was blown while trying to run a hair dryer on it. I have removed the fuse and ordered replacements. When I get it working again, I'll post an update. It is marked as a 3 A, 250 V fast blowing fuse, which means that this is rated for about 750 W. That's about half the wattage of a typical hairdryer, so hairdryers on one of these are pretty much out of the question, but it's more than enough power for charging any kind of electronics that a traveler would carry.The red indicator LEDs are helpful to know that it's working, but they are fairly bright, so if bright LEDs in a small hotel room are a distraction from sleeping, plan ahead to cover them up with something.Update: I replaced the blown fuse with one of these:QUALITY USA brand fuses!! Set of 5 pieces, 3AG3A250V, F3AL250V, F3A 250V, F3 L250V, F3A 250V, F3L250V cartridge GLASS fuses 6X30mm (1/4 in x 1-1/4 in) , 3A 250V, Fast-blow (Fast Acting). Everything appears to be working fine, and I now have 4 spares to take with me on my next trip.",positive
"I'm in Europe right now using this, and it hasn't let me down. I use it every morning to heat water with a immersion heater I insert in my coffee mug to make coffee each day. At other times I use it to charge my kindle, backup batteries, camera and cellphone.I wish I had purchased 2 so I can use more than one outlet at a time. I did bring along an extension cord, but adding more than one gadget to it slows down the charging rate. Using 2 outlets is more efficient. I'm buying an additional one for my next trip.Highly recommend this one, as it is very versatile with the USB port.",positive
"Great product but is not true as they say that it charges ipads, it does not charge them at all, i would rate this a perfect 5 stars if it did, its a pitty.",positive
"There's not much to say, other than that the price was exceptional. The adapter set is compact and appears durable. I really wanted the USB charger plug, and figured I might as well get a complete adapter set into the bargain.",positive
This is a cable.  It allows power to be transfered from and outside source to my Nexus 7.  It functions exactly as advertised.,positive
"Cord worked great for awhile, but had recently not been working up to snuff. Can't understand how a cord like this can go bad in three months. It should last a lot longer than that. Won't keep my tablet fully charged when connected to the docking station. Switched back to the OEM cable, and what do you know? It's charging again.Definitely going to have to find a different cable.EDIT 10/1/2013: Nope, the cable is fine. It works great as an OTG cable...I was able to load pictures and sound effects onto my work phone, as well as add files to my Nexus 7. It was actually the cheaply-made $9 Chinese charger I had purchased to use as a backup that was going bad. When I put this cable on my Nexus' OEM charger, it worked just fine. I do believe I'll be purchasing another Nexus 7 OEM charger in the near future.",positive
Described as a better cable than the one that came with the Tablet. Not so! Mini USB doesn't fit and cord is very short. Sending it back ASAP.,positive
"Original Review: This cable does the job but beware if you are looking for anything longer than the ASUS brand cable that came with the Nexus 7 It's the same length. But the price is right and the cable seems sturdy enough.Update: We recently made a trip and I took this cable along, along with the original ASUS charger. Big mistake! As noted in other reviews the cable was incredibly slow in charging my Nexus 7. I left it plugged in overnight and it was only at 22% the next morning. When I returned home I tried the charger with this cable and found that after 10 minutes the batter charge increased from 85% to 86%. Using the same charger and the original ASUS cable for the same 10 minutes, the battery had increases from 86% to 89%. I left the Nexus 7 connected to the charger with the ASUS cable and it reached 100% charge after about an hour.The cable works fine for copying music and image files back and forth from my PC but it is sorely deficient as a charger cable. Ergo the downgrade in my rating from 4 to 2 stars.",positive
not worth your stress...fit loosely from the get go...I have two nexus 7 tablets and it was the same with both. went to wal-mart and bought a cheap generic one and it works great.,positive
"It looks just like the real thing, however it does not hook into the port as well as the original one. Not a big issue considering the price.Google is selling those for way too much, they will not get my money for such overpriced item.",positive
"This cable is fine, except for the fact that there is no rigid construction to keep the male end from bending. I dropped my nexus 7 from a height of 1 foot onto my bed and it bent about 45. Your best bet is the official nexus 7 charger, but beware, the USB and the cable have almost entirely seperated on the cable that came with my Nexus 7.",positive
"A big improvement from the stock cord provided with the device, liked it so much I am going to buy several more,because I take my nexus everywhere",positive
Perfect additional memory for my Samsung Galaxy 4 smart phone.  Easy to install and transfer data.  Could have not asked for anything better.,positive
"I bought 2 of these thinking they were somehow specially formatted for the S4. I suppose I was naive. I could have purchased the same item, for less, with the 'special format.Yes, good product and works fine the phone. Special? No.",positive
She put it in her Samsung Galaxy 4 phone to be able to hold more pictures and data and hopefully not lose it if she breaks her phone again,positive
"Now so far I've only tested it out on a computer as my tablet has still not arrived(shipped out a week ago). So I will update when I get to test it out on the tablet as well. It works great, a bit slow in transfer items from my computer, but that's to be expected on my old laptop, so no problems there either. 16 gb, only 14 can be used on mine, but that is still more than enough space for me, since I only plan on storing apps, and ebooks on it, along with a few movies(maybe). Will look to buy this again if I need more room, or if my mom needs one.Update: Received Tablet today, and popped this in, works great, reads really fast! Great for holding my books, movies, and apps that I don't want taking space on the tablet.",positive
"My last memory card for my Galaxy S4 got some water damage on a camping trip a few months ago, which became apparent when all my photos became inaccessible/got deleted. I needed a fairly large and reliable memory card to replace it. I've had this microSD card for a few months now, and it has been great! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable way to store data, especially photos on the Galaxy S4.",positive
"I bought this for my son's GoPro and it's worked out great. I just wish I would have bought the 64gb instead of going cheap on the 32gb, but so far so good. He's a couple of months into using his camera with this card and no issues.",positive
Purchased this after the purchase of a camcorder that required it and would not work with a 16gig. Got the smaller card at local store because of price and wanted to compare Amazon first. Haft the price of buying it local so was worth the wait. Was in my hands a few days after ordering and would recommend that one at least look here before paying the box store price.,positive
This card is very good. I use it in my Gopro because that need a fast writing and reading. I recommend it.,positive
"I needed a class 10 card for my GOPRO and this one looked like the best deal for the size ,and I have always liked the Sandisk brand .",positive
The micro sd card worked with no problem whatsoever. The adapter that came with it did not work at all. Luckily i had an extra.,positive
This card works well with my GoPro. Lots of storage space in a small package. The price was fair for a SanDisk product.,positive
Bought this for my new Gopro and away we go. Great SD card at a great price...love it love it love it.,positive
I liked it. I is already formatted and no need for formatting it. My galaxy s4 recognized it easily and easy to use. The only reason I gave 4 star because it is not 32G as stated and it is only 29g. I don't know if that is supposed to be or not. I am happy anyway and would recommend this sd card to every body . You won't never regret .,positive
Very High Quality and what a deal! Fast shipping. I trippled the memory on my Galaxy S4 for only $22.90  ship. Anyway now i can have all my music and videos and pictures on my new external memory and my phone runs great. I have the Samsung Galaxy Gear watch so I needed more room to install programs for the gear. Awesome deal!,positive
"this is OEM from Kingston.  i've had other data storage items from them.  all good.  this one, too.  have not used the adapter.",positive
"Bought this since it said it was specifically formatted for the Galaxy S4, and for the first 2 months it was working fine.  Bought it to replace a SanDisk 64gb MicroSDHC card that was prone to have problems.After approx 2 months, the card stopped reading in the phone.  I tried other cards and they worked in the phone.  The Kingston MicroSDHC card was dead and will not even read in my laptop or desktop computer, using different SD card readers.  I can't format it, can't even read it in the Disk Management viewer, and can't do anything with the card now.  Thousands of pictures and videos are now lost and that doesn't make me happy at all.  JUNK card.FYI, I put the 64gb SanDisk card back in and that's been working great ever since.",positive
"This is a good, inexpensive option for my camera. It works perfectly. Amazon sells it for less. Kingston is a reliable brand.",positive
"I FINALLY have more than enough storage on my phone...more than I will probably ever need!!If others are like me, they save zillions of graphics, apps, pictures, videos, etc....and the constant warnings on my screen that I am almost out of room drive me crazy! ;)So...as much as I can, I add to my SD card & voila! no more warnings...even after all that I have in there, I still have between 28-29GB of room open...I don't think I will EVER be able to use it all up lol.Shipper was fast & the price was not too bad...so glad I ordered this card!!! :)",positive
Slipped right into my Galaxy 4S and was able to transfer all media from my previous card to this one. Allows me to use my phone without worrying about running out of storage.,positive
Fast delivery.  Works as described and does the job. Kingston reputation was final decision maker.  Would buy again.  Using with Samsung Galaxy S4.,positive
"I used it for my Galaxy S4 for a good 6 months without any problems. And just today.. It's died. Won't work at all, can't recover any files, can't even format it to re-use it. It is now a worthless tiny chip... Thanks, Kingston. Won't be using this product again. Any one else who plans on using this for a phone, especially a Samsung, I would recommend you buy Samsung's brand for the SD card. I should have done that from the start, but I wasn't even aware they made an SD card brand at the time. (I should have known.. Samsung makes everything!)",positive
"I bought the 32 gig. card for just that purpose, My Samsung phone, takes as good pictures as most cameras. In fact I like the camera feature better than all the other stuff on the s-4. I would buy it again and again if I needed a lot of memory. I recommend this item to anyone who has run out of memory for pictures or any thing that needs to be stored out from the internal memory of the camera. I like to take moving photos with my Samsung, and those 8 second runs take a lot of memory, now I don't have to worry and running out of memory",positive
We bought two of these micro cards for my wife's new Samsung Galaxy 4 cell phone since she takes a lot of pictures and we wanted a second micro card for backup.  All I can say is that the card works well in the Samsung cell phone.,positive
Fit inthe phone and worked fine.  It is tough to get enthusiastic about memory except as one ages and loses theirs.,positive
Nice pack. Installed easily in my galaxy S4. Works great.. Instead of paying $100 for a 32gb phone get a 16Gb phone and add the SD card...,positive
"Ordered this to leave connected to an HDMI port on the upstairs TV so my wife could connect her tablet to the TV. It works great and appears well made and should last a long time, especially where only the mini-HDMI connector will the inserted and removed multiple times. No issues with it being loose, weak, or ready to break. Hard to beat the price with a nominal shipping charge. It arrived in its own bag inside of a shipping bag in perfect condition, and the shipping was exactly when they said it would be.",positive
Digital works or it doesn't (despite Monster Cable's hooey). This works and the price is right.,positive
This cable for under $7 was every bit as good as the ones sold in camera stores for $40+ dollars.  I'm very happy with my purchase.,positive
The cable works as advertised and the price is unbeatable. I am not using it for a camcorder but for a canon elph camera with HDMI out. The photos and videos look great,positive
Bought this hoping it would be as good as the $20 one at Staples. For the price...why not try it? Works great. No graininess. No interruption of transmission. Perfect length for my purposes. They must have just had an abundance and wanted to get rid of them because they are top quality.,positive
"Just to give you a brief history, I had contacted CITI electronics before buying this product, if it is going to be compatible with my Canon HF200 video camera. Their response; YES. Considering how much the original one costs, I went the cheaper route; and it bit me right back. THIS CABLE DOES NOT WORK. Citi electronics lied (Just another California bases electronics retailer selling Chinese junk). Now, they expect me to pay for shipping even if the product is defective. Wonder if Amazon even goes through a selection process anymore. Overall, a very very bad experience. Never buying anything from Citi electronics again. Will have to buy original canon cable. There should be a way of actually making it zero star.",positive
I needed an hdmi cable to connect my camcorder to the flat screen tv.  Did not wanted to hassle and see it on rca cables.  Cables work and were cheap.,positive
Prompt shipping. On time delivery. Excellent quality cable. Tested using my Canon SX 40 and it worked really well for images and for video. Good buy and great price.,positive
What pay $50 for a Canon brand cable when you can get this one for under $10 and the quality is just as good. I highly recommend this mini HDMI cable.,positive
this cable lets me show pictures and videos from my camera through my TV monitor.  Easy to use.  Clean picture.  It does what it's supposed to do.,positive
We use this cable to hook our camera to the RV TV.  Works well and is long enough to be able to see at a table and operate the device.  The photos look nice on a large screen.,positive
"Can view my pictures right from my Cannon 4Ti on my big screen TV with this.  It works great, but be sure to follow Cannon's directions.  You must have the cable connected and have the TV on before turning on the camera.  It is great to look at the pictures on the big screen before downloading them so you can pick the good pictures.",positive
"And I like the length....makes it much easier to make the connection between the cfamera and the TV.  My TV is mounted high on the wall, so length is essential if the camera is not to be dangling.  I haven't yet used the cable, but it appears to be strong and flexible.",positive
This HDMI cable is perfect for sending image and video from my digital camera to my HDTV. Being told that it isn't necessary to spend outrageous money on HDMI cable has proven true. I now have several inexpensive HDMI cables that work perfectly. I would purchase additional cables from this seller in the future.,positive
Works flawlessly to connect my new Canon camera to all the HD TVs that I have hooked it to.  Great pics and vids and sound.,positive
Works just like my shorter cables only with more optional length.  A good price for adding distance flexibility for camera to TV hookup when viewing pictures.,positive
"The cable is doing just what it is suppose to do. The connectors fit snuggly into the HDMI input on the TV and the output of my Canon 5D, Mark II. Saved a lot of money vs. the cable offered by Canon.",positive
Just what I wanted to review photos on my camera via my HD TV.  I can sit across the room from the TV and get an excellent view.,positive
"Works great to connect my Canon 60d or t5i camera to an HD TV. I directly connected it to two of my TV's and it works perfectly. When I connected it to a 3 port HDMI switch, it did not work. The price is great.",positive
"I found a tiny HDMI jack on my the Canon SX20-IS powershot and found no one had one in-stock locally and special order- I needed to take out a loan. This cable worked perfectly, no issues. Now my still camera can output full HD video/audio. Signal delivered without errors to monitor. 10 feet is a good length for getting around to the back of monitors or wall mounts.",positive
the cable itself is very flimsy compared to the OEM Canon.  Seems to work ok so represents exceptional value for money.,positive
Very good and normal quality. You can use it instead of originals. cheap. suitable for Canon SX40HS. I haven't more words but the site required more words so I wrote that ;),positive
"Simple accessory. Made well, good price, and the length is enough to give you access to a system from a table and run it across the floor.Clean audio and video. Good purchase.",positive
"I chose this one because it was the cheapest, under 4 dollars. I tested it today on my GE DV-1 video recorder and used to to connect to my LCD tv's hdmi port. THe mini hdmi end went in the camera and the large end in the TV. It worked fine. I will just leave it plugged into my HDMI port 3 all the time, so I will be able to hook up the camera to it for big screen viewing whenever needed.",positive
"Very good, working just as I wanted, plugged to my T2i, this is just what I was looking for.",positive
"As everyone should know, any HDMI cable should be the same besides a few minor differences in version so I bought this cheap HDMI cable rather than expensive lies at retail stores, etc. I have to say that I am very satisfied with this product. You get a long cable that you can connect your tablet to your TV and still have the tablet not too far from you. The sound and video works perfectly. I haven't tested anything HD yet like 1080p movies but I'm sure it would work.So I would recommend you buy this if you want an affordable mini-HDMI to HDMI cable that works and is long.",positive
Plug n play...resolution was awesome. Cord was nice quality did not feel like it was cheap. Now i can take the camera AND CABLE anywhere and plug it in.,positive
Premium Canon Mini HDMI Cable is a great fits for my Canon Camera.  It is good low prices for a long 10ft cable.  I recommend it.,positive
"its awsoooooooooome , i connect it with samsung LED and the picture is craaaaazy `mashallah` , i`m very happy becouse this produce",positive
"Just forgo the aftermarket cables for this. The form and fit are hit-and-miss, but the Canon cable is both durable and made so that using it doesn't block off any other ports.",positive
Glad this is available and at a decent price.  So many cables are overpriced just because the seller can get more for it.,positive
I bought this so I can show video clips taken with my Canon EOS Digital SLR on my flat screen TV.  Works great.,positive
THIS CABLE HAS GOOD CONSTRUCTION AND WORKS WELL WITH MY CANON 7D TO WATCH MOVIES FROM THE CF CARD ON THE CAMERA TO THE PANASONIC PLASMA HDTV.A GREAT PRICE FOR QUALITY AND THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF CABLE.,positive
I have a Canon Power Shot SX20IS. The mini plug of this cable fits the receptacle of the SX20IS perfectly. Great buy at a great price!,positive
Premium Canon Mini HDMI cable is a very good product for the price. So far it is working very well for me,positive
"This is a nice cable for a good price.  It works well with my Canon 300hs point and shoot camera, fits well and delivers a good picture.  Sent to me in nice packaging on time.",positive
"Given the rip-off prices of HDMI cables these days, what a pleasant surprise to buy this very functional, fully operational cable for such a great price.  It works.  It's long.  Perfect.",positive
"Great producct, great price, and very happy with it!  We used it with my wifes Canon T3i and it was nice to see the pics on our 55&#34; LCD.",positive
This HDMI Cable works just fine.  The price is so much lower than local retail stores.  I recommend the site.,positive
"I have this slot in my Canon 60D which states it is for a HDMI cable that can be hooked up to a HDTV.  It is supposed to provide a sharper picture so I thought I would get one.  Canon wants $50+ for the cable - no thanks.  On Amazon I found a cable for less than $4.00 - can you believe that?  It works great.  Sorry, Canon, but I have found the price of all your accessories way out of line.",positive
"It is not thin and light.  You can put it in your camera bag, so it is very portable.The pictures from my camera look awesome on my big tv.I am hesitant to give it 5 stars, because the first time I tried using it, it did not work.I had to pull it in and out of the camera a few time for it to actually work.",positive
"This cable works well with my T3i, this best thing is that it is 10ft. long so you don't have to be right next to your tv to review your photos and video....",positive
"Very easy for my father to use on his tablet. Literally, plug it in to an HDTV and it shows the image on both the tablet and the TV. As simple as that. No need to mess with any settings",positive
Cost under $4.00 shipped and works just as good as HDMI 6'length I paid $25.00 at Best Buy.No complaints here. Now I have a 10' so I can connect to the TV and still reach my lazyboy.,positive
What can you say about a cheap cable? It works well and doesn't break the bank. Comes with end protectors. I did not have any problems with using this to display the HD output from my camera to a large screen.,positive
Works great.  I lost the original and this one is perfect for my needs. Without it my camera is useless.,positive
"These cables are good. Not top of the line. However, they do get the job done and seem to work well with my DSLR.",positive
"Perfect mini HDMI and it's a real bargain! There are some HDMI cables that have a very high price range, but this one has a really low price and it works great! I am using this cable on my Canon 600D/Rebel T3i. The T3i takes 18 Mega Pixel pictures and I can now see them on my HDTV. I played back HD video on it to and there was no lag what so ever. Personally, this cable seems to do just as great as those other more expensive brand cables. I would recommend this mini HDMI if you are going to be using it for your DSLR camera. 1080P Capable!I hope this review helped you out.",positive
"I ordered this cable to use with my Ainol NOVO7 Elf II.  The cable was 10' as described and produces a flicker free, clear 1080p image.  Mine has rounded edges where the connectors meet the cable.",positive
"No problems running from computer to monitor, great value compared to other options and seems to be holding up just fine.",positive
Very stable for tablet to TV....love it. Pricing is best out there. Ordering 2 more. Absolutely love this for the price and function.,positive
"Ordered this little package for some real connecting,came fast enough for me to say.Hav'nt got the rest of my order to perform my hook-up yet,so being fast did'nt work for me this time(LOL)  THANKS FOR THE FAST SERVICE..........",positive
"Nice, economic hdmi cable. I got it for my mom to use with her new tablet. So she can connect it to the tv if she ever wants. It works just great. Nice and long cable. I was surprised how thin the cable was, but everything works fine with connecting her asus transformer to her led and lcd tvs.",positive
"This cable is pretty long at 10feet. There are gold plated connectors on either end. I'm able to control my camera with the TV remote via HDMI. So, why spend more money than you have to?",positive
"Worked great, no issues. I didn't realize it was 10' wanted a 6' but that was my fault.Cant beat the price",positive
I bought this for my tablet that has a mini hdmi port it works's excellent with my tablet the lengthily cable helps so that you can still control your tablet and this would be good for any other mini hdmi application you desire i definitely would recommend this product,positive
Arrived on time and as described.  Plugged directly from my Canon DSLR to my TV.  Pictures were clear and bright.  Great price when I combined this purchase with other cables I needed.,positive
"If you have a Canon camera with a port suitable for connecting to this cable... but this NOW.  For just a few dollars, you can enjoy HD pictures and video on your HD television.  Cable is nice and long for easy use with the TV.  I would recommend to anyone.",positive
"This 10' cable works great with my Canon T2i and my LCD TV.  Leaves plenty of room to reach the input on the TV and step back to enjoy the pictures.  Picture quality on my 46"" tv is amazing compared to the RCA video cord that is included with the camera.",positive
"Wonderful deal on a good length cable with no adapters required. I use this frequently for previewing on large screens, works like a charm.",positive
I used this to connect an older NVidia GTX460 video card in a PC with a low clearance backplate mini-HDMI port to me AV receiver on a home theater system. Cable worked perfectly with no issues!,positive
"The cable arrived quickly, and is well made with Gold Connectors .  This conversion of one smaller than the other also will fit most digital devices (ie) Android Tablets, Digital Cameras, Cellphones etc",positive
It seems to work ok to connect my TV with a Canon DSLR. . . . . . . .,positive
"this cable made it possible to connect my tablet to my big flat screen, so i could see videos better",positive
"Perfect length! Sturdy, and works as good as any other major brands out there. It's the best bang for the buck!",positive
Does what it supposed to and so far no problems. Length is good too as I don't have to be right in front of the TV.,positive
"All the new graphics card seem to be going to mini-HDMI or DisplayPort, I hooked this up from my PC to my 42 inch LCD HDTV and it works great, the display is fabulous! Playing games like Starcraft 2 is just awesome.",positive
"I bought this for my tablet (Ainol Novo 7A) which features mini HDMI out and the ability to play really high bitrate content, and 3D bluray rips.  I liked this cable because of the small profile at the mini HDMI end and I figured the thin cable would provide less strain on the tablet's port.Cutting to the chase - I'd get flicker on certain scenes during movie playback.  Always the same scenes, at the exact same time - so it wasn't a fit issue.  But the scenes played perfectly when I switched back to my old adapter and cable.  Also - I found I wasn't able to play big (20 gig+) 3D rips, when the other cable could.So . . . for most tablets and cameras this cable will work fine.  I suspect this cable will be fine for the Tegra 2 tablets (Original Transformer, Galaxy Tab, Acer Iconia, etc.) since playback is generally limited to 720P.  But if you play high quality video - it could be a problem - I don't know what the actual limitation is.",positive
"NOTE: This is an adapter to go from full size hdmi to mini hdmi, this is for digital cameras and other equipment with mini HDMI. This is not for cell phones and tablets that have Micro HDMI adapters like the HTC Evo, Motorolla Droid, Nexus 10, etc.Not much to say here, it works just as I expect it to work on any digital camera I've used. Plug it in and you're ready to view files on the big screen!",positive
Works fine when I use it to connect my android tablet to TV. Only used it 6or7 times but happy for now.,positive
"Canon wanted $70 for a similar cable, but I bought this cable for my Canon Rebel T1 digital SLR at this remarkable price.  The cable is spectacular and my images and videos are very clear.  The standard analog cable that was included with the Rebel is disappointing and there is a night and day difference between a digital signal and an analog signal.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.",positive
"I bought this for my 7D, it good, material seems ok, bit cheap, but it works. But I think it is still a bit expensive compared to same cables from MonoPrice.The thing is that I discovered that having a converter from mini and regular HDMI and a cable works better for me.",positive
"I ordered this as ""Sold by Cable Matters, Fulfilled by Amazon"" because of the Prime shipment and having received defective products from Eforcity previously. For less than five bucks for a 10' HDMI, as long as it works I'm happy. Oddly, if you go to the Cable Matters store, they have one for a few cents more with a different photo. I received one that looks a bit different from that photo and the one on this listing. The one received has very square-edged plastic around the connectors rather than the  rounded sides shown.It arrived in two days and fits my Lumix DMC-ZS15. Photos and video look great on my flat screen TV. So it does what I want, but appears a bit different from the photo.",positive
I bought this exclusively to use withCanon EOS 60Dand I happy to report that this cable works flawlessly with this camera.I was initially concerned about the quality based on the price it is been offered and also was worried that the extra length (10 Ft) would be an issue when it comes to signal degradation etc; But as the cable is of good quality I did not notice any sync issues or signal degradation.Having the extra length allowed me to keep the camera close to me on the couch and view the breath taking pictures and 1080p videos that theCanon EOS 60Dis capable of.It is a nice cable very good purchase!Highly recommended! - Get one to use with any device that has a Mini HDMI interface.,positive
"Tested this out to connect a MK808 Android stick to my Panasonic plasma TV.  Works fine, no problems I could tell.",positive
"plugged in my tablet - works fine.I haven't tested it on my DSLRs, but I'm sure those work fine too.",positive
"This HDMI cable got shipped the same day I ordered it. I was thinking it would work from my Canon SLR to my laptop to view photos after I shoot them, but it doesn't. I have a small lcd screen I use, and it works perfect...",positive
I bought this for the convenience of hooking up the HDMI port on my Canon camera to my HDMI tv. The length is just enough to sit back and scroll through your pictures (back and forth) at your own speed. Plugging the memory stick into the tv works as well; but you're stuck using the TV's slide show or other program to view.,positive
THIS MINI HDMI CABLE  WORKS GREAT WHEN CONNECTING IT TO MY DIGITAL CAMERA. I COULD VIEW MY PHOTOS IN HD WITH MY LARGE SCREEN HDTV.,positive
"This cable has simple small ends, not overly flexible or stiff.  Great value for the dollar.You can purchase with confidence.",positive
Perfect. Does what it says. Very reasonably priced. I use this cable for my Canon 5D mkII with various monitors and televisions.,positive
What can I say - it works at a fraction of the price Canon wants.  I would buy again.  Prompt delivery. Useful product to review photos on HDTV.,positive
"I needed a Mini-HDMI to HDMI cable to hook up my computer to my TV.  This is exactly what I needed.It works without any problems, and I've had it for awhile; and moved my PC / TV many times.  Good durability.",positive
"it works great, for a canon mini type slr, detected the camera and samsung tv with no problems, great price.",positive
Needed it so I can watch my recordings on the big screen instead of having to transfer the files on my computer all the time. Basically just got it to share fast and it does the job.,positive
I needed this cable to connect my Epson project to my laptop. Works great and the price made it a no brainer purchase.,positive
...you can buy this 10foot cable for such a great price? The length is great.  It allows you to sit on the couch or recliner and view your photos and videos in comfort.  I recommend this cable.,positive
"Got this to connect my 550 ti to my tv, and it works perfectly. Audio and Video are both delivered fine. It's good length, too. Not sure what else you could want from a cable. I suppose it's a little loose in the 550, but I'm not sure if that's the cable or the graphics card itself.Anyhow, let me know if you have any questions, I'll try to answer them!",positive
"This cable works well for connecting our camcorder directly to the TV.  It's long enough to allow me to sit a comfortable distance from the TV while using the controls on my camcorder.  The connectors on the ends are not bulky, and the cable is not unnecessarily stiff.  I can coil it up small enough to tuck into the camera bag while we're on the go.  We'll see how long it lasts, but it's working great for now.",positive
A cable runs lifetime. Excellent product that is no longer wearing and giving good care never going to hurt you. Product 100 percent recommended,positive
Quality of connection and video seems good with my Fujifilm F550EXR camera connected to my HDTV. 10 foot of cable really helps so I can sit comfortably in front of the TV at a little distance and manipulate the camera.,positive
I can find nothing wrong with this cable.  It works perfectly and has a great price.  I do not understand why the HDMI cables are so expensive at the brick and mortar stores.,positive
"Works perfectly at 1080p HD and in all other Canon EOS 7d modes. Costs less than 1/4 the price of the Canon equivalent. Expensive ""high end"" cables are a scam. It would be crazy to pay more. Tip: If you have never tried displaying your HD video or stills on an HD TV through an HDMI input, you will be shocked by the magnificent quality. Absolutely no comparison to the lousy pictures you got with the old analog inputs.",positive
"I was looking for a light weight cable to go from a small video camera to a hdmi video capture card in the computer. Used two of these cables on two jvc camcorders, and they did not transmit a usable signal to a video card in the computer.  Changed to a heaver-weight cable that worked fine.  I plan to try it with a canon camcorder, but I suspect it will work no better. I'll probably end up returning them.",positive
My daughter wanted this book and the price on Amazon was the best.  She has already tried one recipe a day after receiving the book.  She seems happy with it.,positive
I bought this zoku quick pop for my daughterr with her zoku quick maker. She loves it and have fun to make her own ice cream.,positive
"There is no shortage of pop recipes available for free on the web, but I purchased the ""Zoku Quick Pops"" book, because Zoku has some good recipes for fruit pops on its blog. I was hoping there were more where those came from. This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however. There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops. There is a ""Fresh and Fruity"" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled ""I Scream for Quick Pops!"", ""Bake Shop"", and  ""Coco Loco"". As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on ""Tips"" and ""Techniques"" are useful. There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual. The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners, tells you how to do different types of layers, how to add decorative fruit slices, how to do a quick shell, and how to make core pops. The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops. The book recommends using Zoku accessory kits, but you can do without.The pop recipes tend to go out of their way to be as sweet as possible. Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well. I've substituted it with no ill effect. On the bright side, many of these recipes may appeal to children, whereas most pop books that I have seen are geared more to adults. There are flavors like ""Cookie Dough"", ""That's a S'more"", chocolate peanut butter, and peanut butter and jelly. All 9 recipes in ""Bake Shop"" are inspired by cake and cookie recipes.As a resource for light, fresh-tasting fruit pop recipes, ""Zoku Quick Pops"" is very limited. Most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients. The recipe for Lemonade pops contains orange juice, which is fine, but the addition of vanilla extract kills the fresh fruit flavor. The recipe for mango pops includes orange, apple, banana and lemon, which are too many competing flavors. Mango and orange together make a terrific pop. The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes. Tips and techniques are also useful. For fruit pop recipes, ""Top Pops"" by Emily Zaiden is far better.",positive
"This book is a must have if you get a Zoku (which I also highly recommend). There is a large variety of recipes from simple, to fancy. The flavor combos are creative, and it gives you ideas for decorating the pops too. They turn out as beautiful as they are tasty. After reading it you will be inspired to create your own recipes too.",positive
"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others, but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far, but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one, and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also, it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended.",positive
"If you have a Zoku Quick Pop maker (or two....I have the original one-slot and then I bought the double-slot here at Amazon), I recommend you get this creative little book, which will inspire you.",positive
"This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow. It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup, 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen.",positive
"I bought this when I bought the pop maker. I think the recipes are fine, but there really isn't much in the book I wouldn't have figured out myself.A couple of good creamy recipes that are now available for free on recipe websites. As for ""pop embellishing"" well, that wasn't too hard to figure out, either. I'd save the money and spend it instead on extra pop sticks, which seem to disappear the way socks do....",positive
"The Zoku accessories are pricey, but the recipes have the exact amount you need to make the pops.  I have made it through 15 varieties so far, and I like them all.",positive
"High quality book. Clear and helpful information, and then some superb recipe suggestions clearly outlined. I can highly recommend this product.",positive
"This beautifully illustrated book featuring ten colorful,glittery butterflies is a favorite at our house. The nana-babies like to count the butterflies as they flit off! The book is also good for learning colors, discussing the activities the butterflies do and the plastic butterflies are great as the babies and toddlers like to touch them!",positive
I got this as a gift for my niece and she loved it. It's a super cute book and ill be getting it for any other nieces that may come along.,positive
"This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep. Each one is a different color, and each pair of facing pages (color-coordinated, of course!) tells the story of where each of the butterflies found to sleep. Each of the butterflies is shown as a brightly-colored, foil-looking toy that your little one will not be able to resist touching.My little one absolutely loved this book, and it did go great as a preparing for sleep read. The colors and the butterflies, and the cute story all were a hit. We both highly recommend this book!",positive
"This book is absolutely beautiful. A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations. Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color. ..., is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland. ...The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly. As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears. Each page mentions the color twice and an animal. The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old. The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies. A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again. I sometimes even read it to myself. The purple page is MY favorite.",positive
My daughter 1 year old really likes this book.  I bought it because of its similarity to the 10 little ladybugs book.  It has the same sort of colorful illustrations and I like it better as the ladybugs are not as pretty as the sparkly butterflies.  This book teaches colors as each of the butterflies finds a place to stay for the night.Update - My daughter is now well grown but this book sticks in my mind still - we read it so many times.  I would say it was one of her very favorites when she was young.,positive
"For a novice cake decorator who got talked into making her son's wedding cake, Wilton makes lovely cake decorating accessories to help with every step.  This book gave me so many great ideas and wonderful recipes as well!  This cake had a 16&#34; square base, 10&#34; sq middle layer and 6&#34; top layer all set 90 degrees.  For a first wedding cake, it was amazing with Wilton's help!  This book is a must have for newbies like me.",positive
"had no idea about decorating cakes,by this booklet ,now i can say that following the instructions and have the will and patience plus practicing,one day i wont be ashamed ofmy cakes. i added an image of a cake i made according to this book lessons, which i advice anyone who is interested; to get this book...",positive
"excellent book, shipped on time, packaged nicely, helpful tips in the book, good price. Very good experience, very happy with the product and vendor",positive
i loved it. don't use it much but when i had it's been useful. I recommend it to all who wants to learn how to decorate cakes,positive
"So I actually bought this thinking it was the entire Lesson 2 kit. However, I've found through experience that having the book without having to take the class is a good thing. I've taken the Wilton Lesson 1 class and the number of Wilton items you have to purchase ALONG with the Lesson kit is a little ridiculous. I've worked my way through Lesson 1 and now I'm working my way (by myself) through lesson 2. I recommend anyone that likes to work on their own time to just purchase this book.",positive
helpful information on decoraing basics. Good book for beginners who need step by step instructions and guidance. Good for all age groups.,positive
Got this for my girlfriend who runs a baking business and she said it was handy to have for a reference book. She said it is handy to have when thinking of decorating ideas.,positive
"This 128 page book contains pictures and patterns for 38 tiered cakes.  It gives you instructions on how to assemble cakes on stands, pillars or stacked construction.  It also contains recipes for basic scratch cakes in white, yellow, chocolate, strawberry, and banana.  It also has the recipes for standard Wilton Icings, fillings, glazes, fondant (not the tasty marshmallow kind), color flow, gum paste, and candy clay.  There are tips for baking, leveling, torting, filling and icing the cakes.  It also gives some instruction on how to cover a cake with fondant.  There are suggestions for transporting tiered cakes, calculating servings per cake and cutting guides.  The book also includes patterns and instructions for various decorations.  As with all Wilton books, the last few pages detail products you can buy from them to duplicate all the designs in the book.  The problem is that some of these items don't seem to be available on their web site any more.  The book was first published in 2005.  Still, it's a great idea book and I'm sure you can find acceptable substitutes for a lot of the items.  The book contains ideas for cakes that could be served at weddings, anniversaries, and showers.Also, I'm not sure if it's offered everywhere, but I'm currently enrolled in a class taught by a Wilton Instructor called ""Tall Cakes"".  It is taught in two sessions.  The first class is a demonstration by the instructor on how to put together a tiered cake.  The second class is where we bring in our own cakes and learn how to stack or pillar them.  It's less expensive than the other classes, no kit is required and the items needed are this book, one six-inch and one ten-inch layer cake, the plate/pillars, and our decorations.  It's a great way to top off the other four classes.",positive
didn't really care many of the cakes at all. not up to normal standing for wilton yearbooks of the past. the best cake is on the cover.,positive
I am very happy I purchased this book as it containes so much great information and time saving tips. I highly recommend.,positive
This book isn't much help if you are not taking the wilton cake decorating classes. you can get the basics but its really just a visual for the class!,positive
"I have always wanted to learn how to decorate a beautiful cake, and I purchased this guidebook along with The Wilton Pastry bag kit.  I appreciate how this guide gives tips on how to bake the perfect cake, and also gives detailed step-by-step instructions on how to use the pastry bag to make many different designs. I do, however, agree that this book did appear to be an advertisment for thier products, but the guide was helpful nonetheless.",positive
"This lesson plan is perfect for a beginner and definitely helped introduce working with fondant in a user-friendly way.  Thanks, Wilton.",positive
"Any person that wishes to learn the art of making beautiful, real appearing, fondant/gum past flowers - this is the book for you!! I promise your flowers will look SO real that it will surprise people. Each and every little hint that helps you to make your flowers appear real is in this book! You cannot go wrong with this book. You will find yourself reading it over and over, makign flowers over and over. You will see that your self-esteem will roar! People, co-workers, family members, friends will be dazzled and amazed -- and so will YOU.  This lesson book is extremely valuable. It cannot be purchased from Wilton (which is a real crying shame). I think Wilton is afraid that if they sell the book, they will miss out of selling classes, but not so.  I, myself, took 4 classes. Having bakes/cooked since the age of 9, I really didn't feel it was necessary but boy was I surprised. I learned more in my first class than I had in years of teaching. Wilton honestly needs to sell these lesson plans.  Not only will receive money from the classes, but they will also make money from the books.  Why would a company prefer their customers buy their books from someone else??? I've not figured that out.  Getting back to this lesson book...you will be extremely, extremely happy.  Your family will brag on you.  Your income will increase for making beautiful live-appearing flowers that you sell on your cakes. Please try it...you cannot fail!!! Best book ever on making and decorating flowers!!",positive
"It took me about 40 minutes to read this lesson plan thoroughly; while it is inexpensive at under five dollars, I still don't know if that is necessarily a good value. As some reviewers have pointed out, much of the book focuses on advertising Wilton products; without all of this the useful material in the book could have been condensed down to a couple of pages. I did like the photographs and the techniques for making different consistencies of buttercream for different uses. I had initially planned on getting the subsequent lesson plans as well, but I don't think it will be worth it. If you have any skill/experience with cake decorating at all, I'd recommend skipping this book.",positive
I love this booklet! It is light and slim so its easy to have around and it has great pics to reference to in a hurry.,positive
This dvd is a must for any cake decorator.  It is presented in short and easy to understand segments.  It works great for the beginner or as a quick refresher.  The instructor did an outstanding job of both explaining and demostrating?,positive
"I loved the book, very complete, detailed, clear instructions and easy to learn procedures. It is a comprehensive guide, useful for success in the art of pastry",positive
This has certainly improved my cake decorating knowledge as a pure novice. I will now purchase the other books so I can learn more.,positive
"Even this is the 2nd course, it is easy to follow. I love the results. I don't sell cakes but make them for friends and family. This is only a hobby so I don't make cakes everyday. I can pick this book up and follow the directions and get great results.",positive
"Finally, I am taking the third (and most fun!) Wilton class at my local Joan Fabric store and I am loving this book!  One look at the cover, and I was ""in.""  This book explains the gum paste and fondant techniques beautifully, with very well photographed examples.  I recommend this book most highly with its inspiring and easy-to-follow instructions.",positive
"This Wilton book is awesome.  My local craft shop did not offer the fondant course when I wanted to take it so I decided to teach myself.  I followed the lessons in the book and my fondant cakes have improved greatly.  In my area the Wilton Method instructors are not so great so I am happy I was able to save the money on the class but still get all of the wonderful Wilton advice.  I would definitely recommend not only buying this book, but seeing how much you can teach yourself before spending the money on the class.",positive
This is so remedial.  Buy a Wilton magazine for less money and get more ideas and instructions for your investment.,positive
"A good tool for home use.  Shows several types of simple, easy to perform techniques.  Would recommend for beginners and home bakers.",positive
Perfect! not bad of a book. I would recommend this item to anyone! Works great for baking! I would buy again.,positive
"I bought this book to help me out with decorating cakes and cupcakes as a beginner. I have found this book to be an excellent reference for the first time decorator. I ended up buying two different tips that did not come with my cake decorating set, that I have found very useful. I bought the cake curved spatulas, from Amazon,that work very well. I also bought the bench knife, and found a 16"" cake lifter, and a 18"" cake leveler. I got all these great ideas from this book. I bought other things in the book from Amazon, however, the list goes on too long to keep mentioning everything. Buy the book, great starter outer! Oh yes, I always take a look at all of the good and not so good reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.comSincerely,Super Chef David",positive
Wonderful to have a reference book handy with step-by-step instructions -- I used when I was covering my first cake in fondant and it was so easy!,positive
My youngest daughter requested this as a gift.  She was very happy with it and I may buy another one for my middle daughter.,positive
"I saw this book at Target and flipped through it.  I was amazed at all the ideas to do with a simple brownie!  Granted what I make won't ever look as good as the pictures in the book, but I'm okay with that.  If I had sat down and thought about it I might have come up with some of these same ideas, but some of them are really clever.  I have had fun looking through the book with my kids and we are making brownie pops for my son's b'day treats at school and his party.PROS:- You can buy most of these supplies (including the book) at Michael's Craft Supplies or Joann's and like I said, I saw the book at Target with some of the molds.- creative uses for brownies.  Great way to have an easy-to-make but fun treats for all sorts of occasions.- there are suggestions for b'day's, sports, holidays, gifts...CONS:- You need to buy the molds or supplies to make any of special shapes so it's an investment up front.  Once you have them it's all about Brownie Fun!I think this book is a great resource (or a fun gift!) for any parent or person who likes to bake and be creative.",positive
Cake decorating has always been a hoby for me.  This book is excellent for us self taught decorators.  The pictures and how-to steps are great,positive
"I ordered this lesson plan because I took the first two courses of Wilton's Cake Decorating, and I didn't want to sign up for the 3rd course only because I didn't want to spend so much money for the classes. So I bought the kit in Michaels figuring I would teach myself but this time the lesson plan wasn't included in kit like the first 2 kits were. This lesson plan is great and if you have some experience with working with fondant and gum paste this will be a piece of cake for you, no pun intended. But this definitely isn't for a beginner.",positive
It is a basic book for beginners and it is easy to understand.  It has a lot of ideas and I recommend it.,positive
The Book is very easy to read and follow it breaks down working with fondant and Gum Paste very Simple,positive
"I loved all the information I found in this book, very good ideas and pictures I recommend it to new beginners",positive
"Great set of lesson plans. I am thoroughly enjoying being able to learn at my own pace. Also, not ordering next book until I finish each book. Very motivating and thoroughly entertaining to all who are subjected to guessing what I actually made. LOL.",positive
I love Wilton books they are always so attractive and enjoyable to browse through. I do believe over the years they have reduced the contents so you don't get to see as many examples of lovely cakes as the first books I bought back in the 70's. Still I have learned so much about cake decorating from them.,positive
"It is very useful if you want to do flowers mostly.I was expecting more than just some pages, maybe I got it wrong but it is useful.",positive
I love love love this book!! Not only does it give you ideas on how to decorate and what colors go good together ...it also shows how to make the decorations.,positive
GREAT FOR BEGINING!! has all the things you need there are very few things i dont use from this kit !! would recommend!,positive
"I love everything of Wilton's. I bought this book to find out that I have the same one with just a different cover! But, it had a couple more ideas that I didn't have, great book, very simple to follow.",positive
This book is great for beginner fondant makers.  I was able to follow the instructions and tips and they helped a lot.,positive
Was exactly as stated. Very pleased with my purchase. Will order the rest of  the set. Great product. Very useful.,positive
"i learned how to make butter cream roses out of this book, very nice step by step instructions, easy to follow.",positive
This book is amazing! I love how Wilton publishes books for every stage of baking! This book is a must have for beginers!,positive
"I was a little disappointed in this book when I first got it. Since all you see on the cover is some ""clown"" cupcakes using the silly-feet baking cups (which I also purchased) I was expecting more uses of the silly-feet (I counted five), but it really covers whimsical cupcakes of all sorts, many of which would be suitable to make with children (easy to make).It's really just an idea book and a catalog of Wilton products and what you can do with them. There is a helpful section called ""The Perfect Cupcakes; How to bake, ice and decorate"", and there are about six pages of recipes. Most cupcake instructions are from 1/8 to 1/2 page long, right next to a big, clear picture.After getting over the ""it wasn't what I expected"" part of receiving this book, and seeing that my boyfriend seems rather enthusiastic about making really whimsical cupcakes and loves the silly-feet, I like this book more and more. Just don't expect anything sophisticated looking in it OR that many silly-feet ideas. If you are familiar with the typical adverbook that Wilton puts out, you shouldn't find any surprises here, and some of the recipes, which are a blend of from-a-mix and from-scratch, for the most part look very tempting.There are six pages of really cute Halloween cupcakes, including a vampire in a coffin, and some skeletons/ghosts/tombstones.",positive
I had gotten all the other Wilton books so I cld teach myself how to these decoration ideas and lets just say that these books helped me so much.,positive
"I bought this and the 2012 a the same time, only to realise half the book has the same info. It's more a catalog than a book of ideas. It does have some picture but it is basically the same as the 2012 year. It has a couple of recipes, but the are the same on both the yearbooks.I bought it because I wanted to learn how to make things with a step-by-step guide. It is not that.",positive
"I purchased the Wilton Course 1 guide a few weeks before I took my class, I found the book very easy to follow and easy to understand.  The only regret i had was my copy was different than the one handed out in class; the page numbers were different and it slowed me down a bit.",positive
"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series, but couldn't fit this one into my schedule, so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator, and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall, this is a great guide to decorating, but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything.",positive
I have never been a good cake decorator. It has always been just out of reach. This book made me say &#34;duh&#34; in my head so many times it's embarrassing. It really breaks it down and simplifies some of the basic techniques for noobies (like myself).,positive
Lots of interesting and helpful information for a beginner.  My daughter loves to bake and this will give her a opportunity to create much more.  Thank you!,positive
Easy to follow even for a clutz like me! Very informative and the instructions are straight forward. Im new to cake decorating so I have really enjoyed this book.,positive
I bought this because I haven't found time to take the class and found it's pretty easy to follow along and teach yourself everything in the book. There is step by step instructions for different designs and ideas and lots of hints and tricks for working with fondant and gumpaste.,positive
"Bought this book when I was hyped up and excited about baking and decorating cakes.  Although the designs are very outdated, it is very informative and I enjoy taking it out to view on occasion.",positive
I bought this for my daughter.  She likes to do cupcakes for parties.  She said it has good instructions and pictures and was helpful.,positive
"I absolutely love this book! Before purchasing, I found myself gathering bits and pieces of information from the wilton site to make the flowers and borders that I wanted, but this book puts them all together neatly without leaving anything out. I recently purchased Colette's Cakes which is also wonderful, but so much of it is advanced, and I'm just not there. I only decorate for fun. This book sticks to basics which, for me, is essential to focus. If I see to much detail I tend to become frustrated and over anxious. Then I end up giving up. So, with this book I can actually follow the process and learn step by step without the frustration.The only small disappointment was the weight of the cover. The paper is a bit thin and will need some support or will probably not hold up very well. Nothing a little clear contact paper can't cure though, so no big deal.",positive
"I've always loved cake decorating, ever since I took my first Wilton class.  Gum Paste and Fondant seemed beyond my capabilities but when I saw this book I decided to give it a try.  The book is very easy to follow with lots of step by step pictures.  It's a lot of fun but, I admit, a bit frustrating.  No matter how closely I follow the steps, my creations never turn out exactly like the pictures.  I think part of the problem is that I'm a perfectionist at heart but....grrrr.....I can't fault the book, as all Wilton Lesson Plans, it's great.",positive
THIS WAS EYE CATCHING AND WHEN I ORDERED IT I KNEW I HAD TO HAVE IT. IT IS QUITE HELPFUL,positive
"I learned a few tricks from this book. I am new to baking nice looking stuff. This helped me become a better decorator and got courses 2,3 and 4 as well. I wouldn't have picked anything else. Wilton hasn't disappointed me yet.",positive
"Took class years ago, using this as a refresher before starting a cake. Sometimes a video is faster than a book. Happy with Wilton items. Came fast .Stores don't carry video.",positive
Itr was fine  I was hoping for more  but it was as promisedI was purchased as a gift and they enjoy it,positive
This  book is good for some one that has taken the Wilton class it has some useful  Tips  not really what I wanted yet it's not bad it can be useful,positive
What a great book to help you get started on learning to decorate cakes. Very usful! Highly recommend buying this!,positive
If you've ever looked through a Wilton year book and said &#34;I want to make that cake&#34; then you need this pattern book too!  This book includes patterns for many of the cakes in the yearbook.,positive
I am trying my best to get into FONDANT and THIS book has motivated me to try harder and harder.  It has already paid for itself and has brought me back into the world of making family cakes as opposed to spending a TON at the Bakery!  THANK YOU for a wonderful book!,positive
"This short-but-sweet (ha) book gives all the basic information you need to get started with cake decorating.  It shows how to make a number of shapes with the icing, an icing recipe, and has lots of helpful illustrations.  Between this book and how-to videos found online, you could probably get enough information to be able to make pretty cakes without having to attend lessons.",positive
"Good guide for beginners.  Helpful resource.  Clear pictures and instructions.  If you can learn from just looking at a page on a book with a few written details, it will teach you without expensive classes.  But if you are using in addition to the class, all good too.  Keep it handy to look back at once in a while as a resource.",positive
I got this book for my daughter as the local craft store wouldn't let her take this class unless she took the other two first which she doesn't need. The book is full of color pictures so very well illustrated and the directions are clear and easy to follow. I also bought the class kit to go with it and it works great. would recommend for people wanting to learn how to do this on their own at home without a class.,positive
"I needed this for my third Wilton's class, and it was cheaper on Amazon.com than in the store. It's part of the curriculum, so it's required. Whether it is good for skill development or not, I take my classes very seriously, and get alot out of them. I also believe in checking prices everywhere for the class supplies. Amazon was cheapest, and I received it in 2 days, free shipping, Amazon prime.",positive
I really like all the helpful information in this book. It even has a recipe to make your own buttercream icing. I'm glad I purchased this item on amazon.com,positive
This is a small simple book but tons of basic information on baking. I really loved the graphs regarding the piping tips - I have so many of them but never knew what exactly do they do. So that was really nice to figure out everything on the chart with the pipe tip number!,positive
"This ""book"" is more like a brochure.. or one of those checkout cookbooks. It does have some basic tips in it but I surely wouldn't pay more than $5 for it!!",positive
"I'm not expert baker but, the video was very basic. I want to learn how to decorate a cakeand I think they focused to much on the basics then teaching how to actually decorate the cakeand maybe show more examples of her decorating. not bad, but if you are looking for something more advance onactually decorating a cake. this is not for you. but if you are new to baking, this is perfect for you!",positive
"This is an ok book for a new cake decorator. It recovers a lot of the stuff already covered in the instruction booklets (beginning cake decorating and flowers and borders) and gives some full cake ideas.I like the instructions and have been using them as a supplement to the instruction books to have ideas of decorations to practice. However, the cakes themselves are nothing super exciting.This is the sort of book you buy when you're starting out and use until you have the skills down pretty well - then you would probably never use it again. I just can't see myself pulling this book out for ""cake decorating ideas"" when there are so many better idea books out there.Honestly, if you weren't getting this on a 4-for-3 promotion or it was on sale for about 10 bucks I wouldn't bother with it.",positive
"I really like the Wilton Method courses. I do have some background in cake design, but this really helped me take it all to the next level. I still need lots of practice with flowers so this is perfect for me. I would have liked a few more tips and a bit more direction, but on the whole it was worth the money.",positive
"Note, this is a small booklet..not a book. It's maybe 6 inches tall by 4 inches wide and about 15 pages. The pages are in color.It's not bad but I would not pay more than $3 for it.",positive
"I use to cake decorate as a kid in 4H, this book was a great refresher. Helps me make gorgeous cupcakes for friends and family.",positive
THis book has been real helpful to my daughter.  She is just starting out and has made some really good flowers with this book.  A must if your into deco-ing.,positive
This product is of great quality. The product was very easy to use and it will have you making some beautiful decorations of flowers and other decorations. I highly recommend this seller for their speedy and excellent product.,positive
I purchased this book without taking the course. Cake decorating classes in my area are almost nonexistent so I have to be self taught. Lots of pictures and detailed instructions will guide you through the beginning of cake decorating.,positive
"I have almost every Wilton Yearbook since 1977. I still use them and review the back issues frequently for ideas. I do do not like the newer issues as much because I do not care for fondant, so I love the older books.",positive
"On the whole, I like this book very much. I have to say, however, that some of the instructions in it were contradicted by our instructor and she said she was instructed by Wilton to do so. I certainly felt that her way was better and, since it involves such basic instructions, I wanted to share it with you.For all the projects in this book other than covering the cake base and the cake itself--that is to say all the flowers, the bow, the leaves, and the borders along the bottom--wherever it says to use just gum paste, you should use a 1/2 gum paste and 1/2 fondant mix. Sure enough, it made it easier to do everything, there was less hardening and bumps, and everything looked prettier. (I had previously worked with gum paste on my own and wish I'd known this).Another thing that I noticed is that, in some cases, (especially the bow) the final product would have looked MUCH nicer if we'd made them thinner rather than as instructed in the booklet. It may be that, since this is an introductory course to forming decorations by sculpting rather than by piping, maybe they thought that thinner would have been harder to work with.But, all in all, it's a very nice reference (as well as an effective advertisement for countless Wilton products!)",positive
"great book, so many fun ideas..can't wait to get startedgreat product, fast shipping.I love the Wilton books and will keep buying them",positive
with four kids I'm really getting into doing their own cakes for their birthdays.... along with doing some side work... this book is awesome for ideas!!!,positive
"Easy to understand, great tips.  Learned alot and looking forward to creating the wonderful creations they show on the book.",positive
Nice quality bag! Vibrant colors. Worth it!,positive
I'm a Star Wars fan and I bought this with the intention of using it for groceries but it turned into my new diaper bag. It's huge! I can fit everything i need in it where before I had my diaper bag and another bag and my purse. It has started to come apart on the side but I can sew it or order a new one it's so cheap. I am sure the intended purpose isn't for it to be used as a diaper bag daily but it works and I have gotten compliments on it even! It goes great with my Star Wars Vans too :D,positive
It is perfect! I am using this bag as a gift bag for a guy's baby shower who is a die hard Star Wars fan! He will be able to use it after for carrying toys or whatever! Mini diaper bag even. Very pleased!,positive
I got this for my bf and he loves it. The stitches on the sides failed so I had to re-stitch it. That held well but then the plastic lining on the sides ripped. My bf used it daily for several months before I had to replace it. Overall a good product but wish it was better made.,positive
This makes a great reusuable gift bag for the Star Wars Fan. Well made and fun design for fans of the original movie.,positive
"These are really cute, for the pattern. I have bought a few of these to carry birthday presents for my kids friends. They are good for lightweight use, and the Star Wars design is adorable. But as far as grocery store use / everyday use, they are not that strong of bags. TRU sells them around $3-4 each and they are just about as good enough for carrying light stuff and toys, but no heavy use or day to day use here.",positive
Your typical reusable grocery store type bag. The art work is nice and the print is very clear. My son loves it.,positive
I love my spell check. It is easy to use & works very well. I like the auto turn off so you dont run your battery out. The only drawback is that the buttons are very small. I would love to have the same product with bigger buttons. I would defiantly recommend this product.,positive
a good multi-function product. it replaced a franklin spelling corrector i had  since 1989.i don't like the plastic case. it is very difficult to open. i broke a fingernail trying to open it.i purchased the new corrector because the characters were more readable than the older model's characters.,positive
"I did sloppy shopping. This machine is exactly what the name says it is - a speller. I wanted definitions, OH, that would be a dictionary! I ordered a dictionary an I am happy - except the voice is scratchy. Life is not perfect.gg",positive
"This was bought for my 3rd grader to use in class to check on some of the more tricky spellings--and it gets used a lot! It is not too big, not too small and the buttons are just right for small hands. It's quick to check things and it also stores all her friends' phone numbers, etc. The calculator is very useful too. Fun and easy to use, there are more and more of them appearing in the classroom now.",positive
It works fine. The cover fell off after a few months. But it still works fine and was a good buy.,positive
"The spell corrector does the job at a low cost, and does it far better than more expensive Franklin's.I don't see where age has anything to do with who uses this spell corrector.IT IS GOOD FOR ALL AGES!The only draw back is that you have to unscrew the back cover and pry itoff to replace the battery.",positive
This one seems to be made better than my Seiko spell check. I like the cover on it as well.  SW,positive
If you are a crossword addict you need this product.  The best on the market.Z,positive
"Marveling over this just arrived Spell Checker !! Three words already in less than twenty minutes !! Stylus or finger nails for this very light cell phone size cutie !! Quarter inch read out is way easy for the eye !! And to use too !! Starting, hopefully, into a happy future together !! Thank You !!!!",positive
"It works for my daughter, accurately finding words that she has no clue how to spell (e.g., ""becuz"" immediately found ""because"").  The one that arrived was black; she and I would have preferred the blue that was pictured.",positive
I love to do crossword puzzles and this is a fun product to help me find or figure out those impossible clues. Yeah I know you can cheat and check out online answers but I prefer to challenge my grey matter.  I had one of these for years before it finally died (even with replacing battery it stopped working properly/easily). Hope it lasts again!,positive
This was perfect for propping up textbooks so that I could take notes. This is a must-have for any student!,positive
This book stand is highly adjustable and functional. It works great for most moderately sized hardcovers and paperbacks. For overtly thick professional books you may have to consider The Easi-Reader Bookstand which is much studier.,positive
Holds my law books up perfectly! The stand Also allows you to turn the pages for easy reading and use.,positive
"This is a very versatile book stand that is easy to carry around and easy to store. It is ideal for smaller books and for those readers who don't need variety of reading angles. However, it can accommodate larger books as long as you are a bit careful how you use it. In addition to books, it works really well with a variety of electronic book readers and the new generation of tablet computers. I've used it with myKindle Wireless Reading Device (6"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)and iPad. In fact, when I was looking for an inexpensive way of propping up my iPad so that it doesn't lay flat on the table I settled for this option and so far it is working perfectly for me. In fact, I am writing this review on iPad that is propped up with it.The only problem that I have with it is the manufacturing quality. The first holder that I bought broke after a few months of use. I still went ahead and bought a new one because I feel that its many advantages far outweigh this shortcoming, and hopefully if I am a bit more careful with how I store it and handle it it may last longer this time around.",positive
"This thing rocks. It will hold your book where your want it to be. It will save your neck and keep you hands free to take notes or whatever as you read. It is super lightweight and convenient. I just keep it in my backpack at all times. It handles my 1000 page law books, so no worries in that department. The price is right. I see other people clunking around those huge, expensive wood book stands. This is way better. Go with this.",positive
"Want to pay upward of $50 for a thing to hold your Kindle while you read a recipe from it in the kitchen?I didn't either.So I bought this very simple, very inexpensive book holder.  And guess what?  Somehow it doesn't seem to recognize that the Kindle is NOT a book and can be easily tricked into holding a Kindle in much the same fashion as it would an actual book!!!!  Go figure.",positive
"I bought one for myself and everybody that sees it loves it.  I love it too.  It's very light and easy to carry around.  I like mine so much, I bought extra ones to give as Christmas present to my mom and other family members.",positive
"Holds even my Big study Bible well, and let me write my notes below it.  Great for Students.Looks too small to support a big book, but it does, and folds up light into my backpack",positive
"A good cookbook holder is a necessity for people who really cook as it keeps the book from falling off the counter, gives you more working space, and keeps drips and spills from soiling the pages.  I've used plate holders and even copy stands from the stationary store in the past, but this is the Real McCoy.  Very nice cookbook holder.  Good quality.  Even holds Joy of Cooking.  I'm glad I finally invested in one.",positive
Quite steady when used with a medium to large size book. For small softcover I would use something else though!,positive
"I use this for everything from propping up cookbooks in the kitchen to reading hardcovers at my desk while eating my lunch.  Most recently I've been using it for my Kindle 2.  Works great for everything, but a little tricky for some paperbacks because they slip around a little bit.  It does work best with the average-sized hardcover (think novel- sized).  Folds up nice and fits well in a drawer or in the front pocket of my backpack.  Definitely a handy thing to have around.",positive
Excellent product.  Efficient (including wide enough) for it's use.  Sturdy while not impeding the process of actually reading/viewing the book.,positive
"This is a really convenient book stand if you like to read outside of home and don't have larger books. If you don't necessarily need the portability or if you have large/tall textbooks I would suggest you look at something more study as this tends to tip over/make indentations on the bottom of pages for those books. Also you can increase the height of the stand by pulling  up part of the metal frame, but even with doing this it doesn't really support larger books well enough to easily highlight.",positive
"This mug is fantastic, it washes well, has a good weight, and can double as a nifty negotiation tool.  After all, who messes with a guy who has brass knuckles on his coffee mug?  Anyway, my husband has big hands and he says the knuckles are comfortable and easy to grip.  It arrived quickly and well packaged.  It's a winner, you won't be disappointed.",positive
"I've been eying this cup for awhile now and finally broke down and purchased it. I took a chance and ordered one of the 'used' models (it hadn't been opened but the box had a little damage.) The cup was in perfect, pristine condition and was only $6 shipped. My husband also likes it but his fingers are far too big to fit in the holes (I have pretty small hands and they are snug in it.)",positive
Great concept but finger holes seriosly too small.,positive
I bought this for my boyfriend and he just loved it!It was really good quality for the money.Very cool mug.,positive
Almost works like it is supposed to. The finger holes are a little small and hard to release the cup if you use all 4 holes. Just use the top two  and the large hole with three fingers and it works great. Good Quality. I would Recommend this item. Great Price and fast shipping.,positive
"I purchased this for my son's first birthday and the theme is mickey and it will make great fun mickey shaped cookies and fruit shaped Mickey's. Was a little smaller then expected but over all good product, durable and very cute.",positive
"This cookie cutter is perfect for use with fondant and making impressions in buttercream icing to be traced over. At first it seemed off, meaning it was lopsided when placed on the table, but I was able to straighten that out. I received it super fast considering it came from across the country!  Overall, I'm pleased with the item and the seller.",positive
I like this.  It's a little small but  that's OK (keeps  one from overeating too many cookies.  Seems very solid and Ithink it will last. Came faster then  they said it would.,positive
so cute but super small. Just pay close attention to the measurment. Have not yet used it but the cookies are sure to be micro.,positive
"I really like these ice trays, because they for one have a cover and therefore prevents any freezer odors from getting in. Also, they stack nicely on top of one another. Another thing I like is the Purple color lids. I would definitely recommend these to my friends.",positive
"I was leery about spending tis much for the Tupperware brand name product, but I wanted to upgrade to covered ice cube trays for use in our RV and didn't feel comfortable with some of the negative reviews I read of lower cost brands (mainly the plastic cracking after a few months use).  Now that I've been using these for several weeks I'm thrilled at the fit, finish, and quality of the Tupperware product and feel the extra cost is worth it.  The best part is no more spilled water when loading the trays into the tiny freezer in our RV!  I've already gotten tossed out the original open plastic ice cube trays which were just aggravating.",positive
"I don't use many ice cubes, and they would evaporate form the tray before I used any. But every once in a while I do need some, and they would be gone.With the tops on these trays, the ice cubes last many times longer. Maybe two years or more.",positive
"When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray, I was delighted. The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator. The cube compartments are easy to fill with the hole in the lid and as you walk to the freezer the cover prevents spilling.The MOST CRITICAL aspect is taste and smell. Since there is a lid, the ice never has a smell or taste even if you have frozen fish in the freezer like I usually do. I have four of these ice cube trays because we live in Hawaii where it is always hot and we constantly need ice for our drinks.Since I first discovered these ice cube trays I have never used the kind with no lid. These are by far better and less messy.",positive
"Finally...ice cube trays with covers that really work! These are great...there's nothing like fresh, clean, great tasting ice! I...like many other reviewers do not use the pop top to fill these, I find it's easier to fill these the old fashioned way. They do work very well and a little water on the bottom pops them right out! A great product!",positive
These ice trays are awesome!  Highly recommend!!  Keeps ice contained and fresh!!!  Definitely worth purchasing even if they cost a little more than other brands.  I have used the same ones for over 10 years and they still aren't showing any signs of wear.  Good quality!,positive
"I purchased these to freeze baby puree and they work great. With the covers, the puree will not be contaminated by other odors in the freezer. The cubes come out easily too, just need a twist by holding both ends of the tray and they will loosen up.",positive
"I prefer these citrus peelers to using a knife to peel oranges and grapefruit. It's safer and easier to pack in a lunchbox. These disappear in my house the way socks do, so I'm glad to have a half dozen of them.",positive
Months later we are still using this inexpensive set of citrus peelers to help kids peel their oranges in our school lunchroom.  Good purchase!,positive
These are great - like we used to get at parties but different colors. These are handy items so I was glad to find them. They were a fun item for our Christmas stockings.,positive
I needed just one more of these but this set was too good to pass up. I like having more that one color too.,positive
"This allows me to score an orange before slicing off the rind to make perfect garnishes for mixed drinks. Damn, I never had such perfect Old Fashioned until now.Also will unzip the skin of an orange so you can eat it, not just add it's skin to adult beverages.",positive
"Sure does save on the fingernails when I peel my oranges with this handy little gadget and love not have to go to a party to get it, Thank you Amazon.",positive
"I always seem to lose my orange peeler.  Was good to buy more, but was very disappointed at the lack of color in what I purchased, several back and a couple of ble in the set of six.  Good product but when all colors are shown, that is what I thought I was buying",positive
"this item was ok just as I expected I wish you didnt have to comment here on every thing, one two three four five six seven",positive
"These do what I expect them to do, which is to provide an excellent seal and be durable. A little pricey but can't argue for the quality.",positive
"These Tupperware Smidgets hold approximately 1-ounce. They are useful for storing small objects such as buttons, beads, scrapbooking items, paperclips, and similar items. At Tupperware parties, the Hostess recommends running the lids under hot water to loosen them up so they fit easily. If you do this, then they work well for carrying aspirin or vitamins.",positive
"I had looked high and low for a 1 ounce souffle cup and lid set for our lunchboxes.  The only ones I could find were disposable, and I strive to make our lunches completely trash free.  (See some of my other reviews)The Smidgets are the perfect size for salad dressings, little candy treats or marshmallows, raisins, nuts...if it's little, it flies!  You'll love them.  I followed the tip from another Amazon reviewer and boiled them for 1 minute then re-sealed them while they are still hot to make the lids easier to take on and off.  Worked like a charm.",positive
"I take vitamins. Most containers aren't big enough to hold them. These are perfect.* They have plenty of room - I don't have to methodically arrange my vitamins to allow the lid to close. I estimate these will hold around 20 big vitamins. 9/9/11 Update: I just attached an image showing this with 16 vitamins. I think it would hold 20 if you work at it. With 16, I can just drop them in and pop the lid on.* They are compact enough to fit into a jeans pocket.Yep, the lid is hard to get off the first couple of times. No worries after that. The bonus is that a snug lid means I don't worry about them opening and spilling my vitamins. Nice!My daughter loves these in her purse, too.The uses are practically endless (aspirin, gum, paper clips, skittles :)HIGHLY Recommended!",positive
My Kids love pickles. With this container they can get them any time and I don't have to worry about them dropping the glass jar. There isn't juice splattered. It's great to carry on picnics or to the lake.,positive
"very convenient, draining feature is great & goodcapacity. if only it wasn't colored so you could see the contents a little better & know what wasin there. i have a bunch of these in my fridge, & it's always trial and error findng the olives, pickles, sundried tomatoes  artichokes. i get there in the end, but if you could see the contents better, cooking would be faster!",positive
No more using silverware and/or fingers to get pickles out of the jar!  This 8 cup container by Tupperware is very durable!  It'll hold an entire 64oz jar of pickles!  I absolutely love this container!,positive
I remember my mom having one of these when I was a child - over 35+ years ago! I knew what I wanted and was THRILLED to have found the EXACT product I desired at a price that was reasonable. The color isn't important but function is. It holds jalepeno peppers and make it easy to access them - 'cause the jars are not user friendly!,positive
Works great for storing anything you need to keep submerged in liquid in the fridge.  I typically use mine to store celery in water.,positive
"Here in Penna. we make pickled eggs, also known here as red beet eggs.  I use this container for that.  The square shape makes it fit neatly in the back corner of my fridge.  The lid fits well; the strainer is sturdy.  I've had mine for five to ten years, and it is still good as new.  I just bought one for my mother.  She had her red beets eggs in a jar, which cracked spilling red juice all over the bottom of her firidge.  I have used mine to store asparagus with the ends in water to keep it fresh.  I think this would also work to marinate a few pieces of chicken.  I also know someone who uses hers, without the strainer, to store brown sugar.  So, it is a multi-purpose container.",positive
"HAD ONE OF THESE FOR YEARS AND LOVED IT; LOST IT SOMEWHERE, AND DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH I MISSED USING IT;MAKES SERVING PICKLES SO MUCH EASIER AND NO MESS;PRODUCT IS VERY WELL MADE AND SO STURDY; SUCH A WELCOME ADDITION TO MY KITCHEN;",positive
This container is larger than the one that I had previously. It will hold a 1/2 gallon of home made pickles with the liquid easily. Keeps them fresh and makes it easy to get your pickles out instead of having to leave them in the jar they were canned in,positive
"Great set to start with or to fill in the gaps. No frill, and no damage after months of use. Very flat looking and simple.",positive
Not bad for the price. I like the three pronged forks; it's fun and different. These are good for the price.,positive
yes overpriced perhaps at amazon.  off course its cheap but they work.  i  spend less money on flatware and it gives me more money to buy food and cram in my mouth. i like it,positive
"These are good because they are inexpensive, but they are not the most aesthetically pleasing and are very light weight.",positive
"The small spoon is too small. The bigger spoon is too big. Neither of them are true &#34;teaspoon&#34; size spoons. The flatware is very thin so the knife really has no cutting power (even for a butter knife) behind it. HOWEVER, for the price I paid, I can't expect anything else. They are pretty stylish at a glance but if you're looking to do anything that requires a durable utensil, this isn't the one you want.",positive
"You most definitely get what you pay for, these are very cheap and have already started to show signs of rusting after just a couple of months.  Also look carefully at the fork and knife, they are shaped quite differently than a regular set.  The fork also bends pretty easily which is not good when trying to eat a steak.  The spoons are also very disproportionate if you look at the little spoon it is way smaller than it appears in the picture.  I hate to say it but I was not impressed with Ikea in this case. I had to buy a whole new set to replace this one.",positive
I was hoping these cups would a little taller but they are perfect for my son so we are still very happy with them. I am still on the hunt for taller cups in these colors since I purchased the bowls and plates that match. Those are also a bit smaller than expected and work great for my son but they also do well for the adults.,positive
"perfect for my three year old triplets.  we have the bowls, cups, and plates from ikea and love them all",positive
"These are perfect for my home daycare,  perfect size for little hands,  compact to store,  and do great in the dishwasher multiple times a day!!  Get em!!",positive
"I really love these. They are a great quality, perfect size, and the thicker weight of the plastic makes them feel just right when holding them. The lip/edge is curved enough so it doesn't feel sharp. They also have a pretty wide base, which I imagine helps them tip over less. My 2 year old does good with them, and I like to drink juice out of them as well.",positive
"I was hoping these would be more like the size of the &#34;rocks&#34; glasses (wider diameter), because I wanted them to be less likely to be accidentally tipped over.  These don't quite make the dimension, and are a bit smaller than I was hoping for.  However, I love the colors, and haven't had a problem with spilling yet.  This is the double set, so you get two of each color for a total of 12 cups.",positive
"Perfect for bathrooms.  They are unbreakable and lovely.  Perfect for children.  They are also colorful and small.  They are not very translucent, if that matters.",positive
I ordered these to go with the plates and am very pleased that they are exactly 8 oz as I monitor the amount of liquid I consume each day and I love the colors even if I am a senior citizen.,positive
"These are great to bring up to the pool since they are plastic. They are small, but perfect size for a glass of red wine or any drink.  They are definitely &#34;kid cups&#34; but suitable for adult drinks as well.  I'm a fan.",positive
"Little hands will love these.  (ages 2-8)  Bigger kids are okay, but they really work size wise for the young kids.",positive
these were just perfect for my kids.  they love them.  they are the perfect size for kids to they don't get to much of whatever they are drinking,positive
"Perfect for 2- and 3-year old hands.  They wash nicely in the dishwasher, and the colors are vibrant.  I like them very much.",positive
"They are cups.  There are 12 of them, they are nice and durable, I was able to write on them in permanent marker with no problem so the kids knew which cup was theirs.  They are not BIG cups, but that is actually perfect for my students.",positive
"With grandchildren, this is the perfect combination of colorful and functional.  These are the perfect size for juice, water for taking medicine with, or when you don't want them to have too much of a good thing.  I bought two sets and had my daughter take one home for their use at home.  Love them.",positive
"We bought these before and have lost them over the last year or so. I reordered because I trust these cups.Easy wash, comes out of the dishwasher without being tweaked by the heat. Good size for children's hands under age 8 and holds enough to satisfy a child's thirst. The ribbed bottom helps prevent slipping through little fingers too.Overall, really like this product!",positive
"with 6 grandchildren, these are perfect and easy to find in the grass:)  They are sturdy and just the right size for little hands.",positive
"We assigned each family member a color, and purchased 3 sets.  They are wonderful, and they don't tip over due to the proper design of the weight distribution of the liquid. However, they were smaller than I expected.  For any person over 6, you need to drink 2 cups of water to feel like you had one cup.",positive
"The metal is a little more thin than I imagined but it is cute. Easily bendable, it can become hard to close, but it can be bent back into position.",positive
"While this is a cute tin box (and I used it to hold mini-muffins at at baby shower), it isn't meant to be used.  Would look cute as a decoration in a baby's room or to hold all those crayon's for an older child.",positive
"I like it, but the material it was made can bend easily.  My son love it it match with his collection.",positive
"My son is a huge Curious George fan and one of his favorite stories is the one where Curious George Rides a Bike. So, it couldn't be a better lunch box for him. He loves it!",positive
Bought this because the ratings were high.  My grandson loves Curious George and he like to carry things like this around.  I think he will love and and put some of his animals and other things in it.,positive
I got this so I am able to carry snacks on the weekends. We are never home so when I saw this I had to get this. First our toddler loves curious George and second it was just darling. Item looked just like picture. Best part so easy to clean with just a wipe. It's perfect in size not too big or small. Perfect for on the go.,positive
Kids are really into Curious George so they love this tin box to keep all their &#34;stuff&#34; inside.  It works great.,positive
"The box is really pretty, with its vintage style and its embossed scenes. The problem is that the metal is extremely thin, so the box gets deformed incredibly easy, and the paint job scratches in seconds. So, it is wonderful to look at, but not at all resistant.",positive
"were expecting . 1st off let me say this , it's made in China . It's smaller than your average lunch box and has no lil' drink bottle inside  either . Also the latch is plastic and although it's holding i've got my doubts as to it's longevity for my grandson . The box itself is however tin and although i like that it's metal , it's unbelievable thing metal and poorly hinged with simple folded over tangs or flaps as i'd call em that link it to the other and that's for sure not all that secure . As for the pro's or positives to this lil' box , it's Curious George and all kids love or loved his cute lil' monkey shennanigans at some point and time . The artwork is pretty well done and seemingly durable thus far . The price of course was a plus and sadly i'm realizing that we've got what we've paid for ...",positive
"I already have one of these I had purchased a year ago on Amazon, and, I absolutely love it.  It does a great job chopping onions, pecans, tomatoes, cilantro, etc.  I ordered this one for my daughter, and, she loves it.  I use this mini a lot more than I use my food processor.  The size works great, especially when baking!  I highly recommend!",positive
Was a little skeptical of how this would hold up. Very impressed. It gets much more use than the larger cuisinart.,positive
"Besides myself being a Cuisinart snob, I will say that I wouldn't use any other product in my kitchen. This does a wonderful job on small jobs such as pestos, or making peanut butter.",positive
"I'd recommend to buy this one.  This one chops very good specially garlics, onions, etc.  It lasts long too.  Our previous last about 6-7 years.",positive
"I received my Mini-Prep about two weeks ago, and I have used it everyday 2 or 3 times a day to make homemade baby food for my daughter. It is GREAT! It is easy to clean and I love that you can switch the blade from sharp to grind mode! I do recommend looking over the user guide for which blade side and speed for optimal chopping/processing. I had been using my full size Cuisinart to make her baby food prior to getting this, which as any one with the full size Cuisinart knows is a pain to drag out and I couldn't make just small portions for her. So, the Mini-Prep was the perfect solution for me! I have processed just about anything and everything in this so far and it has worked beautifully! I highly recommend this for any small job in the kitchen. Another plus is you are able to buy extra bowls so if you want to use it for coffee or spice grinding you can have a bowl specifically for those uses so other foods do not absorb the flavors of coffee or spices.",positive
"As usual Amazon did it's thing and got this mini chopper out to us in a jiffy. Now, do it chop. Yep, it do a mighty fine job and with very little effort! Sliced 1"" thick and quartered a nice size purple union. Zap, zap, zap with the neat lever and wa-la, fine chopped union with no juice. Took three sweet pickles and zap, zap, zap again and got finely chopped pickles with no juice, ya-hooo. Hummmm, gotta get out tha Gum-mbo pot now. Get to tha store and get some assorted goodies. Hey, it's File Gumbo time and I'm gonna be ""King of tha Kitchen"" again. Now ladies, sorry! Your he-man is gonna lay claim to this here ""power tool"" ""toy"" for himself, lol........ Yes, and it's a dandy looking little thing too........ Long life, who knows, but today it's a gooood life! It do seem to be sturdy and solid enough for a long life. I figure it'll last.....",positive
"This is okay for chopping cilantro, but does not puree very well. I my mind it does not live up to the Cuisinart name. Much prefer my old Sunbeam Oskar.",positive
"Bought this for my Mother who had her version from about 8-9 years ago finally die out. It looks almost identical (other than some minor cosmetical changes over the years) to her previous version.Judging from her original version, if it lasts at last as that, she'll be thrilled. Great little food processor.",positive
"My original mini prep had a sharp blade, not a serrated blade.  I got years of use out of it, and I wouldn't have replaced it but my husband mistakenly through the lid out in the trash.  This one is only so so, and food gets caught in the teeth of the serrated blade",positive
This purchase was a replacement for the one the kids broke trying to operate it.  I liked it enough to purchase it twice.,positive
"I also own a large food processor (also a Cuisinart) that I use for substantial tasks like making bread dough, slicing vegetables, etc.  Because of this, I use this mini-prep processor as a backup when the parts of my larger food processor are in the dishwasher or when I only have a small task that does not justify taking out my large food processor.Overall I get a lot of use out of this and have found it to be very durable and consistent.  I've owned it for almost four years now and over that time have used it to do everything from make homemade nut butters to rough chop vegetables to make my own oat flour out of oatmeal.  It has performed very well at all of these tasks and years later, still has lots of power and cleans up beautifully.  It is fantastic and I could not say enough wonderful things about it.That said, I do have a couple of caveats.  The first is that I would never buy it as a primary food processor.  It is just too small for normal tasks.  Even when I am making something in a small quantity like a dip I typically find it is too much size-wise for this processor.  Using it in an application like this would take forever.  However, it's great for doing basic chopping tasks because it is so easy and light to pull out onto the counter and efficient.  I also love how the stainless steel look coordinates with my appliances and other gadgets.  Overall it is a great product and if it ever dies I am likely to replace it with another Cuisinart.",positive
"Bought this to replace an old Mini Cuisinart Processor that was worn out (it was about 12 years old).  Love the red color, matches my toaster and coffee pot.  Works great.  Use it for small jobs instead of dragging out the big food processor.",positive
I have to puree my veggies and fruits. This is so very easy to use and such a quick clean up that I can go from one item to the next with a quick rinse.,positive
"I am a fanatic about kitchen appliances, specifically Cuisinart. Even though I have two other Cuisinart food processors that work perfectly well, I thought this would be good for small jobs and I couldn't resist the look. Not only was I not disappointed, but this has become my most-used kitchen appliance. I can mince garlic, make guacomole, turn garbanzos into hummus, and perform a host of other useful tasks. It is perfect if you want to make something quick, and don't won't to drag out the heavier, full-sized food processors. There are some culinary batches that you would ordinarily need to process, but are too small for a full-sized processor - this item is your answer. I have found the pulse control to be superior to the larger processors even - you can custom-chop tomatoes and walnuts (a quite difficult task) to your liking. The reason that I would recommend this specific model over other Cuisinart mini-preps is that this one is truly a miniature version of the full-sized processors - same Cuisinart quality, same original design that has worked for years. I have repeatedly washed the removable parts in the dishwasher with no problems - much easier to clean than any other processor I have used.The only mild complaint I have is that the blade does not seal as well as the larger Cuisinarts - it does make a perfect, restaraunt-quality smoothie, but I would use less than the amount suggested by the recipe book if you don't want a liquidy mess on your hands. But, it's better to do smoothies in a blender anyways.",positive
"Got this over a year ago for my mom in law and it's still doing its job! :) Fantastic.Good for salsas, sauce and more.",positive
"I've had this machine for about 10 years now after my husband INSISTED that I stop chopping onions by hand during the construction of Thanksgiving dinner.  He brought this home and well, I've been loving it ever since.  I do mostly use it for onions, but it is wonderful for spices and nuts too.  I just can't believe how powerful the motor is in this guy - it seems as if it could grind beef!  Mine has turned yellow (it was white) with use but I think I'm going to rebuy it in stainless steel.  Anyway, the price here on Amazon is quite good since my husband paid $34 for it 10 years ago!  I think I'm going to ahve to buy a larger one because this one is getting too small for our family. I don't like the way it cleans up, however, it can be a little much when you do onions. You HAVE to put it in the dishwasher for sure if you do onions because the plastic definitely holds the odor. Wish it was glass! Great machine for the money and I highly recommend it.",positive
"Bought it for our second home where I try to keep stuff down to a minimum, but still needed something to make pestos. This works for that. Tried to chop dates to make energy ball type things and got nowhere. Good little machine for what it is, but it's not a food processor.",positive
"received in good conditon, had to return the first one,  did not chop,  got the second one, it was for my daughter she said it did not work well",positive
"good little chopper, great for small jobs. very easy operation. chops evenly and clean up is a breeze. cute and compact.",positive
"I've been using this almost daily for about a month. Easy to use, easy to clean, and looks nice on the counter. No real complaints, except that the bowl feels kind of thin, like it would crack easily. I own a full-size Cuisinart food processor and another mini (a cheap-o brand) and the bowls on those feel much sturdier. I hope I'm wrong about the bowl, but I guess only time will tell. Other than that, no complaints, and I'd recommend buying this!Update 6/27/13: After three months of regular use the bowl is still holding up, and it's still doing what it's supposed to do. My only complaint at this point is that this little mini-prep does not have a feed tube. Obviously I knew this when I purchased it, but hindsight is 20/20.",positive
Not for me. It's so small (of course) and it's really only good for nuts. It pulverizes other products. I returned it with no problem.,positive
"ALTHOUGH ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT, I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE LARGER THAN IT IS.  I HAVE A $10.00 PRODUCT THAT WORKS BETTER THAN THIS ONE.  I EXPECTED MORE FROM THIS BRAND.",positive
"I came here looking for a replacement for the bowl which came with my mini prep becaue I dropped & chipped it, and now it leaks :  I did find this a useful little device *BUT in a very limited way*.  It does not have a very powerful motor.  You might well not expect that on such a small unti, but when I tried to use it to grate some roamno cheese, it smelled like burning rubber, much like when I use their blender for *anything*.  the things I bought from Cuisinart 10 years ago or more were very well made.  It has been a long long time since I have seen anything from them which is not made in china, and not to the standards the brand is known for.  I suspect that they either sold the name or are outsourcing everything.  Nothing is the same quality.  I am preferentially using 20+ year old plastic black & decker equipment from when I was in college :(I guess given the cost of replacement parts I will shop for another little chopper from another brand.  If you generally cook from scratch, these are useful (chopping onion, e.g.) and yes, it can handle bread crumbs... but not even a soft cheese!off to look at what Amazon has available from Kitchinaid, Hamilton Beach...brands which are still making products the way they used to ;)Updated 12/17/2011 to note that I purchased a floor model of the kitchenaid chef's chopperKitchenAid 3-Cup Chef's Chopper, Chromeat a local store (for about what a replacement basket would have cost.... they really get you on parts!).  They were being cleared out, as a new model was coming in, so, I got it for a song; and WOW! what I have been missing all these years :O It is so so much faster, more powerful.  I never would have thought there would be such a difference!  If you are considering one of these, I would urge you to have a look at Kitchenaid's little choppers.  At this point I have several pieces from each manufacturer, and am quite happy with my Cusinart full size food processorCuisinart DLC-10S Pro Classic 7-Cup Food Processorand stand mixerCuisinart SM-55BC 5-1/2-Quart 12-Speed Stand Mixer, Brushed Chromebut in the prep realm, kitchenaid has the better tool.",positive
"This mini-prep-processor is the second Cuisinart product I have bought from Amazon. The first was a refurbished convection toaster oven. The careful engineering and attractive, simple design of both products impress me. Also impressive is how wonderfully well they work!After reading a lot of the Amazon reviews-- not all 350+-- I was convinced this mini-chopper-processor would be a better replacement for the small, inexpensive Black and Decker that burned out with no warning after one year of very mild use. Avoid Black & Decker in the kitchen is my conclusion. Anyway...this Little Honey, that's what I call him, arrived the day before Thanksgiving. Before that I'd only used the B/D to pulverize cat food twice a day. The cats spit out meat or fish pieces they'd have to chew. Waste of money, so they get instant grind instead.What good timing! I put that Little Honey right to work. The slightly larger cup capacity, two speeds, a strong sounding motor of the Cuisinart, and its crisp good looks kept inviting me to whip up quick dips, sauces and icings for unexpected company-- as well as, the morning and evening cat food.The compact size lets me keep it up on the counter. I get more use out of it than my large food processor down in the cupboards somewhere. If it were a little larger I would replace the big processor.Why only 4 stars?I think it is a great little tool, but I am waiting to see how long before the motor burns out. And 4 stars because it does not chop evenly, when I chop such chunky things as celery or certain mixtures of wet cat food large pieces are left.(No, not together! I wash it out well between food types.)Usually I run it until I smell the motor burning then stop. That is after the recommended 10 to 12 seconds, alternating between Lo and Hi speeds. Some other reviewer mentioned the burning smell also, so I assume it is normal...Anyway, if it is still doing this before the warranty runs I will have to send the Little Honey back. For now, I love it very much.",positive
"I needed a way to liquify single servings of food to provide nutrition through my mother's feeding tube.  She does not tolerate the commercial nutrition, but does well with her customary food.  I tried using a blender, but the end result was inconsistent for bolusing through a feeding tube even after adding additional liquid.  We have used the Cuisinart I purchased when they were first introduced to the USA, which worked well but was inconvenient for on-the-spot use and for travel.  I read the reviews for this and other mini Cuisinarts and decided to try the ""cheaper"" one.  I am impressed with its performance, ease of use and compact size.  It is clearly worth the small price I paid.  I most like the ports in the top for slowly introducing liquids.  It is perfect for my intended use, and I can envision how to use it in cooking. I highly recommend it.",positive
"This little baby is a must for any kitchen, from making salad dressings and marinades to salsas.  Just big enough that I use it for most of my food processor chores; rarely do I need to take out the big processor.  Once you try it you'll be hooked!",positive
Quality food processor which is just the right size for the small batches needed by a couple. You don't need to process a large amount most of which would spoil before it was all used.,positive
"well i'm not impressed because all it is,is a mini food processor, nothing spectacular as they all work the same. I did like the fact that I could get it in a different color which was blue. I thought I would use it more but I have only used it a couple of times. I still like my bigger food processor and feel I may have wasted my money buying it. it probably would be great for an older person who doesn't need the big food processor and only needs to chop up small stuff.",positive
"Good quality and super chopper-I use pulse chop most of the time since it has a great motor response!! I think it is over-priced,however, I expect it will last close to forever!!",positive
Works great for small jobs including powdering some spices.  I also flip the blade over and shred onions with it.  If you fill it up too full it will not work well.  Remember this is not the full-size model.  It is also very easy to clean up.  no hard to clean nooks and crannies.,positive
"We received this for free when we purchased our Cusinart convention toaster oven.  We've used it to make small amounts of pesto or garlic sauce.  We've also used it to grind up fresh bread to make bread crumbs.  Given it's size, we had to feed it one slice at a time, but that was fine since the recipe did not require a lot.  So for small items, it's does a good job.We have noticed an electric burning smell if it's turned on for too long.  It's annoying, but not too bothersome.We have a 20 year old full size Cuisinart Food Processor that's still going strong.  Since Cuisinart is manufacturing their products in China these days, we've noticed that there is a big difference in the manufacturing and design quality of this little food processor compared to our old 20 year old full size model.  It does feel cheaper and that may explain the electric smell whent the food processor is used to much, the motor is being overtaxed.As long as you know it's limitations, it works well.",positive
"If you mainly use a food processor, or WANT to use a food processor for blending, chopping and pureeing foods, the Mini-Prep is such a good idea. It does about 80 percent of what a large food processor does, and it's easier to clean and takes up less space.If you find you typically chop herbs, make pesto and blended sauces, herb butters and the like and do NOT use the food processor for batters, doughs and slicing, you might consider the Mini-Prep. The motor is very strong, the blade very sharp. I made a fresh tomato coulis out of tomato, dried tomato, oil and herbs in seconds and it had the right texture (chopped but not liquified.)One thing I hate about large food processors is scraping small amounts of chopped herbs or nuts out of the large bowl. If your typical job, like mine, is chopping small items in smaller quantities, this is perfect. It takes up a lot less space on the counter, too.The unit comes in steel color and white. Before you buy a food processor, consider what you typically process. If you do coffee, smoothies, pesto, chopped herbs and nuts and salsa, this may just be enough, saving you dollars and space.",positive
"I was a bit leery about this model and hesitated given the price.  Although I trust the Cuisinart name, the fact that it was much less than similar mini-prep food processors left me hesitating (and honestly, screamed ""made in China by underpaid workers"").  I got over that (the first part; not super excited about the second) though, bought it, and LOVE IT.It handles everything I've given it easily and quickly.  Pesto, bread crumbs (including a batch of WAY overbaked croutons that were rock hard), spices, coffee beans, graham cracker crust (for a very tiny pie)... it's pleased me every time.My two favorite things: it comes with a little mini spatula, which allows you to get nearly every drop of whatever you're prepping out of the processor and into your recipe, which isn't always the case w/food processors - big or small.  Also, cleanup is a breeze- it rinses with a wipe (or top shelf dishwasher safe) and a quick wipe of the top of the base unit gets any ""dust"" from mixing right off- no crevices for stuff to get stuck (and get nasty).I love this little thing- so much that I bought one for my sister-in-law today!",positive
"This is a great size, easy to operate, beautiful look on the counter.  Can't say enough about this little machine!!",positive
"I have had the Cuisinart Mini-prep Pro for years, which I use all the time, but because I am something of a minimalist, it is too large for my tastes to keep out on the counter top.  I was looking for something to do the frequents small tasks of chopping nuts, onions, etc, that would be small enough to have a place out in public.  This is perfect.  It is about half the size of the Pro, and has a very elegant black chrome appearance and is about half the height of the Pro as well.It is lighter than the Pro in all aspects, but as with all my Cuisinart experiences, it does a great job on its intended tasks.  The warranty is the very odd number of 18 months, so you get the idea it's not supposed to be a workhorse.  But used as recommended, I'm sure mine will last ""forever"".  I've been looking for something like this for a long time, and considered Kitchenaid and other brands, as well as other Cuisinart models, and this one is exactly what I had hoped for.",positive
I had one of these which i burned the motor out on a few years ago.  Kept using the mini processor attachment on my blender ntil today.  Bought this same model in stainless at Big Lots for $29.  So glad to have this back in my kitchen once again. I may never have to pull out my large 11 cup Cuisinart (1992) ever again.,positive
I thought it would be great. I have Black & Decker that does a better job. It also has a small prep bowl. My big Cuisinart broke so I thought for a small size it would be good. Did not even crush wet beans or move it to the top as said. It was to late for me to return it.,positive
"This is my very first mini processor, i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose,small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However, i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it, used on HI as recommended, many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly, i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before, and the texture turn out perfect, just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy.",positive
"i bought this mainly to chop onions and such to save time of chopping by hand, but no matter what i do i end up with mush and chunks of onion.  i dont know what im doing wrong, if anyone has any suggestions - feel free to help me out",positive
"This is a good little machine with limitations.  it is very cheaply made.  no question about it.  I expect it will last a few months.  BUT, for the price I can either get it replaced or just keep buying new ones.  Not the best consumer mentality, but I think that's how it's going to be.  It IS very small.  I had anticipated making sauces with it but even for small meals you need to do it in several batches.  I tried shredding vegetables in it and it nipped away at the outer skin of it but left me with some round balls of vegetable matter that required quite a bit of shifting.  It's easy to clean and while it has quite a few drawbacks, I see this getting much more use than my larger machines because of it's overall ease.",positive
"I received this as a present and was convinced I wouldn't find a use for it.  Much to my surprise I love it!  It sets on the counter next to my DLC7-Pro.  It is a whiz for chopping a cup ful of nuts for a recipe, making quick bread crumbs for meatloaf, chopping herbs and making dressings.  The blade reverses for chopping or mixing so make sure to have the side up you want for the task at hand.  It is easy to use and a breeze to clean.  I just pop the soiled parts in the dishwasher and forget it.  I would not want to be a day with out this tiny wonder.",positive
This does a good job of pureeing things for my mother and it takes up relatively little counter space.  I can rinse the parts quickly and easily after I've prepared one food and move directly on to the next course.,positive
"This is a MINI processor, and that's why I bought it...NOT to do the big jobs, I have the ""big boy"" to do that.  I do like the how handy it is to do the small jobs, so I don't have to use the big one.  I use it a lot to make home made dressing.  Clean up is easy and quick, as is the machine.  It will scar the bowl if you try to grind hard spices, etc. however...but it states that in the manual.",positive
"I have had this cuisinart for about 2 years now, and it is still going strong.  I have been impressed by its ability to chew through large volumes of basil when making pesto, and small things like sesame seeds for making tahini.  It is also perfect for grinding cookies for pie crusts.  And the size means you don't have to be using a large volume to get great results.  I don't think this mini prep eliminates the usefulness of a full-size cuisinart, but it sure is much easier to clean up when you only need to process 1-2 cups of something.",positive
"Didn't know how easy to use this would turn out to be, but have used it constantly to chop up nuts that I then added to bread dough in my breadmaker (one cup of nuts at a time) for a high protein loaf of bread.  Recommended by my sister and now I can too.",positive
"I use this all the time to chop up nuts, grate hard cheeses, and make small batches of hot sauces. Works well when you don't want to pull the full sized food processor out and assemble it and then clean it afterward. It'll chop a good sized onion up to start a pasta sauce, or a couple of hot peppers for a finishing to a stir fry. Very handy and pretty well built even for couple time per week usage year after year.",positive
"I replaced my original mini-prep with this item after the plastic housing on the steel knife split.  The first one lasted about ten years, and I used it quite often, tho it was not abused.  Love the handiness of this item, it stores easily with a small footprint, parts go in the dishwasher for quick cleanup, just the right size for smaller jobs.",positive
"I love this little chopper. I lost my old one when I moved, and I tried a few different types, but I was never happy. I just had to get another mini-prep. It's easy to wash, very simple, and it does a very respectable job of chopping garlic and ginger and making small amounts of pesto, nut butter, or dressing. I use it pretty much every day and it never fails me.",positive
I had a smaller chopper of a different brand but wanted one that had a little larger bowl. This one is perfect. Thanks to my Daughter for recommending it.,positive
Great for chopping smaller amount of veggies and stuff. Does what the big ones do only with smaller amounts. Good for small familes.,positive
"This is a great little chopper.  I like that it does not have a long chute sticking up on the lid.  It pulses nicely and chops up garlic and onions quickly.  I also liked that it had 2 speeds and you could pulse.  I bought it for its small size to put in my camper, but liked it so much it has a place in the house.",positive
"Great little processor for the money.  I crush dry beans and dog kibble easily and fast.  Have no need to process large amounts at a time as it would not stay fresh.  This one works nicely, efficently and cleans up so easily.  I process daily soups for my dogs.  This is just the right size.  Easy to use, clean and is versitile for wet foods and dry foods.  I would purchase it again for gifts if need to",positive
We have purchased many food processors over the years. I saw this on a cooking show and immediately bought one. Best small processor ever!!  Others do not pick up all of the pieces off the bottom of the processor. This one picks up everything and creates a smooth blend of everything. Buy one for yourself and pass them out to the kids as Christmas presents!,positive
"The blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust.  I have very small fingers, and there is still barely enough room between the two blades for me to press on the plastic ring to remove it.  I can't imagine how someone with large fingers would manage.  My husband and I both sliced our fingers numerous times the first time we assembled this and tried to change the blade position, so I read the manual to see if we were doing it wrong.  Well, the diagram in the manual doesn't correspond to the actual machine, so it's useless.On top of the danger, it doesn't even do that good of a job chopping.  There's nothing I can do in this thing that I can't do better and more easily with my hand-held blender.  Save your money AND your fingers!  Steer clear of this thing!",positive
"I am a quadriplegic with very little hand dexterity and find cutting and chopping extremely difficult and time consuming. A good friend gave me one of these as a gift in the 1980s. That one lasted around 12 years(!!!) I just burned-out my second one: and now I'm here to buy my third! It's very easy to operate, even for a quad!!It really works fast and the processing mechanism is made well. I have processed things as soft as olives to as hard as almonds, and this machine tackles them all very nicely and clean-up in easy.",positive
"Then go with the Ninja Master Prep. I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush. When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant, so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush. On the New Ninja Master Prep. It has only pulse one speed, but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades, two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done. I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly. Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit.",positive
"I bought this unit to replace one I had purchased in 1995 or 1996.  I originally wanted to replace just the bowl as I had broken it, but with Amazon's price of $26.60 total I just had to go for an entire new unit. It was shipped free too.  I ordered the new Black Chrome finish and it really is lovely. My original one was white and this is a very surprising addition to the line for such an inexpensive price!!The only thing I can say from reading the other comments is people are expecting too much from this smallest of food processors.  It is made (and tells you so in the instructions) to be used continuously for no longer than one minute. If you pulse it properly and don't just leave it running, it is fine. This processor is the one I keep under the kitchen cabinet to be used to make small amounts of sauces,finely chop up garlic,chilies, etc. I have a much larger DLC-5 which I use for larger tasks.If someone is purchasing this for the first time I highly recommend sitting down and reading the instruction booklet before proceeding.  I haven't had any problems with the old one because I did that very thing when it first arrived. I even read the new booklet again, just to make sure if they made any changes.I was most happy to find all these years later, they still manufacture the original unit. I am not a touch pad fan and I am happy Cuisinart recognized many of us still like the original processors just as they were!! Adding the new finishes to the line as I said above just sweetened it up for me!!!It does have a powerful motor, but it is only a 21oz capacity, so that should make people aware not to over extend their expectations.  It is the perfect compliment to the larger processors and I would highly recommend it. For such an inexpensive price I think it is worth it!",positive
"A time for every seasoning......and a utensil for every purpose. The Cuisinart Mini Prep does not serve well as a primary processor for heavy jobs. That was not its intended design, or function.I obtained my first mini prep as a promotional gift with a DLC-7 purchase. For many years they have been contributing to my cooking enjoyment as a problem-free, complimentary team in a busy kitchen. When their lexan lids eventually chipped, (which admittedly is a major cause of aggravation with Cuisinart's products) I opted to replace them rather than spend up to 50% of their new cost for replacement bowls. I upgraded the old DLC-7 that is still mechanically perfect, with a MP-14 TM Limited Edition.The Mini Prep perfectly compliments larger processors. I specifically elected to stay with Cuisinart's older, boxier design; because its function is favored over the newer, sleeker model, the DLC-2ABC.The mini prep makes delectable, creamy homemade sauces and dressings. It performs equally well making pesto, cr&egrave;med butter, chopped fresh herbs, including garlic, chopped nuts, small portion purees, deviled eggs, spreads, and speedy fresh salsas. It has a fast and slow lever whose function I like because they may be ""pulsed"" on and off with an instantaneous response. This offers a demanding cook tremendous control over several types of prep functions conducive to small processors.Mini Prep seems perfectly designed to make one and a half cup portions of emulsified sauces and dressings, such as cilantro mayonnaise for grilled fish, or a dollop on fresh corn salad.Here is a basic example of how I use this workhorse.Herb mayonnaise:  place dry seasonings, a dab of honey, poupon mustard, flavored vinegars, or lemon/lime juice in the jar. Pulse to mix. Add about a tablespoon (who measures?) of Just Whites, dry pasteurized egg whites to the liquid (no cholesterol, calories, or salmonellae fears) ---pulse to mix---add a hand full of fresh herbs (cilantro, or dill, or tarragon is nice)----pulse to chop slightly. Then use the wonderfully designed lid that holds oil and has two holes on the top that will drizzle in the oil of your choice, without opening the lid, or fiddling with additional attachments that drizzle oil. You have the additional control to shift the motor speed instantaneously from high speed, to slower, or pulse mode, in direct accordance to your temperamental sauce's precise requirement as it thickens.Result: Restaurant quality chef's sauces come together effortlessly in minutes! Large processor's work bowls are too large for this type of job. One must repeatedly scrape the bowl's sides, and the motors are additionally too powerful to make small portions described above as successfully as the Mini Prep's performance.The Mini prep is very lightweight which makes it a delight to store in the pantry. It assembles and disassembles quickly and effortlessly. I especially love the function of the two (tiny) holes on the lid, along with the ease of the lid's removal for ingredient additions. The design and function permit those who love to cook an opportunity to enjoy their creativity in the kitchen without fighting with obstinate, dysfunctional appliances.It is a great convenience and a breeze to use. I love this little workhorse.",positive
I replaced my KitchenAid mini chopper with the Cuisinart because of the price and it was available in red. It's a nice little appliance and works well but it doesn't seem to be as sturdy as my former KitchenAid. My old chopper lasted for 12 years so hopefully this will give me at least a decade of service.,positive
"I have been using the Mini-Prep for a few years.  I like to use it for small jobs like chopping herbs, parmesan cheese, and for making pesto.  I haven't had any problems with processing parmesan cheese as one reviewer did.  The blade has two sides, a blunt side for processing hard items like parmesan cheese, chocolate, and coffee beans and a sharp side for processing soft items such as onions, garlic, meats, and mushrooms.  The sharp side is labeled sharp.  If you alternate between processing hard and soft items, you have to remember to check the position of the blade to make sure you are processing with the right side.  In addition, the processor has two speeds, HI & LO.  The LO speed is recommended for use with the sharp side of the blade and pulse action while the HI speed is recommended for use with the blunt side of the blade and continuous processing.  The Mini-Prep has a lot of kick to it for such a small appliance, and I have found it best to hold it steady with one hand, particularly when processing hard food items, because it will jump when powered on.One thing I noticed, in the instruction and recipe manual under Operating Techniques, the instructions indicate that hard cheese is processed with a blade and position speed of Blunt/HI but the instructions for grated parmesan cheese in the recipe section uses Sharp/HI.  I pulse at BLUNT/HI and then do continuous hold until its grated like I want it.  For best results, cut the cheese into small pieces as indicated in the instruction manual before processing.The Mini-Prep does a fairly decent job of chopping onions and garlic. On occasion I find a stray piece that the blades missed but that's probably because I don't always cut the pieces as recommended.  Overall, I think this is a great little processor and well worth the price.  Just remember to read the instruction manual before you start using it.",positive
"I wore out my original one, so this purchase was a no-brainer. I pulse/chop carrots for salads, and just this use is worth the price. If I don't have the mini food processor and I'm going to make a salad, I often skip carrots since I would have to drag out the big food processor, and wash all the parts afterwards. Carrots are so good for you, and I like small pieces of carrot in salads, not chunks like you get with a knife. I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces, dressing, and grating single servings of firm cheese. Very useful and versatile. This one is just like my old one, except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking.",positive
"I love this little guy!  I use it for just about everything!  I make salad dressing all the time, and yesterday I made topping for a cherry crumble.  Easy to use, easy to clean!  I never put any of the parts in the dishwasher, I think its ok to do so, but from past experience, these sort of items tend to wear out more quickly if they are subject to the heat of dishwasher drying, so I don't do it.  This is definitely one of the handiest little gadgets in my kitchen.  Great for gifts too!",positive
I bought this to grind mustard seeds when I found out I was obsessed with home made mustard. It works great even when run for long periods (some mustard seeds must be processed for 6-8 minutes to reach proper grind). It has plenty of power and has also now been put to use grinding romano cheese. It's just a lot easier to use when I don't need the capacity of my 14 cup processor.,positive
"I've had one of these little numbers for years and had to replace it recently when the piece of the cover that locks it in and allows the device to turn on sheared off. This happened after 4-5 years of regular use, though, it wasn't new by any stretch of the imagination. I read reviews about other models thinking it might be time for a change - I was annoyed that Cuisinart wouldn't just sell me a new cover; I had to buy the whole basket and cover apparatus for nearly as much as a new machine. In the end, though, I did just buy a new one. This baby chops, dices, and is great for making emulsions for mayonnaise or Caesar salad dressing.  The blade can be flipped over for different uses. If you read the directions that come with the product, they explain clearly how to use the appliance so that you don't get onion mush.  The only thing I don't do with it is grind spices - I have not had good luck with that and prefer to use an old coffee grinder. Otherwise, it does exactly what it says it does.",positive
Just cut your vegtables and don't waste your money on this because if you want to use it; you still have to cut your vegtables in small peices anyways. This thing will likely liquify them too....not a great product.,positive
I love this little appliance for chopping small amounts of food.  Does an excellent job.  It replaced one that I had used for 16 years.,positive
"This is a waste of money. I got one about 2 or 3 weeks ago and I'm sending it back. I have put no more than 1/2 cup at a time, of nuts, pieces of cut up carrots, etc. Every time I use it, this processor gives off a very strong, terrible smell of HOT PLASTIC!!! My opinion is, it's a piece of junk, and given how it smells when it's used, it won't last long!!! I would not recommend anyone buy this processor. It's not worth the effort to have to send it back!!! It's JUNK!!! DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!I received the new KitchenAid 3 cup mini yesterday, that I ordered to replace the Cuisinart... and WOW what a difference. I had read a review, that said the Cuisinart was as good as the KitchenAid mini... HAAAA!!! That had to have been a paid Cuisinart review, it sounded just like a paid ad for Cuisinart!Yes it cost more, for the KitchenAid, but man it is well worth it!!! The Cuisinart wouldn't even chop pieces of cut up veggies, using the pulse method as instructed, I stood there forever, pulsing over and over only to smell a horrible hot plastic stink, and chunks of veggie left in the processor, and if there was any moisture in the chopping bowl... it leaked out in drops thrown all around the processor on the counter. And yes the top was on correctly and the chopping blade was on properly. So when you read a review that sounds like a paid ad for the product... Be aware... it probably is.",positive
"Once I figured how to put it together, it worked just fine. My first project was to grind chicken to make burgers. I sliced the breasts into long pieces and laid them on the blades. No sooner had I turned it on low when the job was done! I went through 3 breasts in less than 3 minutes. This is really a time saver. Too bad some others did not have such good luck. I also love the deep red color. Great purchase.",positive
"This gadget works well, is easy to use, and is well-constructed.  My only complaint is that it chops too finely (even using the pulse method and the correct blade) for my usual needs.  If you want really finely chopped onions, carrots, cheese, etc., done fast and easily, this is your gadget.  But it's a little too fine for everyday cooking for me.",positive
"This blender arrived on Friday the 11th, and is being returned on Monday, the 14th.My first suspicion came as I unpacked the blender and I noticed the base was not chrome, but in fact, plastic.  (which was not disclosed on the technical information).  The cord was thin, and only had two prongs at the end, in comparison with my old Waring blender with a very thick black cord and  3 prongs at the end for heavy duty performance.My enthusiam dampened, I put an inch of freshly peeled and thinly sliced ginger in the blender, went first topuree, then to liquify, then with no decent results went through all of the  different selections and barely got useable results.  I then put in a half of bunch of parsely, (unchopped)  read the instruction booklet, tried the selections for different speeds, and end up with chopped parsley flakes everywhere.  Unwilling to give up in spite of failed attempts, I added my berries, and applesauce. Berries, sweet, soft berries, and soft applesauce. I pureed, I liquidfied, I went through all the speeds, and ended up with bits of berries, ginger, and tons of parsely flakes everywhere and produced the worst unblended drink in my blending career.  Perhaps most people don't blend fresh ginger and parsely (so-o good for you and tasty too), but my old waring blender has been making this drink for me for years, giving me smooth pureed results each time.Hindsight being better than foresight, I realized I allowed myself to be seduced with the very nice new shape of the blender jar, thinking it would work much better than the old shape, and the new ""touch pads"" .  Wrong on both counts.  The wide shortened new shape looks great, but somehow doesn't work as well as the narrow original shape of the blending jars.  The touch pads are a pain to use, and you have to be in the right light to see if you've turned the machine on or if it's off.  I was very disappointed in the blender, but more in Cusinart, a brand I have trusted for years who makes the best food processor imaginable.  So much for trusted brands. I'm refurbishing my Waring blender with new parts, at least I know it works well.",positive
"I may have lucked out with this item now that I've seen all the bad reviews with it.I've been using this blender almost everyday to make shakes/pina coladas for over five years, and it still works! I use only four of the 7-speeds since you only really need high-medium-low settings. The glass is of excellent quality and very thick; I've banged it accidentally several times and there's not a scratch on it. The top has a great grip when you close it. The base is made of plastic and feels a little cheap. I'm not sure what else to say about this item, it blends well and it's easy to clean up after, simple as that!I admit I am a Cuisinart brand whore. I can't help it, they make well-designed appliances, that work fantastic, that match beautifully with my decor--a trifecta of perfection! And not one of them has failed on me (yet, fingers crossed).Recommended from me, but please take the other reviews into consideration.",positive
"Cuisinart, I thought, built quality products. Then they started manufacturing this mess that they call a blender. What a stretch to call it a blender! It needs help to puree the ingredients for a smoothie (you must frequently STIR the ingredients yourself.) The blade assembly eventually cracked. There is now a black residue around the black whirly thing on the base. My husband thinks that it over heated. All that damage from making SMOOTHIES?! Yep. Cuisinart take note-I AM NOT BUYING CUISINART PRODUCTS AGAIN. I would venture to guess others feel the same. I'm happy that some folks had a good experience with this ""blender"" but I am not one of them.",positive
"I love my little blender!The color is the exact baby pink shown in pictures... Good, high quality... I mainly use mine to make my breakfast protein shakes in the morning and it blends up the fruit I put in like a champ.",positive
"In my humble opinion, most of blenders are not great.  The motors are not powerful to chop through heavy amounts ice and frozen fruit. I've burned through a couple of cheap Hamilton Beach ones.  So if you are doing a lot of entertaining, you might want to look at a commercial one.Use your head.  You may need to pulse it a few time to shave the frozen stuff down. Or you can slowly add ice after you blended the other igredients. Also, you should look at the recipe book.  The recipe book gives you hints on how to ""layer"" the ingredients.I made some awesome hummus by following their directions.As I said earlier, if you are doing heavy blending work with ice you may need a professional unit.  I have heard some of the high end Warings fit the bill.",positive
I use this for my diet shakes and it's the best. I also love that it is very easy to clean. And of coarse I love the color,positive
"First of all, my unit was factory refurbished, so had no warranty.  It smoked on the first use and died on the second.  I ordered an oster blender and it's been working fine ever since... two or three years, never a problem.But I won't stop there.  Thought maybe I could find the problem or use the motor for another project, since I couldn't return the unit, took it apart and was absolutely flabbergasted with what I found.  I'm an electrical engineer and have been involved with designing and building all sorts of things through my life... but this takes the cake for poor design and unsafe practices.  The motor is mounted using a paper (not plastic, not cardboard) tube that fits into a plastic ridge at the top.  It rests on the bottom of the housing on a rubber grommet and is not anchored in place except for this PAPER tube, shaped like a toilet paper center.  So I threw the bottom half away, put a mason jar lid on the bottom of the nice glass jar and thought I'd use it as an orange juice container... bad idea... it won't pour without slopping down the front and all over the table.This is junk and shame shame on you cuisinart... I'm sure they bought it from someone else because they would NEVER have designed something this badly... someone was making it as a joke!",positive
I chose this blender because I love the color pink. It is a fair price for a blender that works well.,positive
"I love the blender portion.  It works great at crushing ice and other items.  The food processor is another story.  Works to chop up and blend items, but the motor noise alone has forced me to stop using it.  With each use, the noise is louder and so irritating.  I am extremely disappointed that I can't use the processor portion of it.  As much as I love the blender, I can't recommend the purchase because you won't be able to use the processor without ear plugs.",positive
"I admit, I primarily got it because it was pink...however, the second reason I chose it, over the Kitchenaid Blender, was because it had a glass carafe that won't crack, discolor or dull. I suppose the glass carafe COULD crack, but I'd probably need to take a sledge hammer to it, LOL.It also crushes ice like nobody's business, which was the final deciding factor. A couple other reviews mentioned issues with the button labels peeling off (under warranty, I'd have gotten an immediate replacement - could have missed QC), dripping into the blade housing (no clue how that could happen unless the user held a glass directly over the blade seat) and the motor burning out after ""only"" 2 years (no mention whether the use was extremely heavy, or not). Those really didn't concern me since there were only a few of those. The more predominant reviews were fairly glowing, and those I paid attention to.Mine won't get daily ice crushing duties...only occasional...and I have no plans to try and crush seeds/nuts/cinnamon sticks (that's what my spice grinder and food processor are for), so that doesn't really concern me. The only thing that I would have wished for is a metal motor housing, instead of plastic. I'll just have to be a little extra careful with it. It's the sole reason I took off 1 star, but this is probably normal for modern, small appliances. Unfortunately, almost nothing is made to last, any longer. Planned obsolesence/replacement, so they can keep seling them, LOL.I'm more than pleased with my choice.",positive
"My Wife love this blender. Looks great, i has a large doubt whit this blender, but it's arrived at home, i'm feel good, because its really really very good looking over my counter.",positive
This is a great blender.  I had a Cuisinart Duet before - which still works but it's not nearly as pretty as this pink one.  It's reasonably quiet and does the job.  Cuisinart machines are generally a good investment.  I'll have to use it more to see if it's really a great product.,positive
"This blender replaced a Sunbeam I had for 30 years.  The jar is oversized and supported by small blades placed in a small opening at the base of vessel, isolated from the mass inside. It takes forever to blend anything smooth.  After operating the motor for more than a few moments it begins to emit a strong burning smell.  The plastic drive assembly for the blades snapped off in the first week of use.  Cuisinart replaced one free.  The second one cost about twenty dollars.  I would not recommend this blender, there are better choices.",positive
I own several blenders. I love this one. The size is perfect. The color pleasant. It is easy to operate. A must have for a small kitchen.,positive
This blender does a great job and is not to heavy or cumbersome. It's easy to use and take apart for cleaning. Would recommend this!,positive
A piece of trash for ice crushing.  Motor sounds like it's about to explode. The cup is just frustration if you're trying to make smoothies. Replaced it with the Oster Beehive classic. Way better and actually quieter because of the sturdy base.,positive
Not sure why all the bad reviews as we loved ours!  I am back to buy the 700 watt upgraded version of this blender.  It has lasted several years through almost daily smoothie making.  (Green smoothies are a family favorite!)I admit I never tried grinding up dry things or using it for many other purposes.  But for smoothies and mixed drinks it was perfect and durable!,positive
"This is a high quality blender that is made to last. I have had many blenders over the past decade and this is by far the best. Whether it is smoothies, pancake batter, shakes etc....it does a great job. Highly recommended.",positive
"Worked great for the three months that it functioned.  I liked the glass jar and it made great smoothies.  It was powerful and never bogged down.  Then it just quit working.  It is made in China and of apparently poor quality.  Too expensive to buy one every three months.  I would look for something with better reviews.I changed my review on this from one star to four stars because the manufacturer stands by there product.  They replaced the blender with no hassles.  However, it still broke after three months so you should be careful.",positive
SUCH A SWEET BLENDER AND STURDY TOO. I USE IT EVERY DAY. BOUGHT THIS ONE AFTER A PLASTIC CONTAINER ONE BUSTED IN MID STREAM AND BLEW OUT ALL OVER MY NEW KITCHEN AND NEW WINDOWS TOO.. OH WOW.. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PINK BLENDER. WORTH EVERY PENNY.,positive
"I was very hesitant to purchase this product this past christmas after reading the reviews here on Amazon.  My mother had wanted one for awhile, but always thought they were well over $100.  I found a refurbished one (which further made me worry, wondering why Amazon had so many refurbs if the product was reliable), and decided to give it a try.They have been nothing but happy with it since I gave it to them.  It has been used almost every day since Christmas 2003, and they have not had one problem.  Cleaning takes a little more time than a regular maker, but they say it is well worth it for how fresh the coffee tastes.Just remember...90% of people who post reviews are those who had problems.  Most people without problems never think to bother.Update - 12/9/08 - Apparently it finally died about 3 months ago, so it made it through 5 years of almost daily use.  My parents loved it so much they bought another one.  I'd still give it 5 stars.  The main reason I think these do break now and then is because you do have to take a couple minutes every time you use the grind feature and clean it out.  My parents did that, but I can certainly see a lot of people getting lazy and not cleaning it every time.",positive
"I've had two of these machines.  The first one lasted almost 2 years and made outstanding coffee.  The second one makes absolutely terrible coffee.  I have come to the conclusion that this second machine doesn't get the water hot enough so the coffee is weak and bitter no matter what I do.  The temp in the carafe at the conclusion of brewing is only 150 degrees.  I spent so much time and money thinking it was my error, but now I'm fairly sure it isn't my fault.If you get a good one it's great, but the one I have now makes undrinkable coffee.  I bought a refurbished one the second time around, I'll never make that mistake again.  There's a reason why those products are so much cheaper.",positive
"We have had this model for over a year and, while it does make good coffee, it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also, the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!",positive
"This coffee maker makes good coffee, but all the little parts, which don't fit together quite right will make you crazy.  This is a pain to clean.  The basket is large and over time became more difficult to remove.  After a few months, I couldn't get it out, even with a pliers.  Also after a couple of months the automatic drip control broke off, when trying to remove the basket.  I emailed the vendor several times more repair or a replacement part...no response.  Now that the machine hasn't been cleaned properly for a few months the coffee doesn't taste that good.  In the trash it goes.  The machine also ""beeps"" at you a lot....like I need one more complaint!  Good coffee, but needs design tweaks and customer service improvement.",positive
"My mother bought this for myself and my husband for xmess about 4 years ago.  We were in love!  The coffee is amazing, better than anything you can get at St@rb*cks and waking up to freshly ground, freshly brewed coffee is a fine motivator to get out of bed in the morning.I like that you can set the length the hot plate stays on all the way up to 4 hours as well the ability to adjust the temperature of the hotplate.  In the winter I like my coffee scalding but in warmer months I prefer it a bit less heated.Cleaning the machine - why is this an issue for people?  It literally takes seconds to rinse the parts off under the tap.  You don't want to use soap in a coffee maker ever.  We use a kitchen scrub brush to rinse all the grounds off under the tap and then DRY THOROUGHLY before putting it back together.  Not drying tends to cause the grounds to not transfer properly into the basket.Complaints:Honestly, 4 years wasn't enough time for me.  I feel it should have lasted longer and even then, for two of those years, we were limping along having to coax it into operation most mornings.  After a while some water or something got into the computer and we could no longer set the time or use any of the computerized controls, but still we pressed on.  Eventually even our tricks to bypass the quirks stopped working and we threw it out.  We plan to buy another very soon but are debating the thermal carafe version vs this one.This is a great machine, a bit over priced for the life span, but hopefully Cuisinart will pull their heads out of their nethers and make one that doesn't suck quite so much.  Regradless we're still going to buy another.  The quality of the coffee is unsurpassed by any other machine (save my pump espresso machine) and we love our coffee around here.",positive
"FIVE stars for excellent coffee and ease of use.  I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.  I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.  Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder, be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.  Paper filters change the taste of the coffee.June 2009 - This lasted two years and I would buy it again if this item had not been discontinued by the manufacturer.",positive
"I purchased this Cuisinart coffee maker with the idea that I could save time having a machine that could both grind and brew. I followed the directions enclosed with this machine and found that it produced a weak, pallid cup of coffee.  Ok, so no problem I just added more coffee beans and less water and so on and so on.  What I noticed when I faithfully cleaned the parts of the machine daily is that there was quite a bit of coffee left in the grinder and the screen and that a cup of coffee was now costing me 60% more because of this design/operational flaw. In other words I was having to use 60% more beans in order to produce a strong cup of coffee because much of the bean grind was wasted. So figure it out.  With coffee beans costing approx $10-$12 a pound [where I'm at] this coffee maker is nothing but a BIG OVERBLOWN WASTE OF MONEY! I would definitely not recommend this machine to anyone.  In fact I'm going to repack it and give it to my hateful brother for Christmas.",positive
"Okay product, made nicly and durable. You get a good cup of coffee. After buying this I went and got a kuring k-cup which is much nicer.",positive
"The design is such that you do not get maximum taste from the coffee beans.  Stay away from this model.  A chore to clean, plus mine broke about a year after I bought it.In a way, I am glad.  I got a Melitta coffeemaker to replace it  and the coffee tastes much better!",positive
"I think everyone agrees it makes the best coffee for a coffeemaker in its price range. It does take longer to clean. I purchased a second one (amazon sale for $59.99)since it was cheaper than buying the individual replacement parts. I use a soapy papertowel to wash the pieces and then throw it away. One should use soap vs. just rinsing to rid the plastic of the coffee oils. Then if I want a second pot, I either use the other set of parts or if both sets are wet, I dry the pieces with a couple of papertowels. This probably takes 2-4 minutes. I think it's worth the time.",positive
"The idea of a machine that ground &amp; brewed coffee was too good to resist, and for a while it was fine (althought it's noise scared the heck out of my dog);  within the first year the heating element croaked.  Sent it back &amp; got a replacement unit, which incidentally only is warranteed for the balance of the first unit's warranty!  6 months later, today, with a full pot of coffee on board, it burst into flame!  Whoa! Fortunately my husband was in the kitchen and took care of it before the house went up. I'm going back to Braun, no question!!",positive
"Worked great for the first year we had it, when we used it maybe 3-4 times.But after that, it seemed like nothing would ever really freeze up enough. I looked into the problem and decided that I might have damaged the cooling capability of the bowl by cleaning it with hot water (which is a no-no).So, I bought a replacement bowl, and once again, for the first year with a few uses it seemed to be OK.But now once again, it's just not getting cold enough - and this time I *know* it's not my fault since I have been very careful to only wash the bowl in cold water.",positive
"Assuming one has realistic expectations from such an inexpensive appliance, they will be very happy with this ice-cream maker.  Sure it isn't the fanciest, the bowls take up a lot of freezer space, and it certainly isn't quiet; but it makes a good amount of delicious - consistently textured ice-cream, is gentle enough that you can use almost any ingredients you like, and is simple to clean (even by hand if, like me, you lack a dish-washer).  Assuming you have the freezer space to keep one of the bowls prep'd you can go from zero to enjoying excellent soft serve in about 30 minutes. Overall a great product.NOTE: For most of the recipes I've tried, this machine produces ice-cream of a consistency akin to soft serve.  Very tasty in any-case and things harden up nicely in the freezer if you have time to wait.  But those wanting to serve cones right from the machine may be forced to make very small batches to accommodate this models limited ability to quickly freeze.",positive
"I received this as a wedding gift and like it a lot. Although it is super easy to use, it is not really a practical gadget for regular use. The canister requires a chunk of freezer space and must be frozen a day in advance. The appliance itself has a small footprint and a nice cord keeper underneath. Would be a good purchase for those who like different ice cream flavors, dieters, or those with special diet requirements (like no sugar). I usually make mango ice cream in it. In addition to ice-cream, it is fun for parties to make slushy fruity drinks. In  that case you will want to get an extra canister.",positive
Just saw this at Costco in Chicago for about 1/2 this price. I think it was around $30. Def. worth a trip to Costco if you have a membership.,positive
"My first three batches of ice cream from this machine got rave reviews from guests and family: a rich, creamy dark chocolate try out turned into ice cream truffles which the dinner guests snarfed; a nutty coconut put Baskin-Robbins chemically, oversweet version to shame - the guests inhaled it; and a Valrhona chocolate ice cream has made grocery store ice cream unappealing to the family.  Simple recipes work fine.  Cold mixing turned out as good a product as heating then cooling.Pros: This Cuisinart ICE-20 is quiet enough to run in the kitchen/dining area while we are eating.  It is easy to set up, use and clean.  It turns out a nice product - good enough to serve guests.  We like being able to have ice cream with less sugar and no chemicals.  It is entertaining to watch the process through the clear top opening.Cons: The plastic scraper/turner doesn't fit the bowl closely enough which leaves a thin layer of frozen ice cream to be scraped off.  Making less than ~3 cups of ice cream results in reduced aeration because the ice cream mix comes below the level of the plastic cross piece that mixes it.The best deal that I found now was at Williams Sonoma where the unit with a second bowl is $59.95.  The second best deal is Linens & Things where a 20% off coupon will bring the cost from $49.99 to $40 but they don't offer additional bowls.  The bowls cost about $30.",positive
"I really wanted to love this ice cream maker.  I was Somersizing and wanted to use the all natural ice cream mixes that went along with the diet.  I could get my ice cream to freeze- that wasn't a problem. It was like wonderful soft serve in the middle of the bowl.  However, all along the edges of the bowl it was frozen rock solid and NOTHING was going to remove the ice cream from around it.  The ring of rock hard ice cream wasn't just a small skim, it was a substantial amount.  Sadly, this has spent more time hidden in the depths of my cabinets than being used.",positive
"Works very well--but [at the price]? Come on! This unit isvirtually identical to the Deni ice cream maker I bought at Target for[little over half the price]this  spring--which also works very well. Shop around, people!",positive
"My mom gave me this ice cream maker as a Christmas present a few years ago. My husband and I are vegan, so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes. (I eventually started compiling them in my blog, A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise.)We've never had a problem with the machine. Every recipe I've invented has frozen nicely. I keep the bowl in the freezer all of the time, so I can make ice cream whenever I feel like it.I do wish that the plastic covering/shield thing was dishwasher-safe, because it can be a pain to clean, especially when I'm using a high-fat coconut milk. Still, it's not too difficult, and the reward (awesome vegan ice cream) is worth it.",positive
"We actually found this product on clearance sale at JCPennys last winter.  It has been a wonderful kitchen gadget, as long as we keep a few things in mind...1) We store the bowl in the freezer rather than trying to freeze it only when we want ice cream.  This ensures that it is nice andfrozen.2) We haven't tried to make frozen yogurt in it - only ice cream - so I don't know how it works with the yogurt.3) Ice cream recipes that call for something other than cream don't freeze as well and don't last as long after they are made.  When we make ice cream with just milk or with evaporated milk, we have to let the machine run longer and then we have to eat the ice cream within a couple of days.  It will also have a more crystallized and less creamy texture.  Ice cream with a combination of heavy cream and milk is phenomenal, though!  It will still form some ice crystals after several days in the freezer, but it's not bad at all.4) If we chill a metal mixing bowl in the freezer for a few minutes and then mix up the ice cream in it before putting it in the ice cream maker, it starts off colder and freezes better.So far I have not figured out how to make a nice, creamy low-fat ice cream in this maker, which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five.  I still need to try the frozen yogurt.  But, for regular ice cream, this is phenomenal!  We love ""chunky"" ice cream, and love to experiment with all the different things we can add to the Ben & Jerry's French vanilla recipe.  With the price of good ice cream these days, this quickly paid for itself because it's much cheaper to make our own.  We love it!(Oh, and we bought the Ben & Jerry's ice cream cookbook to go with this - it has a lot of tips for successfully making ice cream.)",positive
"Once I got the hang of it (there is a bit of a learning curve, but it's not terribly steep), I loved the frozen treats that I could make - especially frozen yogurt.A few weeks ago, while it was mid way thru churning, the upper, cylindrical part of the dasher snapped away from the vertical, scraping arm.  Because the machine is out of warranty, I had to order the part's replacement at my own expense.  While it's not going to break the bank, Cuisinart informed me that it would take 8 weeks (!) to fill my order.I'd considered ordering the dasher that was introduced in the newer model, since it's supposed to be more efficient, but I wasn't sure that it would fit in the ICE-20.Bottom Line:  Great concept, lousy parts.",positive
"This product works great, if the unit kept in the freezer for long enough, the consistency of the ice cream gets very good. It's easy to clean as well. I bought an ice cream maker so I could use organic ingredients, and everything has turned out fantastic so far. I have no complaints.",positive
"After trying other ice cream makers with mixed results (due to design flaws or machine failure), I decided to try the Cuisinart machine and have been VERY happy with it.  We've been using this for almost two years with no problems and are pleased with the design.  The running noise sounds like a small motor, neiterh jarringly loud nor quiet as a whisper.Keep the bowl in the freezer if you want to be able to make ice cream or frozen yogurt on a whim.  Cleanup is very easy, and the ice cream is comparable to soft serve when you're first done making it or you can freeze it for an hour or two if you want it to be more solid.  It's great to make any flavor you want any time, and to be able to control the fat content and quality of the ingredients.The booklet included contains about 20 recipes plus variations, including a number of ice creams, frozen lemonade, frozen pudding, frozen yogurts, several fruit sorbets and a couple of frozen  potent potables. These basic recipes are good and will get you started, but there are also some very good books of recipes available, such as The Ultimate Ice Cream Book.A very good, dependable machine.  Highest recommendation.",positive
"I bought this ice cream maker last summer and ended up not using it much because of time constraints.  This summer however, has been a different story and I have loved making ice cream with it.This machine is so versatile and convenient, you will be using it to make ice cream all the time--for parties, for yourself, anytime.  The only effort required from you is making your base mix (custard, sorbet, whatever you want basically) then you put the liquid mix into the cold bowl and turn the machine on.  No additional effort is required--until you're ready to turn the machine off and eat 20 minutes later!  The machine has a convenient opening on its top so you can add mix ins as your ice cream starts to freeze, or so you can just watch your liquid mix turn from liquid to wonderful ice cream.The only warning I would issue with this machine is that the freezer bowl is pretty big, so if you have a small freezer or one packed with food it may be hard to make space for it.  The bowl MUST be frozen for 18-24 hours before use to get a good freeze for your ice cream, so being able to store this bowl in the freezer is critical to getting good results.",positive
"When i first got my ice cream maker, 3 days ago, I cleaned and put it in the freezer. As sugguested I waited two days before trying it out.I mixed the ingredients for the basic Vanilla (except a few changes: 1c Heavy CR, 1c Light CR, 1/2c soy Milk, 1/2c half & Half, 2tsp vanilla ex, whatever amount of sugar it asked for, and added some green tea powder), and placed it in the fridge for about an hr-hr & a half. After pouring the ingredients in the top I let it go for 25 min. (as suggested instead of 30)and whalaThe ice cream came out deliciously soft serve! I put it in the freezer after eating about a cup and this morning I took another sample. It was a hard icecream on the softer side of the spectrum. Still so good!I can't wait to try another flavor, frozen yogurt, and eventually premium(hard, I'm guessing). If your after a nice automatic ice cream machine, this (so far) has seemed like a great deal for the money (even though it's a little higher then I was hoping to spend).",positive
"This is THE BEST fool proof way of making ice cream.  No more messing with salt and ice cubes--this maker has a special bowl that you keep in the freezer that freezes the ingredients (mine is always frozen so whenever I want to make ice cream I can). This machine comes with a pretty thorough booklet with ice cream recipes in it but you can make ""frozen ANYTHING"" with this maker.  Did you know that you could make frozen pudding? The ice cream technique that Cuisinart has perfected of a constant scraping of the sides of the bowl assures that your ice cream is super smooth too. Make as little or as much as over a quart at a time.  Great machine!  I've had mine for about six years and use it about once a month and it is still as quiet as the day I bought it.",positive
"First let me start by saying I was a little skeptical of ice cream makers. The ones we had when we were kids required dry ice and lots of time, neither of which I have.  This is the best though.  The ice cream is so good and really easy.  I've only had this ice cream maker 4 days and I've already made vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream and peach frozen yogurt and each one is delicious.  It makes the perfect amount for a family, not too much so you're sick of it before it's gone or too little.  And it's so easy.  Basically you just pour the ingredients in while it's mixing and in 30 minutes you have ice cream.",positive
"I have had an old Donvier manual model for 30 years, so I'm used to using a chiller bowl.  However, there's no comparison between hand turning the paddle in the Donvier model and letting the Cuisinart do it's thing. I love the fact that the chiller turns and the paddle is stationary.I leave the chiller in the freezer for 1-2 days and make sure my ice cream bases are nice and cold as well.  My ice cream is ready in about 12-13 minutes.  So easy, creamy, fast and smooth. Love, love, love this Cuisinart.I debated on whether to get the 2 qt model or the 1 1/2. My old Donvier makes 2 qts. I opted for the 1 1/2 qt and find that's plenty of ice cream.  Thinking about buying a 2nd chiller for times when I do want to make more than 1 1/2 qts or when I want to make 2 different types of ice cream on the same day.So glad I bought this!Farewell Donvier!",positive
"As described, read all the reviews and decided to replace my leaking old Krupps with this one and do not regret the decision.  My DH loves coffee ice cream but it is hard to find where we live so I have to make it for him and this is the easy way to do it.  Next I will try the recipe for Nutella gelato or peach ice cream.  The grandkids love to help make and eat our creations.",positive
"I had never in my life had homemade ice cream until now, my husband and I bought this as a Christmas present to the both of us, we have everything else you can think of but never an ice cream maker, well we are so impressed with the ice cream we can't wait to try other types. It is without a doubt the best tasting ice cream I have ever had, and this machine makes it so easy to make, just pour in the ingredients and turn it on, set a timer and you can relax, when it is done transfer the ice cream to a freezer safe container and let it harden and you have the best tasting ice cream ever! Try it, you will love it!",positive
I bought this product on the recommendation of my son to make cranberry ice for Thanksgiving.  I did everything that I expected it to do.  Great machine.,positive
"I'm the author of Lick It! Creamy Dreamy Vegan Ice Creams Your Mouth Will Love and this is the ice cream maker that I use. It's easy to use, makes great ice cream, is fairly quiet. I've had it for about 5 years and have made a LOT of ice cream with it and it's still going strong.",positive
"COMPARISON:Cuisinart Automatic 1.5 qtthe Rival Gel Canister, and theRival Electric 4&6 qt iceI have had quite the experience with ice cream makers lately and am happy to pass on my own comparison.I actually bought the Rival Electric 6qt ice on a whim when I passed by it in the store. This is the same one as the 4qt. ice cream maker that uses rock salt and ice, just larger. (I know it's the same because the inlaws have the 4qt.  It was on sale at Wal-Mart and even cheaper than Amazon.I then exchanged the above ice cream maker, after issues I will get to, for the Rival Gel.You'll notice, however, I have the ""verified purchase stamp"" on my review of the Cuisinart 1.5 qt automatic ice cream maker. That's because I gave up with Rival after continued problems with my first two ice cream makers and ordered the Cuisinart from Amazon. It's a keeper. However, you may actually prefer one of the other ones I used more if your needs are different from my own so I'll break down my experiences and you can decide:But first...some TROUBLESHOOTING that may help you regardless of the ice cream maker you choose. Is your icecream more of a milkshake than ice cream? I have some chef tips:1.Never put in chunky ingredients from the beginning. They don't allow the butterfat to freeze correctly. They need to be added at the end (chocolate chips, fruit, etc.)Soy milk? No problem.2.Never use imitation vanilla extract. It contains propylene glycol which not only isn't as good as regular vanilla, it prevents milk and cream from freezing well. Use pure vanilla only.3.Your ingredients should be cold prior to adding them to the ice cream maker.4.If you have an electric ice cream maker it needs to be on and spinning prior to putting the ingredients in. If you add the ingredients first and then turn it on, the edges will freeze first to the bowl and your middle won't catch up. (Unfortunately you can't do this on the Rival 4 and 6 qt electric so it always wound up a little runny for me.)5.If you use an electric gel-bowl ice cream maker the bowl should be stored at the back of your freezer where it is coldest. If your freezer is full of other foods, it will actually be colder than if it is empty so an empty freezer may mean you need to freeze your gel-filled ice cream bowl longer.6.Cream has a higher butterfat content than milk so it begins to melt far faster and will take longer to freeze so you will see differences from soy milk, milk, non-fat milk etc.ICE CREAM CAPACITY:Rival Electric (RE) 4 or 6 qts, depending upon which model you choose.Rival Gel (RG) one quartCuisinart Automatic (CA) 1.5 qtsNOISE LEVEL:RE: loud; cannot hold a conversation in the same room it's inRG: loud; cannot hold a convesation in the same room it's inCA: surprisingly quiet...not silent but quite a purr compared to the other two.BUILD:RE: Cheaply made which wound up being our problem. The outside core is a very flimsy plastic. Thinner than my Tupperware. Not only did this not insulate the ice well which resulted in fast melting, it also wore down after a week of the motor popping out of the locked position and it's flexibility allowed pieces of ice to get lodged in the sides and make the motor stop. This is so common that it says in the owner's manual that when it does this you need to stop it and move the ice. This means you always need to be watching it during making. Happens on both size models which is why I had to exchange this originally for the gel model at Wal-mart. That flimsy plastic wore down after just one week from the motor popping off of the lock sockets.RG: Made better than the other model except the top leaves air in too close to ice cream which means it doesn't freeze as well and the fill hole is on an angle rather than top and is very small so ingredients spill easily.CA: I like the make, compact so no warm air is inside, sturdy, stores more easily with cord compartment, heavy-duty with no flimsiness or easily broken parts.CONCEPT:RE: Winds up costing more due to needing to buy rock salt and crushed ice each time. The manual states to use crushed ice only and this is because the top pops off easily and ice can get lodged between spinning bowl and the side. For some crazy reason, the paddle doesn't spin, the bowl does which means it makes the ice migrate and melt easily. Rock salt should not go down your sink so we would also walk it outside to the street. You don't want it in your yard either. Very messy with all the rock salt and ice being poured in while running in comparison to the other two models.RG: Freeze the gel bowl for about 24 hours and use no rock salt or ice.CA: Same as the RG.ISSUES:RE: Had lots of problems with having to fool with it during the process to make it work right, turns off automatically even if the icecream is runny when it senses the edges are done.RG: Motor overheats easily and when it does this it turns off automatically and won't allow you to start it again for another 20 minutes. An ice cream maker isn't needed to mix ingredients but to whip air into it so it doesn't freeze as an ice block but instead becomes fluffy. This means you ruin your mix and have to start over. They need a more powerful motor to avoid this rather than an auto shut off which ruins your batch.CA: Does not turn off automatically and has never overheated. If you need more freezing time, you can just keep on going.  I haven't yet had any problems with my Cuisinart but will report back if one comes up.TIME NEEDED TO WORK:RE: Usually 50 minRG:  Usually 35 to 38 minCA:  Usually 20 to 30 minThe time will vary per ingredients.  I based the above all on my plain vanilla recipe.All models come with a basic recipe book but they are so basic you'll probably want a good ice cream recipe book.  I love the Ben and Jerrys one because it's not just recipes, but goes into the science of making the perfect bowl too.  The Cuisinart has the nutritionals to every recipe, the Rival doesn't.  You probably don't want to see the calories of ice cream anyway. Especially chocolate!WARRANTY:RE 1 yearRG 1 yearCA  3 yearsICE CREAM CONSISTENCY:RE: I was very disappointed in the Rival Electric.  It runs until it senses the outside edges are done but this left my inside ice cream edges not whipped. It says to get it hard you should freeze it for 4 hours but the next day, since air wasn't whipped in, it left it a block of ice and I couldn't even scoop it. Because of this and then the plastic lock in wearing out is why I returned it for the Rival Gel.RG: I got a good batch but it was still softer than I wanted, however the next 2 times the motor got hot and, as per the owners manual, apparently this design flaw is common enough that it turns itself off when this happens and won't start again for another 20 min leaving me with 2 bad batches so I returned it.CA: If you like yours soft, 20 min seems to work well for that but I usually go all the way to 30 min to get the perfect consistency of whipped air into the icecream allowing it to be soft but still easily scooped days later.  Even on high butterfat ice cream recipes we had a perfect consistency so I fell in love with this one. That was the main thing for me, to get a good whipped up ice cream. Not an icy one even days later. This one is advertised as having a ""heavy duty motor"" which may mean the difference in it not overheating.CLEANING: Owners manual of all say to clean parts in warm soapy water, not the dishwasher.CONCLUSION: Although the Rival Electric holds more ice cream which is perfect if you are making it for a big crowd, I have had no negative results with the Cuisinart since I ordered it while the other makers were returned to the store...and I rarely return anything. However, it's also possible I just got unlucky so if you want a large capacity and have easier access than I do to crushed ice, it might be worth a try.For me, the Cusinart 1.5 qt is just the right size to keep the ice cream fresh for us before it's time to make another batch. For a large family, it may not work, but we nibble on it for a week then make another batch and that works great for us and since the consistency and motor where better than the Rival Gel for me this remains my pick.",positive

"I had used an old ice cream maker for years, but got tired of the ice and salt mess, so was using the maker less and less. Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe. After reading some of the reviews, I was worried that it wouldn't come out ok, especially since I was using a recipe that has been handed down for years in our family. Well, let me tell you -- we were all delighted. If you just make sure the bowl has been in the freezer for overnight and that your ingredients are cold, it did the job just perfectly. We chose to make it the day before we wanted to serve it to ensure the proper consistency, but you wouldn't have to necessarily if you don't mind more of a soft-serve consistency. Love the machine; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again!",positive
"This machine works.  The suffering from having to hear it, the dissatisfaction with the end result has put me off making my own ice cream.  I just don't see ice cream as a part of my family's diet to the extent that owning this machine is warranted.",positive
"We've had this Cuisinart ice cream maker for several months now and have made many different flavors of ice cream.  Without exception the product has been excellent.  I've read some earlier reviews where the reviewer had a problem with the ice cream being too soft.  We have neve experienced this problem.  When it is initially finished it is not as hard as when purchased in a store.  However, merely by placing in the freezer, where ice cream belongs in the first place, it hardens to regular consistency.  Perhaps the reason is that we use the Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream book (available from Amazon).I could not expect or experience a better product for making any kind of ice cream.",positive
"I have one of these and just love to make homemade ice cream in it rather than my ice and salt ice cream maker.  I do have to say you really need to plan ahead as the bowl requires a long time to freeze.  I should invest in a second bowl. That being said, I would buy this again.",positive
"It really is.  Firstly, I have to admit that I've never made ice cream in it.  I much prefer sorbets.  And oh, what wonderful one's you can make!  The machine is super easy to use, as long as you remember to store the freezer bowl in the freezer.  Just pour in some juice, sugar and a couple flavorings, let it spin for 20 minutes or so, and you will have the most wonderful summer treats.  My favorite?  Fresh grapefruit juice with sugar, fresh mint, and lime juice.  People love it.  You can also use it to make somewhat more &quot;adult&quot; fare.  Use a bit of sugar and a bit of alcohol, for instance, a bit of tequila with the grapefruit juice and voila - wonderful adult party fare.Clean up is easy, storage is easy.  The only down side to this machine is that once you start making your own stuff, it's neigh on to impossible to stop.  On the other hand, since you're making it yourself and can limit what ingredients you use, the end result can be enormously healthy.  And what better than sitting in the sun, enjoying a big bowl of wonderful sorbet, and knowing as empiric fact that what you're eating is also pretty darned good for you.I've given this ice cream maker to several people as gifts.  They've all loved it.",positive
"I've owned this ice-cream maker for a month and just love it! To avoid the problems other reviewers have experienced, just follow these tips (some posted by other reviewers too):1) Freeze the bowl with a bag of ice cubes in it (thanks for the tip, Cynthia Nelson). It worked for me, and now I only need to freeze it overnight (instead of 48 hours each time I wanted to use it).2) Use a blender to mix all ingredients! It's easier to pour from the blender jar into the ice-cream machine, and the sugar is properly mixed and melted into the heavy cream.3) For fruit-flavored ice cream, use frozen fruits instead of fresh fruit puree, or you can buy fresh fruits and cut them up and freeze them. Blend away as you would if you were making a smoothie. I did this and compared it to using fresh fruit puree and found that the ""smoothie"" mixture chills and thickens faster in the machine (10 - 15 mins); whilst the fresh fruit puree mixture tends to take about 30 mins or longer and yields more crystals when the mixture is frozen.4) Put a small bag of ice on top of the opening of the transparent lid - use the bag of ice cubes that you put into the bowl in the freezer. It helps with chilling the mixture faster while it is being churned. Mine did not melt nor drip into the mixture.5) Put an empty glass container in the freezer before you start making the ice-cream mixture. Use it to store the ice-cream. I use a Pyrex bowl with its lid as glass chills faster than plastic.I modified a recipe I found online, and get awesome creamy ice cream which doesn't get frozen hard like a rock even when it's been in the freezer for 2 - 3 days! You can, of course cut down on the sugar or use fat-free products or artificial sweeteners (which I haven't tried - I believe natural is better than those chemicals in artificial sweeteners. Our bodies can work off the sugar, but the chemicals stay in our system!)1.5 cups heavy whipping cream1 cup Half & Half or evaporated milk1 - 1.5 cups frozen strawberries or any other frozen fruit1 + 1/4 cup granulated white sugar2 tablespoons lemon juice (optional)Put everything in the blender and blend until the ingredients are well-mixed. Turn on the ice-cream machine and pour the mixture in. Once the mixture thickens and has a soft-serve or thicker consistency, turn off the machine. Scoop and serve, or pour and scrape the mixture out with a rubber/silicon spatula into your chilled glass container and freeze for about an hour or so.",positive
"I love this ice cream maker.  It is easy to use, very fast and cleans like a dream.  I also like the fact it does not make a huge amount I have to store somewhere.  This is a great product for small families.",positive
"I make Raw Cream Ice Cream twice a week.  It works great.  It makes 6 cups.  I need 2 for parties.  Don't over fill and run till it's hard and it's firmer than soft serve.I get 5 cups of cream per gallon of Raw Milk, straight from the mamma cow.  I add 6 Raw Free-Range Egg Yokes, a 1/4 cup of Maple Syrup, 2 1/2 tablespoons of Vanilla Extract and 1 tablespoon of Psyllium Husks.  It's so healthy.  I consider it medicine for my 3 year boy.I find that it does stick to the bowl some.  It's not a problem unless you put it back in the freezer with ice cream in it.  I only do that when I'm leaving soon after making ice cream.  It's not totally quiet, but what do you expect from a motor.  It's quieter than the old salt and ice type.",positive
"I received this for my bridal shower.  I tried it to make sure it worked before I lost the gift receipt.  It is so easy to use.  I made up a batch of ingredients to make vanilla frozen yogurt.  It was quick and easy to assemble.  I poured the liquid in and off it went for 20-25 minutes.  It was louder then I anticipated, but nothing crazy.  It froze perfectly and tasted wonderful.  I am looking forward to making more delicious ice creams, sorbets, sherbets, frozen yogurts, and even frozen slushy drinks.  This thing is awesome.  It seems pretty darn solid and it easy to clean.",positive
"I bought this for me last summer, and I loved it so much, I bought another as a gift.  It's easy, taste so much better than anything you can buy, and it's fun to be creative.  We never have left over icecream sitting in the freezer now, and when we want some, I keep cream handy in the fridge, so we just toss the ingredients into a blender, pour it into the already frozen bowl, and ""Voila"" 30 minutes later we have icecream !!!  Fastest dessert I've ever made, and always a big hit.  Great way to use up ripe bananas, and make banana split ice cream.",positive
"I've made 3 batches with my machine; here are my observations.  The first batch came out a bit icy, although okay; I decided that freezing the bowl for 2-3 hours isn't enough, and, perhaps the room was too warm.  ... Next batch, I let the bowl freeze for a full 24 hours in the back of my freezer, and also, when running the machine, I covered the open &quot;hole&quot; in the cover of the machine with a piece of aluminum foil to keep the cold in.  That second batch came out very, very good; in the freezer, it ended up freezing quite hard but smooth &amp; consistent.  So, I tried to find a way to keep it softer.  For my third batch, I had the brilliant idea of first whipping the cream a bit, for a minute or two, before I used it (something not in any instructions) and that REALLY made GREAT ice cream!!!  (I used a portable Salton-type hand mixer, which whipped the cream a little bit, adding some air, but didn't really make it &quot;whipped cream&quot;.)In all other regards, it's important to read and follow all instructions.  Then, with the above suggestion to whip the heavy cream slightly before you combine everything, you'll get ice cream that is simply superb, the perfect texture that exactly matches what you'll get in stores, even though you don't add any stiffeners or carageenan etc.I have not tried other ice cream makers, but I have had such excellent results with this one, that if I were purchasing one, I would just get this and not take chances on lesser brands.",positive
"I own both the Cuisinart 1.5 quart ice cream maker and theKitchenAid KICA0WH Ice Cream Maker Attachment, both of which make excellent ice cream, although this Cuisinart, as a special purpose appliance, will appeal to a broader range of people simply because the unit is self-contained.The Cuisinart works without salt or mess; the bowl walls contain a liquid that, when frozen, becomes extremely cold, enough to freeze a cream/custard base to soft serve consistency.  (More on that later.) For the machine to successfully work, the bowl must be placed in the freezer at least fifteen hours in advance, and the mix must be refrigerated for a minimum of 12 hours, preferably at least 24 hours.  Unless you store the bowl in your freezer and use a non-cooked mixture, you won't be able to make ice cream on the spur of the moment.The machine is fairly noisy, much like the earlier electric churners that used salt and ice.  But operation cannot be easier.  Simply insert the paddle, pour in the mix, attach the top, and start it up.  In 20-30 minutes, depending on the butterfat content and beginning temperature of the mix, you have soft serve consistency ice cream, sorbet, frozen yogurt, or sherbet.  To improve the flavor and consistency, the frozen dessert should be ripened in another container for at least 2 hours in the freezer.The biggest drawbacks to the Cuisinart ice cream maker are its relatively small size, especially compared to the KitchenAid attachment, and the way a portion of the ice cream freezes solid to the sides of the bowl, thus creating some waste.  Of course, you can always take a sturdy non-metal utensil to it to sample it right away.  You'll have to let the bowl thaw some before hand-washing.  None of the parts are dishwasher safe, although all are a breeze to clean once the bowl loses its extreme cold.If you own a KitchenAid mixer, you might want to check out the attachment, but you really can't go wrong with the Cuisinart.  Fresh ice cream has never been easier.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",positive
"I love my Cuisinart ICE-20 Ice cream maker and would highly recommend it to anyone. I have made countless different recipes in it, and this machine makes creamy ice cream in mere minutes. I have also partly frozen the ice cream and then layered a combination of flavors creating a stunning semifredo dessert. When you can get Cuisinart quality at such a reasonable price, why pay more? The only problem I had was that the ice cream was so good I wanted to make more shortly after and the freezer bowl had not completely frozen again. An additional freezer bowl is on my Christmas wish list this year!",positive
"I bought this because I love ice cream and can't have many of the ""preservatives"" in store brands and I can't afford the price of high end natural ice creams. Thinking worse case scenario the grandkids would love it I made my first batch of ice cream using fat free half and half, it was amazing!As for the noise it makes, I discovered that setting it on a folded towel on the counter cuts down on the noise alot. My husbands plan is setting it up in the laundry room, closing the door and setting a time, lol that works too.I usually only have to place container in the frezer for 6 hours before using it so I think freezing time depends on type of freezer and settings.What I like teh most is how easy it is to make ice cream and the clean up is also fast and easy.I'm getting each of my adult children one for Christmas gifts this year.",positive
"I really found this product to be wonderful, compared to others which I have used. It really lives up to it's claims.",positive
Most ice cream beside Bryers contains High fructose corn syrup a genetically altered product the goes the serial sets with acids enzymes and bacteria to create this very unnatural product and while its in alot of adult food suprising it never in baby food maybe that can be expalned as baby rats die in 5 weeks when feed it while normal rats lives an avarage of 2 years unlees there feed a high copper dietso making you own ice cream is much better for you the genetically altered [...]and all those who had one die with in a month or two get over it as you got a defective one so return it. my recomendations is to use it a lot in the first month even if you got to give it to friends to make sure you got a good one. so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced,positive
I really like this and I ordered it for my son and wife as I love mine.  No mess and you have great home made ice cream in about 30 minutes.,positive
"I usually just make ice cream, yogurt, or sorbet during the summer months only, but still I am so happy that this is still going strong; thisCuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker, Whitehas outlasted my expectations as well as exceeded my expectations.  I purchased ICE-20FR on February 6, 2002 from Amazon for $29.99 re-conditioned and I am so happy I discovered it on Amazon and tried it!  I recommend buying a second bowlCuisinart 1-1/2-Quart Additional Freezer Bowl, fits ICE-20 Ice Cream Makerto freeze so that way you can always be ready to make another flavor; when I purchased mine they were $29.99 as well!  Also presentation is fun so check outAnchor Hocking Tulip Sundae Fountainware, Clear, Set of 12.  When/if my ever breaks, I would buy another one on amazon PRONTO.  I don't remember ever having a single problem with it not freezing but I use very natural healthy products and it sounds like some other reviewers were unknowingly putting anti-freeze in theirs not being aware of it.  I most often don't follow a recipe but simply create my own.  My easiest creation is simply pouring in half a quart of Blueberry Pomegranate Cultured Goat Milk Kefir and that froze fine and was great!  I also often use coconut milk, some sweetener choice, and a flavor!  I add fresh fruits in the ice cream or afterwards as topping.  I don't think I ever threw out any of my creations and I am very picky and do throw out other non-frozen recipes.  I think my secret is to taste it before freezing it; if you don't like it the taste unfrozen, you won't like it frozen!",positive
"This works well, but there are a few points to make it a success.-First, make sure your freezer is cold. A lot of freezers are too warm. -10 to zero F is ideal. Recommended food storage is halved for every 5 degrees above zero F. At -10 you are golden for this unit.-Second, make sure you freeze the bowl for a long time. 24 hours should be enough.-Third, make sure your ingredients are cold. Even if they are cool, it should be ok, but will be softer.Custard based recipes work great. Regarding taste... I'm amazed how many people have become so accustomed to artificial flavors and conditioners, that ""real"" doesn't taste right anymore. I find pure cream based recipes can leave a bit of a film on the roof of the mouth regardless of the tool used, but cutting with 25% half-and-half or whole milk is a good ratio. Nothing beats a good custard based ice cream on a hot day, four or five ingredients: Cream, sugar, eggs, flavorings, home run.Some things I don't like about it:Gel based freezers work, but they warm up from the second you take them out of the freezer. The old style salt and ice can maintain temps well, and the expensive integrated freezer units are about perfect, but obviously cost more. You need know know that going in. Gel isn't magic, but it works. You can't fault it for being something it's not though.The dasher doesn't scrape the side of the bowl, it sits off just slightly. This leaves a ring of frozen icy cream, not a smooth ice cream stuck to the side. I think the newer version has a better dasher/scraper.I might try running it in the freezer on an extension cord... why not.No way I would pay full retail for this, but at the current price point, it's a good deal.Also consider buying a treadmill or running shoes.",positive
"The ice-cream maker seems to work perfectly fine. It is everything I expected.  The design is easy to manage.  I have to say though, I am still working on getting perfect, creamy ice-cream from it while using quality ingredients.  Sorbets turn out wonderful!  Overall, I am glad I have this gadget in my kitchen!  Playing with the idea of a perfect ice-cream is delicious in itself!",positive
"I made my first batch of ice cream today.I made the vanilla which was very easy;vanilla,milk,sugar and cream. I pushed the button and waited. I had to run and get my son from a playdate.When I got back it was done! I treated all the kids to a cone and they were full of compliments.They loved it!! It was sweet and perfectly creamy.I can't immagine what flavors will taste like.This is the best!",positive
"I loved using this product at first and it made quality ice cream that was great for at home or social events.  However, the paddle broke 2 months into it and I have been unable to use the ice cream maker since then. I wish the plastic paddle was a little more durable.",positive
"i gave this to my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it. once you put all the stuff in the bowl it only takes 15 minutes, though it should be noted that it then needs a few hours in the freezer to freeze up fully and that many recipes require a little prior prepping. i still think this is the easiest one you will find and it's a big plus to not need ice or salt. very easy to clean and there is an opening at the top so you can watch it work. very cool.",positive
":happy dance: I made real ice cream with this little machine.  I got it just recently and I've given it a go since making all the following flavors: maple nut, coffee, coffee walnut, strawberry with chocolate chunks, and mango ice cream"".  My bowel took 2 days to freeze the first time but I changed the setting on my freezer to the highest setting available and now my bowl freezes within 5 to 6 hours. Also this helps my ice cream not come out too runny. I transfer it to a container and put it in the freezer and it ""ripens"" and becomes harder consistency.  I don't have an separate recipe book. I just use the basic vanilla ice cream recipe and for the maple nut I added one cup of maple syrup but used less sugar. I added walnut bits at the end of the cycle. Oh there is no timer on this unit so you have to decide when the cycle of it churning should end. For my coffee ice cream I used theMedaglia D' Oro Instant Espresso Coffee, 2-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)instant espresso coffee (delicious)...I used 3 spoonfuls and it was perfect in flavor. Now my strawberry ice cream, I again followed the basic vanilla ice cream recipe in the booklet that comes with the ice cream machine and I added a cup of fresh strawberries and I bought a large bar of dark chocolate which I broke up into pieces and put that in. OMG this was my best yet!!! The mango ice cream I did for my daughter because she loves Mango ice cream, again following the basic recipe I reduced the amount of sugar I put in it and added a cup of Mango nectar. So far everything has come out delicious, I freeze it in a separate container for the ""real ice cream"" consistency. This machine works perfect for the price, the amount of work, etc., you cannot go wrong.",positive
"I was a little hesitant because some reviewers talked about the freezing tub being fragile or the sorbet being too soft or it being too slow.  I strongly disagree.  I have used this beauty for dessert 4 or 5 nights a week since getting it over a month ago.  I mix up the ingredients and put them in the refrigerator to thoroughly cool, then put the freezer together and pour it in.  10 to 20 minutes later, it's ready (depends on exact mix).  If you think it's too soft, you're not used to home-made ice cream!  The outside of the freezer tub is not metal, but I don't think it could be with the material inside it which has to expand.  Obviously you have to be aware of that.  The interior of the tub is stronger and I use my plastic ice cream scooper and hard plastic spatula to get every drop of the goodies every time.  This is a champ.  We've probably made enough homemade goodies already to pay for it if you think about how much we would have paid for that much ice cream or frozen dessert.",positive
"Awesome product... just make sure that your freezer bowl is frozen solid... leave it in your freezer for 1 1/2 to 2 days between ice cream batches just to be sure.  Also, you may want to chill your mixture for 1-2 hours in the refrigerator prior to using the ice cream machine.  My first batch was awful because my bowl was not completely frozen and my mixture wasn't as cold as it should have been.  Other than that, its an awesome machine that is easy to clean and makes wonderful ice cream.  If you really like ice cream or have a large family, you may want to buy an extra freezer bowl.  The ice cream will go fast!",positive
This works fineIt is handy when needing a small amount of ice creamIt beats turning the crank handle on the old wooden one we use in the old days,positive
"I've had this ice-cream maker for nearly two years now and love it.  My only complaint is I wish it were a 2-quart capacity; the ice cream is so good but goes so fast!  The recipes in the accompanying booklet produce just the right texture in the finished product, and after a few tries you can easily modify them to make any flavor you desire.It's ideal for whipping up a premium dessert in a short amount of time when you have last-minute guests; just keep plenty of whole milk and heavy cream in the back of the fridge at all times!  Everyone who has tried my mocha-toffee-hazelnut homemade ice cream from this machine has loved it, and quite a few have proclaimed it the best ice cream they have ever eaten.  And you just can't beat how quick and easy it is to make.One tip -- make sure you have a 2-quart plastic container on hand to store the ice cream; you cannot store it in the mixing bowl because it is easily damaged.  In general, right after you take the ice cream out of the mixer, it can be served right away if you have kept your ingredients very cold, but its texture will benefit from spending at least an hour in the coldest part of your freezer.Some people have complained about the noise; it's loud enough to bother a cat but not so loud you can't talk over it.  Definitely not a reason to avoid purchase.",positive
"What Donvier started, Cuisinart perfected! There are a lot of great features to this machine. I like the 1.5 quart capacity, because most recipes that say they're 1 quart are actually more when frozen, so I rarely have leftover mix.The opening in the top makes it easy to start the freezing process without having the dasher stick to the can. It's also great for last-minute additions, which I do a lot because I generally add a bit of vodka at the end to keep my ice cream from getting too hard.I purchased an extra bowl and it's come in handy many, many times. Sometimes you don't want 1.5 quarts of the same flavor, so I'll make the custard base and turn it into two different flavors of ice cream and I can freeze them one after the other. The extra bowl also helps if I'm in a hurry and don't want to totally chill the mix. Then I chill it almost to the freezing point in one and move it to the second one. Buy an extra bowl!!",positive
"This little machine works like a breeze.  Well made and easy clean up.  The biggest problem I have noticed is that relatively few people know how cold their freezer is (as well as their fridge).  I bought a device to show me the temps and now i keep my freezer at 0F and my fridge at 34F-35F - and I have not had any problems keeping the bowl cold enough to freeze up the cream.  So easy and fast - as well as fresh good ingredients have made possessing this machine a delight.  I highly recommend it as well as recommending all of us periodically checking the temps in both our freezers and fridges.There are 2 main reasons for failure to get the ice cream to freeze - first is your freezer is not cold enough to freeze the bowl through and through.  The 2nd reason is inappropriate ingredients that prevent the cream from freezing.  Some of these ingredients are anything with alcohol, fresh citrus fruits (orange, lemon, grapefruit, etc) and kiwi - amongst some others.  Seems to me that anything that will prevent jello from 'setting' will also prevent ice cream from freezing properly.  The ice cream when it is done will also not be hard, like the ice cream you get in stores, but of the soft variety that you get from like a Diary Queen - soft ice cream.  If you want it firmer or harder, put it into a different container and put it back in the freezer.  Now get creative and enjoy the fruits of your labors :)",positive
"I received this item for Christmas.  I wanted it so I could make more natural ice cream without all those additives.  I used a simple recipe from off the web: Some whole milk, condesed milk, and cocoa powder.  At first it was a failure because I only froze the container for 5 hours.  It didn't swish when I shook it, so I thought I was good to go.  After nearly 2 hours I just had cold ingrediants.  I put them in the fridge and froze the container overnight and restarted in the morning.  After only 30 minutes I had some of the most amazing ice cream I have ever had.  I will never buy ice cream from the store again.  This ice cream maker is awesome, I love it.",positive
"This machine works pretty well but after using it a couple times you will wish they had sense enough to provide a cover for the bowl for when it's in the freezer. The bowl is so large around that I have not been able to find anything to fit it and must resort to plastic wrap or tin foil. This is EXTREMELY annoying and almost enough to make me wish I didn't buy it, you can't clean the bowl when it is frozen. The way the bowl is manufactured a standard snap cover would work on it, it would have been simple and cheap for them to provide one. I would have liked a cover for it while it's in operation too, the top is open and I like things covered so nothing falls in while making the ice cream. It could have been designed with one cover for both. The feet are also poorly designed, the rubber feet are too short and slide all the way into their holes so it can sit on plastic and be hard to level. This machine is the kind of design that makes you wonder if they ever tested it before manufacturing it.Still, for the price it works well and if it had a cover and properly designed feet it would rate another star.",positive
"For years I had one of the ice cream makers where you layered ice and salt in the bucket and began the process of churing ice cream.  I can tell you that after 8 years or so of owning this type of machine I made ice cream 3 times.  It was messy, clean up was a pain and it was noisy.  After my machine was ruined by a leaky roof (divine intervention) I looked around and decided to purchase the cuisinart ice cream machine.  Since owning this maching I have made ice cream atleast once a week.  I have even made ice cream to go with dessert for a dinner for 75 people.  Something I would have never have done with my old machine.The machine is easy to use, easy to clean and in my opinion not very noisy. Some of the reviewers mentioned noise, they must have never heard the noise produced by tradtional ice cream machines that have a motor. It is about the level of a food processor or blender.  perhaps because it is running for 25 minutes it seems louder to some people.As to problems of the machine not freezing properly, I can only say I have not had any problems.  I keep the bowl in my freezer and chill the ice cream and sorbet mixtures well before pouring them into the machine to begin churning.  I highly recommend buying an extra bowl if you need to make more than 1 1/2 quarts at a time. With my ""old fashioned"" ice cream machine (salt and water), they always recommended ripening the ice cream and I continue to do so.  Once churned, I turn my newly made ice cream into a differenct container and pop it into my freezer for 30 to 60 minutes at least before eating.  I have never gotten really firm ice cream out of anything but an industrial machine and I did not expect it with this one although my nieces think it is just fine straight from the bucket.With the Cuisinart icecream maker, making ice cream is fun and very satisfying.  Best of all, I did not break the bank to get good results.  Although I love the end results on some of the pricer ice cream machines, my Dr. Pepper pockets could not come up with the Champagne cost of those $100.00 or more icecream makers. I was ready say to myself, this machine is not bad for the price and I ended up thinking this machine works well and what a great price.My only issue is more with Amazon.  I am unsure were the $90.00 original sticker price came from. At the cuisinart site you can purchase the same machine for $49.95 just like here at Amazon.  I purchased mine through Amazon due to their great customer service but it seems very misleading and unnecessary for them to mark it up just to give the impression you are saving money by purchasing at the amazon site.",positive
"I used to own a White Mountain hand crank ice cream maker -- I figured that was the only ""real"" way to make ice cream, rock salt and all. I bought this device and raced them head to head and the next week the hand crank maker was out by the curb for trash collection!This thing works GREAT! Use your imagination and try some fresh fruit sorbets, make a simple syrup and then freeze it with lime juice, for instance -- it's incredible! I find that using instant espresso powder gives me a real coffee flavor kick when I make coffee ice cream. And there's a recipe in the included booklet for Jell-O Pudding Ice Cream, which my kids rave about.I found some apricot juice at the market and used it in the ice cream maker -- it turned out some gourmet-like apricot sorbet! WOW!!!I tend to avoid the heavy cream called for in the recipes and use at most half and half with milk. Too much milkfat tastes gross. Too little tastes icy and awful.It's simple, it works well, it's not all that expensive and the ice cream you'll make is easily better than the most expensive storebought ice cream available! The machine has a small footprint and the only noise it makes is kind of a ""rawr rawr rawr"" as it rotates the central vessel. All you have to do is mix the ice cream base, pour it in the machine and flip the switch!",positive
"It takes a little practice to get used to what works and what doesn't with this Ice Cream Maker. For the price though, it is really good. I messed up my first few recipes by over filling the thing. Eventually, I was making my own delicious ice creams and sorbets. So much fun during the summer! My kids were thrilled! ;)",positive
We are very happy with this ice cream maker.  Nice and easy to use.  It makes delicious ice cream.  We have no negative comments on this machine.  Would definitely recommend to others.,positive
"I was on the fence about getting an ice cream maker because I figured it would break shortly after using it, but I decided to go for it. I've had my ice cream maker for about a week now and I have used it 3 times and so far, so good! It only takes about 20 minutes to make delicious ice cream or sorbets. Some of the recipes in the booklet (and in other recipes online or in other books) might require some additional prep work. The ice cream maker makes 1-1/2 quarts which is more than enough for my husband and I to enjoy. It's quick, easy and contains less preservatives than store bought.The only issue I have with it is the mixing attachment is made of plastic. It feels like it has to be handled very gingerly or it will snap in two. At times I am concerned that I will make an ice cream that is too thick for it to handle. I hope this thing last a long time so we can get many uses out of it. I'll update if and when it breaks.",positive
"Please, someone tell me what did I not get it right to have this grainy ice cream that stuck to the freeze bowl?It tastes more like a sorbet with all the ingredients I put guided by its manual.And, I am so surprised how much fat and sugar it requires to make an ice cream. Does anyone know how to make a healthy smooth ice cream recipe with low fat or non-fat options?",positive
"This ice cream maker is easy to use, easy to clean and makes delicious ice cream.",positive
"I love frozen yogurt. However, in my neck of the woods, sometimes it is difficult to find decent frozen yogurt that is not filled with sweetners and other additives. I make my own yogurt, and thought I would pick up an ice cream maker and give homemade frozen yogurt a shot.After reading the reviews on Amazon and other places, I was wary about getting the Cuisinart. I was attracted to the high end ice cream  makers, but the cost was way too prohibitive for me. So I thought, what the heck, let me try the Cuisinart - it got much better reviews than the Krups.Well, I just tried my first batch. I was a little skeptical that I would get anything more than soft goo that had been described by other reviewers, especially since I made up my own recipe using evaporated milk and my own homemade yogurt.Wow - it worked like a charm! In 25 minutes, I had a nice soft ice cream that I would be willing to eat right there, but I did put it into a plastic container for further hardening. Since there are no preservatives and it is sweetened to my tastes, the frozen yogurt is clear and bright tasting, without any after taste or gummy feeling on the tongue.I am sooo happy that I have bought this appliance. No more store bought frozen yogurt for me!! I just invested in a bunch of different Sonoma Syrups (I used Meyer Lemon for this batch). Mmmmm.My tips:1. I froze the tub in my deep freezer for 48 hours.2. My ingredients were cold when I added them.3. I took the tub from the freezer, turned it on and immediately added the cold ingredients. I did not allow any time for the tub to warm up.4. I took another reviewer's advice and placed a plate on top of the unit to help keep the tub cold while running.I do not understand why so many have problems with the ingredients not freezing. I could not be more pleased with the results!I would definitely recommend this to others! Just follow the directions, and the whole world of custom frozen desserts opens up - at a very reasonable price!!!!",positive
"We wanted to get an Ice Cream maker so that we could make ""Ice Cream"" with Soy Milk for someone sensitive to dairy products.  We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy.  We have make banana and strawberry ""ice cream"" using soy milk and both have come out perfect.  The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing.  We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original.  We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first.",positive
"I BOUGHT THIS TO HELP ME MAKE DIET DESSERTS I COULD EAT ON A DIET. THIS TURNED OUT TO BE TOOOO GOOD FOR WORDS AND I HAVE SINCE BOUGHT ANOTHER FOR A FRIEND IN MEXICO, WHO CANNOT GET THE SORBETS AND OTHER FROZEN DESSERTS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STORES, AND I HAVE TAUGHT HER TO MAKE THEM WITH THIS MACHINE I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY AND ALL TYPES OF COOKS FOR A QUICK AND WONDERFUL WAY TO MAKE FROZEN DESSERTS.",positive
"WORKS WELL, NOT TOO NOISY, EASY TO CLEAN.  RECOMMEND BUYING EXTRA BOWL IF 1-1/2 QUARTS NOT ENOUGH, OTHERWISE HAVE TO WAIT 24 HOURS FOR BOWL TO RE-FREEZE",positive
"This is the second one of these I've owned. My first one is 3000 moles away at my parents house so I figured it would be cheaper to just buy another. This makes good sorbets and ice creams (though depends on your own recipes to make them good, right?). The freezer part is wonderful and will keep a freeze for a good hour or so. Very simple design that is easy to clean.",positive
"When I got this machine, I put the bowl in my freezer and after 6 hours tried to make some ice cream even though the bowl was not completely frozen.If you read all the other reviews here, you know that it doesnt work that way.You need to freeze this bowl for a very long time before you make your first batch. Like 24 hours or more.Other than that, the machine is great, easy to use and easy to clean.",positive
"This is the first ice cream maker I have purchased, and this seems to have been a good choice.  So far I have made dark chocolate gelato that came out fantastic, and some strawberry frozen yogurt.  After 25-30 minutes in the machine, the consistency and texture are quite good...definitely hard enough to eat immediately.  I wish the recipe book was bigger, but I found the gelato recipe on line (epicurious, I believe) and it worked fine (except the custard is kind of a pain to make, lots of stirring and constant attention...).  After having lived in Italy for a year, I really missed creamy Italian gelato, and so now I have my own way to make it.  And it's also nice because I know exactly what goes into every batch.  After you remove the leftovers to the freezer, it is necessary to let them defrost for a little while before serving them, because the ice cream/yogurt, etc. gets hard (no commercial softeners in there).  Not a big deal though.  This machine is pretty loud, but nothing too unbearable.  I would recommend it for anyone interested in a small, easy to clean, easy to use, ice cream maker.",positive
"I have made sorbets and various full and low fat ice creams. It is easy to use if you follow the directions and easy to clean. It makes a product that is frozen but not hard. Good consistency for eating right away. We store the frozen bowl in the freezer with the bottom side down, it seems to get things a little firmer this way.",positive
"This ice cream maker is easy to use, takes up almost no space, and turns out bowl after bowl of creamy custard based ice creams, light fruit-filled ice creams, and fluffy sorbets all with a minimum of set up or effort.  The bowl goes into the freezer until it has frozen solid (I just leave mine in there all the time so it's frozen when I need it), and in two seconds the base is set up and I'm pouring in French Vanilla Bean ice cream, or champagne citrus sorbet, or fresh peach ice cream with peach chunks.  Sorbet is as easy as grinding up some frest fruit in the food processor or blender, mixing in a simple sugar syrup that takes 5 mins. to make with sugar and water, and optionally adding a little lemon juice or a teaspoon or two of alcohol to give it a softer consistency.  I like adding champagne -- it softens the texture but tastes great as well, giving it an added tanginess that helps keep the sorbet from being too sweet.  Clean-up is a breeze as there are only three parts to clean.  The freezer bowl, the plastic piece that sits inside it, and the top.Seriously, I have not bought commercially made ice cream since I got this maker.  I just go to the market, see what looks freshest , and it's sorbet within a few hours.  Ice creams almost as easy and much better than Steve's, Baskin Robbins, etc.  I can't say enough about this little unit that looks like nothing.  It's sure something!  And at less than $50, it's a bargain.  I've bought them for all my friends.",positive
"Maybe I just got a lemon, judging by all the favorable reviews, but my cuisinart ice cream maker just doesn't work! I was really looking forward to making low-carb ice cream, but, no dice. At the end of the 25-30 minutes, still just totally liquid sweetened half-and-half.  I've kept the freezer bowl in the freezer for a week, used the most basic recipes, even with sugar, just in case that was the problem. I've tried about 6 times with different ingredients, chilling it all, adding flavorings and sweeteners only at the end.  A couple of times I ended up with butter because I just couldn't believe that a cuisinart product could fail so utterly and I just kept it turning. What a disappointment!  On the plus side, I've found I can salvage the ingredients in two ways.  First and simplest, just pour it into popsicle molds and freeze those.  Not creamy in texture, but still a nice frozen treat.  The other method I learned at our local children's science museum.  Put the cream mix into a zip-loc bag.  Tak another large zip-loc bag and put in a couple dozen ice cubes, and 1/3 cup of salt--just regular table salt works totally fine.  Put the yummy bag into the bag of ice. Now shake it for about 10 minutes, until it turns into ice cream.  If you wish, you can use a pair of legging-type pants for a convenient shaker.  Turn the pants half-way inside out, so that one leg is inside the other.  Put the double bag into the middle of the leg, grab both ends and shake. You don't have to shake very vigorously. Check to see how it's coming along every 5 minutes or so.  Once it's frozen, open the salt-water bag, take out the ice cream bag and give it a quick rinse to wash away the salt.  Voila!",positive
"I have wanted one of these for a long time but the price was too high.  Costco finally started carrying them for around $30, so I decided I wasn't out much if I didn't like it.Works great.  I love homemade ice cream but it is such a pain to make, especially since I am single.  The ice cream freezes great if you use an airtight bowl and still tastes freshly made.  Stays pretty soft as well, almost like having tasty soft serve ice cream.  I make the basic vanilla and cut the recipe in half and cut the time down in the machine to about 20 minutes and it works out great for a single person.  You have ice cream to eat on the spot and leftovers for a couple more bowls.One thing I don't like about the recipes in the book is they are all high calorie.  They call for whole milk and heavy cream.  I am going to try the one suggestion next time and use half and half instead of cream and see if that works to cut down on the calories",positive
"I tried this for Dr. Atkins &quot;diet&quot; ice cream (egg custard sweetened with artificial sweetner) and was surprised how well it worked. The freezer is a variation on the popular &quot;Donvier&quot; type ice cream makers with a cold insert that is previously frozen and a churn paddle that stirs the mixture and shell-freezes it to the sides of the cold container. But instead of hand-cranking the shell-frozen ice cream, the Cuisinart has a well-designed paddle that is angled perfectly to scrape the ice cream off the sides as it freezes. In 20 minutes, you have a frozen treat that is ok for low-carb diets if you follow the recipe.A couple of hints; I froze the container well in advance, and after making the ice cream, I washed, dried and froze it again for its next use. The ice cream custard was cooled to room temp and I used a dairy thermometer to measure the temperature. Chilling the custard would have resulted in an even firmer mass, but I was impatient. In either case, non-sugar ice cream will set up very hard in the freezer, so it's best to consume it on the same day you freeze it, and serve it soon after you make it.This is a very economical alternative to expensive freezers with built-in refrigeration, and works much better than the hand version of the device.",positive
"Ok, I am one who will pour through hundreds of reviews before making a purchase. I had a $50 giftcard (for Macy's) and have a strict policy to only use them for something I wouldn't otherwise buy.I have wanted an ice cream maker for years. I would look at them, think about them, and ultimately put them back on the shelves as I thought it was unnecessary in the scheme of life for another small appliance in my too-small kitchen.Well, expiry was upon me with the giftcard (yes, almost 2 years) and I now live in a VERY rural area, where a trip for a container of ice cream is a 40 mile round trip. Did I mention I ADORE ice cream??I finally bought this machine. My husband thought I was crazy and that I'd never use it. Made the first batch of chocolate ice cream yesterday and let me tell you it was fantastic!This will not go unused, my husband won't allow it. We both felt it was as good or better than store purchased ice cream without the chemicals they use to keep it nice for long periods of time in the freezer. Buy your milk and cream in large containers kids, you are going to a)save a little $  and  b) make a motherload of HEALTHIER ice cream. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still delightful.I am on Amazon today to buy an extra freezer container. I do think that is a bit pricey and am considering the whole reconditioned unit so that I can make two batches simultaneously. It's that good.It DOES come out soupy when initially made. It's yummy that way-I dare you to not put a spoon in the top as it's whirring around, especially the first batch. Put it in another plastic container for a couple of hours if you prefer a harder consistency.Oh, as for the noise-come on people, it's NOT that loud!My standing fan makes more noise than this thing, and I'd rather hear IT whirring knowing the sweet treat awaits me!  Honestly, maybe these folks got a faulty unit, or are particularly sensitive to noise- I don't think it's noisy at all :)Only one small note to mention. When it's done try to get it out of the canister quickly because it freezes very quickly to a very hard consistency to the sides, and it takes a bit of scraping with a wooden spoon to get it off (but I had a heck of a taste test while I completed this arduous task)  ! HAHA.Buy it and enjoy, I think folks with kids would have a lot of fun with this machine letting kids come up with their own funky flavors. I know I will.",positive
My daughter bought this item for me and I have used it so much.  It is so easy to use  and it makes delicious ice cream.,positive
"I got this ice cream maker primarily to make sorbets and the occasional batch of ice cream.  The item arrived well packed, accompanied by a very small instruction manual / recipe booklet combination.To get a feel for the machine, I first froze the freezer bowl for 24 hours at zero degrees or less.  My first attempt was a Quince sorbet from ""The Sweet Life"" cookbook.  I pretty much followed the recipe instructions to the letter.  I poured the chilled quince mixture into the frozen bowl with the machine running.  10 minutes passed.  20 minutes.  30 minutes.  40 minutes.  My ""sorbet"" was just a frozen drink.  Eventually, the freezer bowl defrosted and I had a lukewarm smoothie on my hands.Thinking it was my ability to follow a recipe, I decided to try one of the recipes in the instruction manual.  I tried the ""basic vanilla"".  After about 20 minutes of churning, the ice cream started to firm up.  But it never got past the soupy slush stage.  So I waited some more...another 20 minutes.  The ice cream was thicker but still a soupy mess.  After freezing the concoction for 3 hours, it was fine, but more like frozen milk than ice cream.Next, my wife stepped in and tried one of her recipes.  Chocolate ice cream.  Same results for her.  A soupy half-frozen mess.I have lost faith in this machine.  I still think the best and most reliable way to make ice cream is with one of those old style churns.  I just don't think this thing gets cold enough.  My parents have a different model (anotehr brand) and theirs freezes the ice cream within 15 minutes every time.Your mileage may vary, but I would be wary of this machine.",positive
"I will not rehash what everyone else has said, but this ice cream maker is everything I could ask for. It makes ice cream and other frozen treats super fast, is easy to clean, compact, and not too loud. Sure, it's not whisper quiet, but I didn't think the noise level was unbearable and conversation is easy to hear over it. Cuisinart appliances have always seemed to be reliable so let's hope this one is no exception.",positive
Gift recipient loved this product. I already had one and liked it very very much. It is easy to use and the product is great. The red choice made it an even more fun gift. I would suggest getting a second cylinder.  Keep them clean and wrapped in the freezer.,positive
"Highly recommended! I LOVE this ice cream maker. It's so easy and the results are amazing. I like GOOD ice cream (like Haagen-Dazs)and this machine creates stellar ice cream. It rivals any of the best ice cream you can find. Even the basic recipes produce excellent ice cream. I've made mint chip, premium vanilla bean and strawberry. I do recommend using quality dairy products for best results (I use Organic Valley milk and heavy cream). Sorry, Haagen-Dazs. I won't be buying any more ice cream from you!",positive
"This is such a great little ice cream maker.  I've used it countless times since I got it for Christmas two years ago.  It's easy, user-friendly, makes delicious ice cream.  Buy a second freezer bowl to go with it, so you always have a fully-frozen one on hand...especially if you're making more than one flavor or want two batches at once.",positive
"I thought it was a stupid decision - to pay over $50 for an ice cream maker when I don't even care for ice cream that much.  I mean, ice cream is ok, but I rarely purchase it because I'm not crazy about it and even the ""all natural"" ones seem pretty fake to me (tara gum??? what the heck does that taste like?)  I'm a ""real food"" fan, and I like to know what's in it - even my desserts.  Anyway, I didn't hold out much hope when I got it and read the recipes that came with it - I mean, sugary milk is sugary milk (add chocolate, vanilla, etc to spice it up a bit, but no big deal, right?)  Before I made my first batch, I looked up ice cream recipes on the internet and was surprised at the differences in recipes.  Many of the highest rated ones had eggs as an ingredient.  Now we were getting somewhere - eggs add a lot of flavor if you do it right.  So, I made up my own recipe for my first batch of chocolate ice cream.  Oh! My! Gosh!  I have never, ever, ever, had ice cream that tasted so good.  It was the richest, creamiest ice cream.  My husband actually complained that he could only eat a small bowl because it was so rich.  By rich, I mean a deep chocolately flavor - sweet, but not too sweet.  My next recipe I tried (and made up) was Butter Pecan.  Oh! My! Gosh!  My adult son who says he had never had butter pecan ice cream (not sure if that's true - I'm thinking as a kid he may have tasted some) - took one bite and his eyes widened while he just about drooled all over himself - he said that was the best tasting ice cream he had ever had.  The most recent recipe I made was one of the ones in the little booklet that came with the machine - ""simple chocolate ice cream"" - and it is, in flavor and everything.  My husband loves it - because he can eat more of it (it's not rich at all).  But to me, it tastes more like flavored ice milk - it's just not creamy at all.All of the recipes that I have tried have frozen well - I don't get bricks of ice, and just a few minutes of sitting out before I scoop some out makes it really easy to do.So, I guess it wasn't a stupid decision after all - I will definitely get my money's worth out of it.  Here are my two modified recipes for the Chocolate and Butter Pecan if you want to try it for yourself:CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM:3/4 cup cocoa powder (baking cocoa), sifted1/2 cup granulated sugar1/3 cup packed dark brown sugarpinch of salt1 cup half and half2 cups heavy whipping cream3 eggs1/2 tablespoon pure vanilla extractAdd sugar (white and brown), cocoa powder, salt, half & half and heavy cream to a pot, heat over medium-low, stirring constantly, until just bubbly.  Reduce heat.  Put 3 eggs* in a bowl, blend with a fork, then slowly add some of the hot cream mixture to the eggs.  Stir, add a little more, stir - all in all, you want to blend in at least half of the cream mixture.  Then pour it all back in the pot, and slowly increase heat until it just starts to bubble.  Remove from heat, add vanilla, stir.  Cool in refrigerator several hours, then follow machine instructions.___________________________BUTTER PECAN ICE CREAM2 tablespoons butter1 cup pecan halvessalt1 cup half & half3/4 cup granulated sugar2 cups heavy whipping cream3 eggs1 tablespoon pure vanilla extractAdd sugar a pinch of salt, half & half and heavy cream to a pot, heat over medium-low, stirring constantly, until just bubbly.

Stir, add a little more, stir - all in all, you want to blend in at least half of the cream mixture.  Then pour it all back in the pot, and slowly increase heat until it just starts to bubble.  Remove from heat, add vanilla, stir.In a small skillet over medium-low heat, melt butter and add pecans.  Salt the pecans and stir constantly for several minutes to ""roast"" the nuts. (You can be doing this at the same time as making the cream mixture.)Keep cream mixture and nuts separate, and cool both in refrigerator several hours, then follow machine instructions (don't add the nuts until the very last few minutes of making the ice cream.)_____________________________*Note about eggs - I use backyard chicken eggs which I think have a lot to do with the flavor.  I'm also not concerned about salmonella from these.  I don't separate the eggs, and if you do it right, there's no need.  But one time I got side-tracked and the cream mixture got too hot after I added the eggs - which caused the whites to harden like a cooked egg.  I just skimmed the hard whites out with a slotted spoon, and briefly blended with a stick blender (like 2 second blasts) to break up any remaining.  Be careful you don't blend too long if you do this or you'll cream it too soon.__________________________Interestingly, I ordered the ice cream maker pictured here, but was shipped this one instead:Cuisinart ICE 21 Frozen Yogurt Ice Sorbet",positive
"Love, love, LOVE this ice cream maker.  Very easy to use and clean and good basic recipes included in the appliance's booklet.  If you want a lighter ice cream that doesn't have such a fatty aftertaste, however, try 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  I wish Cuisinart would include some vegan options using almond and coconut milk, too.",positive
"Just had our first batch of ice cream from this product. All I can say is ""WOW"". Easy to use, great end results and fun. My husband couldn't tell the difference between this ice cream and the store bought kinds. I would highly recommend this to anyone for ease of use and cleanup.",positive
"This is a very simple machine that does what it's supposed to with very little fuss.  I put the frozen bowl part in our upright freezer at least a few hours before I expect to make ice cream.  I make the custard for the ice cream at the same time.  After dinner, I put the frozen part on the stand, put in the mixing blade and top with the lid.  Then I pour the custard in and 20-30 minutes later we enjoy fresh ice cream with no additives.  If you want ice cream that is harder than soft serve, it will need to ""ripen"" a bit more in your freezer.  But this is a delightful machine that I highly recommend.  I never made ice cream before it, and never want to buy it from a grocery again.",positive
"This product is getting great reviews for good reason. Here are a few tips I've discovered along the way. First, freeze the bowl overnight. Second, chill your ingredients in the freezer for 20 minutes or so to ensure they are thoroughly chilled. Use pure vanilla, not imitation vanilla extract. In doing both of these things, I've found I've been able to create soft serve ice cream, which I then freeze for a couple of hours for a hard serve. In not doing these things, I've found that I create milkshakes, and that ain't bad! It's just not always what one wants. To get good quality ice cream with little hassle is a real treat! My only disappointment? That sorbet isn't low calorie. Amazingly, the recipes in the instruction manual show sorbet and frozen yogurt are on par calorically with homemade ice cream at about 215 calories per 1/2 cup serving. Sugar substitutes could help reduce calories significantly, and I'll experiment with those recipes.",positive
The fruit of this labor has been enjoyed by family and friends who are so glad I went into sharing ice cream.,positive
"This is an excellent little machine that makes just enough icecream for my family and I know exactly what goes in it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the manual states the bowl will be ready between 6 and 22 hours. I tried using it after 6 and 12 hours. At 6 hours it did not do anything with the blended mixture. Obviously it was not frozen enough. At 12 hours, I got the outside of the mixture sticking to the bowl and the core of the mixture not churned/frozen. This may not be an issue for everyone, but with our freezer and our bowl it takes a good 20 to 24 hours of the bowl being in the freezer to get the icecream just right.",positive
"I love this machine!  I am an ice-cream nut, so I'm a little bit biased - but only since this machine makes making ice cream so easy!  You do have to freeze the bowl beforehand, which is a slight inconvenience, but unless you're planning to make a ton of ice cream all at the same time it's no big deal.  It also makes GOOD ice cream - I haven't had a complaint yet! Highly recommend!",positive
"I bought this ice cream maker on Amazon close to two years ago and it is still going strong and making great ice cream! I use it at least twice a week and the ice cream comes out perfect every time. When first made, the ice cream is about the consistency of soft serve or a Wendy's Frosty. That's just fine with me, the flavor is best this way. After freezing whatever is left of the batch, the consistency is like store bought ice cream. I do not do anything fancy with it, just follow the directions in the included booklet for basic vanilla ice cream. In fact, the recipe calls for heavy cream and whole milk but I substitute 1 cup Half & Half and 2 cups low fat (2%) milk to keep it lower cal, and the consistency is still plenty smooth!Like other reviewers have said, be sure to freeze that container for plenty of time before using. Otherwise the ice cream will be real runny. I try to freeze it for 24 hours before use. As long as the directions are followed on this machine, it makes great ice cream every time. Highly recommend it. This is by far my most used kitchen gadget. Love it! Am going to buy another one as a gift right now.",positive
"While I love the ice cream this machine makes, the motor has a lot of problems. On only its second use, the motor hummed and wouldn't start for several minutes. It did this consistently over the next year but would start up after 5 or 10 minutes. However, now the motor just stops halfway through the process because it's overheating too quickly. Maybe I just got a lemon, but this is a pretty poor motor.",positive
"I actually have the red model with 2 freezer inserts.  It's a very simple machine with only 4 parts and is easy to clean.  The only thing you have to remember is to keep the freezer inserts in the freezer and that the ice cream will be soft when finished churning.  I put my finished ice cream in containers in the freezer and they're ready to eat in a couple of hours.  I wasn't all that happy with the recipes I found in the booklet (didn't want to use heavy cream or cook the base) but there are skazillions of recipes on line and after some trial and error I made up my own.  I saw some people complained of the noise, but it's not all that loud and it only churns for 30 minutes.  Here's the link to my ice cream recipe (makes 2 inserts worth of ice cream) if you're interested.  [...]  I am very happy with this purchase.",positive
"This counter-top ice-cream maker works pretty well.  It works best if you make sure that the bowl is 100% frozen solid, which means leaving it in the freezer at least overnight.  Also once you've made your mix, put that in the freezer too for a little while so it's very cold.  I also add the mix to the bowl and then the paddle and then the lid, because if you try to pour it in thru the hole in the lid, like the directions say, you end up with a mess all over the counter.Another thing I've learned is don't even attempt to make the 'kids' ice cream recipe in the book, the one that uses instant pudding mix.  This just makes cement.  You can't eat it and it practically ruined the bowl!  I had to soak it in boiling water and scrape it off with a metal scraper! What a disaster!The easiest, creamiest ice cream recipe is just to use 2 cups heavy cream 1 cup half and half, 3/4 cup fine ground sugar and 2 tbsps of real vanilla extract.  Easy. Creamy. Yummy.  Enjoy!!",positive
"I bought this ice cream maker after I took an Ice Cream, Gelato and Sorbet class at Sur La Table cooking store.  Because we were making so many different types of desserts, we had several ice cream makers working in the classroom at the same time.  This ice cream maker was by far my favorite that day and I bought it about a week later.I liked the ease of adding ingredients through the opening on the top and the size is perfect for me.I have used my new ice cream maker with no problems.  The bowl froze easily (probably in less than 24 hours) in the bottom and back of the freezer.  Within about 20 minutes, I had wonderfully frozen ice cream.I certainly plan on getting more adventurous with my ingredients and do not anticipate any problems with this wonderful machine.",positive
"Buy this ice cream maker!  I considered purchasing an ice cream maker for over 5 years and I FINALLY convinced myself that it was worth it.  I should have bought this years ago.  I originally thought I'd seldom use it, but it's very easy to use and turns out great tasting results!I have no complaints.  I love making desserts and ice cream is easier than baking, and a great way to avoid heating up your kitchen during the summer when you want a homemade dessert.  The recipe book included with the unit has great basic ideas (I especially enjoy the Coffee Ice Cream, I add toffee to mine).  From there, the possibilities are endless!If you can measure, you can make ice cream.  The most basic ice creams have 3 or 4 ingredients and if you are the type who enjoys stopping at expensive ice cream shops for gourmet flavors, this unit will save you money in the long run.  The 1.5 quart capacity makes just enough ice cream for you to satisfy your craving without over-indulging (and maybe share with friends and family!).Oh, yes, the machine is a bit loud, but it only takes 20 minutes to make a batch.  The noise reminds me to keep checking my ice cream to see if it's ""done"".  Doesn't bother me at all.Bottom line... great price, good ice cream, you can't go wrong with this!",positive
"I've made vanilla, strawberry (using fresh strawberries) and chocolate ice cream in this machine and it was all yummy. I just used the recipes that came with the machine. So far, the strawberry was the best. Each batch consistently took 25 minutes to make. It's easy to use and easy to clean. I bought the red unit which adds a fun color to my kitchen when not in use. The opening at the top is also convenient for scooping up a spoonful of ice cream for tasting without turning the unit off. I'm sorry I didn't buy this sooner. I love how simple and easy it is to use. I'm going to start experimenting with my own recipes now that I've got the hang of it.The only very minor downside is that it's a little noisy while it's running so you can't really enjoy a quiet meal and make dessert at the same time unless you can stick it in a another room. But I just make a batch early before dinner and store it in the freezer while we're eating.",positive
"I bought this machine for my husband following the recommendations here. Consequently I also bought him the extra freezing container and two books of recipes,one being the Ben and Jerry's book. So far he has produced several excellent batches of ice cream. We are delighted and impressed! It's so easy and so much fun!",positive

"This is our 2nd Cuisinart ice cream maker. We lost a part on our first during a move, tried a couple alternate brands, and ended up buying another Cuisinart as the other brands just didn't work as well for us.We found that the bowl on this brand seems to freeze more solid, thus making thicker ice cream despite the ambient temperature of the room. The others we used would barely hit super soft serve on hot days, whereas this will get to super thick soft serve.Additionally, it just seems to be more sturdy and the motor isn't quite as loud as the others we'd tried (but it's not whisper soft by any means)In addition, we're dairy free, so have to make non-animal milk ice creams. We reverse engineered coconut bliss coconut ice cream (coconut milk based) and it is incredibly good! Everyone we've made it for has loved it - even die hard ""real"" ice cream fans!Here is our recipe for those interested:Note: This recipe is sized to work in this specific Cuisinart home ice cream maker & makes about a pint and a half or so...one big and one little can of coconut milkvanilla 1 tspagave 3 1/2 tbsp, and 9 drops of stevia (to decrease the overall sugars)4 tbsp cocoa powder (we use raw, organic)1/4 tsp Himalayan pink salt1/2 tsp hazelnut or almond extract (makes the overall flavor more rich and full)optional - 2 tbsp of kefir or yogurt (we use coconut milk kefir - gives an added richness)Stir all in a bowl until well mixed, add to ice cream maker bowl, turn on and proceed as usual.  YUM!!(no cooking or creepy ingredients required!)",positive
"I inherited one of these that was my grandma's and I am already thinking of buying a second bowl since I have been making ice cream so frequently. This is just as easy as running to the store and buying a carton of additive-packed ice cream. Freeze the bowl, mix your ingredients, fire it up, add your mixture, blend-blend-blend, ice cream. The owner's manual comes with many recipes and with sites like Pinterest I have discovered many more. One of my favorites is 1 cup frozen pink lemonade concentrate, 3 cups milk, and 3 tbsp Splenda for a tangy frozen treat. I use fat free milk, so I tend to get 'icier' blends than using full fat milk for creamier results, but softening at room temp for a minute or two makes it very easy to scoop and a batch lasts about a week (mostly because it is my daily treat). A tip: do not use a metal sppon to scrape the bowl, it will leave unsightly scratch marks. Hopefully I did not ruin my bowl by doing that.",positive
"If you want a frustrating failed experience trying to make ice cream, buy this ICE-20.  The most critical part, the paddle, is made of pure junk plastic. It is as strong as an ice cream stick and breaks just as easily.Cuisinart has no business marketing such inferior trash to the public.They have sullied their reputation with the ICE-20.",positive
"I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.  Also, I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.  It's so simple that my kids can mix the 4 ingredients in the blender, pour it into the frozen bowl, turn it on, & 25 minutes later, you've got delicious ice cream.  Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.  We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night.",positive
I bought 2 of these so I would always have one chilled and ready to go. I really like how fast it makes ice cream. I use both of the bowls and keep the second unit in storage as a replacement when this one wears out. Its not that much more to buy 2 units compared with buying an extra freezer bowl. So I should be making frozen desserts for years.I also make frozen yogurt and pudding ice cream. The texture is just right when its finished. I added frozen fruit at the end and it was great.It does get firmer if you put it into the freezer. So I put it into individual portions and that way I don't have to deal with a block.Clean up is easy,positive
thats how good this is. i gave it to my sister after gaining a few pounds of making delicioso ice cream for one summer. my favorite is vanilla bean. this machine works and it is inexpensive and its awesome to be able to make ice cream in my own home. I will get an updated model of this next summer (after i workout intensely for 3 months).,positive
"I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year. It's easy to use, makes great ice cream, and the design is simple, so there aren't many complicated mechanical things going on that are in danger of screwing up. It was a great price, and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of. If you want to control the fat/carb/preservative/etc. content, you can do that (but why would you WANT to?!?).Be prepared to make space in your freezer for the bowl and for your collection of home made ice cream. Within a day or two of buying this, I had about 5 or 6 different flavors in the freezer.Pros- easy to use, easy to clean, simple design, great priceCons- freezer bowl can hog limited freezer space",positive
"I really was not expecting the quality of product I received in the Cuisinart ICE-20R Ice Cream Maker... I was buying on the name recognition only, best price, and expected a glorified toy.  But, this little machine is not only cute... it is EASY to use and delivers! It's truly a professional kitchen appliance that works like a charm!  In addition, it is easy to use... just pour in the recipe... flip the switch... 25 minutes later you're eating the real deal.",positive
"I was SO EXCITED when I received this in the mail because I'm vegan and in order to have great and wonderful ice cream flavors - I have to make them.  In the first few months - I must have tried about a dozen recipes - some good and some bad, but none were any fault of this ice cream maker.  Once I learned that you have to put the freezing compartment in the BACK of the freezer and make sure it stays there for at least a couple days between uses - I no longer had soupy ice cream.  Once I learned that you absolutely have to have a decent fat source in every recipe (no low-cal stuff here) - I no longer had hard ice cream that needed an ice pick to be chipped out.  From chocolate candy cane, to cinnamon apple crumble, to avocado (yes!) - this ice cream maker helped my vegan ice cream dreams come true.  I gave only 4 stars simply because, with this design, there is no way to prevent ice cream from gathering on the edges and keeping the middle from getting as cold as it could.  With better side-scrapers or some kind of middle-freeze-chamber - it could be better.",positive
"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use, and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt, I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet, tart yet sweet, yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again.",positive
"Without a doubt, this is a great appliance!  Mine was a gift, but Amazon's price is the best (as is the service).  It works exactly as Cuisinart says it will and what more can you ask than honesty.The bowl freezes quickly in my upright freezer.  Some reviews say their bowl never freezes solid.  Perhaps their freezers need adjusting?  In fact, after making ice cream (about 20 minutes) my bowl is still mostly frozen.Recipes do not seem to be as important as when baking, so don't be afraid to try something innovative.  Start with a proven recipe to get the feel of it, then improvise.We are healthy eaters.  It's nice to know the ingredients I'm using are healthy.  It's also nice to be able to adjust the sweetness to our liking.Have fun!",positive
"I and my family have had a blast with this ice cream maker! We have been making up some of our own recipes as well as using those supplied with the machine and some from Ben & Jerry's recipe book. The savings over store bought ice cream is phenomenal too. I only have one small exception to our ""eye blasting red"" ice cream maker (and it is indeed a small exception). It could be perhaps be a bit quieter... On the other hand, it is readily apparent by the change in the ""noise"" the machine makes, that your delectable treat is ready to decant!GET IT, MAKE IT, LOVE IT...  then do it again!",positive
I bought this for my elderly mother and she loves it!  It's working wonderfuly and making some fantastic ice cream.  She can see it make the ice cream from the top.  I'm sure it would be fun for kids to watch as well.  No problems at all with it.  Everyone should have one of these.,positive
"The cream seems to freeze the the sides really quickly, which makes the top do this crazy clunky noise that seems.... wrong. Plus the ice cream doesn't always turn out perfect. Which could be a user error.... So keep that in mind!",positive
"Do not buy this piece of crap. It's a waste of money. Yes, in theory, it can make ice cream, but not the ice cream that's worth the time and effort. I consistently got batches of ice cream that were ""icy."" NO, this was not a temperature problem. I would chill my custard for well over a day, and I would leave the bowl in the freezer for weeks. So, if you're looking for an ice cream that will not knock your socks off, this is not the machine. If you want something that will make quick ""icy"" ice cream, then this is your machine. You're better off with the old ice and rock salt ice cram makers; at least those machines can make ice cream that's smooth. Incredibly poor designing by cuisinart. I expect better from them; the paddle design seems to be the crux of the problem. The paddle doesn't adequately scrap the sides of the bowl.  Also, I can't believe how many people have actually said they liked this thing. Low expectations I guess.",positive
"Take some chocolate milk, cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out, no ice - just some great, smooth, wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made, you just rinse the bowl with hot water, dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far.",positive
"One of the best things about homemade ice cream and ice is that they seem to encourage people to join in making them. When I first started using mine for dinner parties, I would apologetically excuse myself, duck in the kitchen, muffle the noise of the freezer with a towel and scoot back every so often to check on progress.What I discovered was that people like to gather around the thing while it's running, so now I simply hand people a drink while I get the ingredients and we all stand around watching dessert happen.This last-minute approach has another advantage: it gives you incredible freedom when it comes to recipes. You see, the chemistry of freezing foods has its own set of built-in limits. You need to add appropriate amounts of sugar and alcohol to lower the freezing point of your mixture so that you get an ice and not an ice cube*.Making your ice just before you serve it allows you a lot of freedom. Since you'll be serving it right away, you can stop the machine whenever the mixture looks right. The whole process is really easy, so if you buy an extra bowl, you can experiment with  different flavors in one meal or even try some unsweetened ices in the middle of a meal. (Cucumber puree frozen with mint in the middle of a July 4th dinner turns out to be a million times better than it sounds.)Be sure to allow enough time beforehand  for bowls to chill in the freezer and make sure all ingredients are cold before you start.Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine*A great source of explanation of freezing foods and some recipes is Harold McGee's The Curious Cook.",positive
"I have purchased this ice-cream maker refurbished from Amazon.com and it works great.  It is very quiet (a bit louder than your average microwave) and doesn't take up much counter space.  However, it is definitely not for impulse ice-cream eaters.  You have to pre-freeze the maker's bowl for about 12 hours prior to making ice-cream and all the ingredients you pour into the maker have to be chilled for at least an hour or two, and then it takes about half an hour to an hour for the ice-cream to solidify.The maker comes with a small instruction booklet and some recipes.  The recipes are by no means plentiful but offer an idea how to make good ice-cream.  If you know anything about cooking, it won't be too hard for you to figure out new recipes, but if you don't, you can always buy one of the ice-cream recipe books.The good thing about this maker is that you control exactly what goes into your ice-cream, so it's an alternative if you're on a diet (whether to lose weight or just can't eat walnuts).  If make the ingredients before making dinner and have the bowl pre-frozen, you can let the ice-cream set during your dinner and end up having a nice dessert afterwards.  It's great family fun, from what I hear.The only downside though is that most ice-cream you make in this maker comes out a bit too soft and requires further freezing in the freezer (about 2 hours).  So if you like your ice-cream vey solid, you are probably better off just getting a pint of Ben & Jerry's.",positive
"First, this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review, but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is, I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says, because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh, and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream, and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching, this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!",positive
"I am adding comments on 7/27/08 to my original from April 2006:  If I only used this machine once a year, it would deserve the space it occupies on my kitchen counter.  I probably only use it about 3-4 times a year, but I could not do without it.  I just finished making Nigella Lawson's (Food TV) Margarita ice cream.  If you have any doubts about an ice cream maker, get that recipe and try it, you'll be glad you got the ice cream machine.  Again, I recommend the Ben & Jerry's ice cream recipe book to go with it!------------------------------I never knew ice cream could be so easy.  Someone at work shared his Ben & Jerry's book with me, which inspired me to get the ice cream maker.  I love this machine.  Seemed like it used to take all afternoon to crank that hand ice cream maker (back in the day) when I was a kid, now this machine does it in under 30 minutes.  I feel like Rachel Ray!  Since half gallons of ice cream at the grocery store have gone down to 56 ounces, I'd just as soon spend my money for the ingredients to make my own.My first batch was strawberry, from the Cuisinart recipe book that came with the machine.  It was wonderful.  Just be sure to have your bowl good and frozen, one batch i had to do twice because i only left the bowl in the freezer for 18-20 hours.  Reviewer B. Pfahnl ""bpfahnl"" suggested putting a ziploc bag of ice cubes in the bowl when you have it in the freezer -- excellent suggestion.I do try making half batches since I live alone and don't need a quart and a half of ice cream at a time.  Because of the price and fat in heavy whipping cream, I use part half and half.  Still good ice cream.  And another colleague at work suggested using 1/4 cup or so of Dream Whip for smoothness.  Jury still out on that one.But it's all good.  Seems like you can't go wrong.  If you don't have one yet, hurry!  Before summer gets here and you really want a delicious bowl of homemake ice cream!",positive
"Works great...6 cups is perfect for husband and I, never been sorry for purchase.  Being Cuisinart and red helps too.I use all my recipes for the ice creams that I used years ago in the old hand crank and crushed ice  makers.",positive
"I just received this yesterday, and after freezing the container for 6 hours we tried a batch of frozen yogurt.  I was a little apprehensive, since I'd read reviews where people were unable to get good results even after freezing the unit for 24 hours.  My first batch worked flawlessly!  The machine was quiet, operated smoothly, and it was soooo simple!  I am going to buy an extra freezing cannister so we can do two batches back-to-back.  We've been using our old electric rock salt machine, but now we'll probably get rid of it.  Also, due to the ease of using this Cuisinart maker, we'll make more of our own ice cream more often.  I recommend it.",positive
"The only bad thing about this ice cream maker is that it is so easy to use and the ice cream it makes is so delicious that you may find yourself making a fresh batch of ice cream a couple of times a week - and that may show up on your backside like it has mine!Seriously - with no ice or salt to mess with it is VERY easy to use.  The key to this maker is the cylinder which has walls filled with anti-freeze.  You put the cylinder into the freezer long enough to freeze it, then just put your favorite ice cream recipe into the turning cylinder and 20 minutes later you have ice cream heaven!  There's even an alarm that goes off a few minutes before the end that signals to you the time to add goodies - nuts, chocolate chips, fruit, or whatever you like.***ONE WORD OF WARNING ABOUT THE OPERATION***: If you do like I did and ignore the instructions you may be delayed in making your first batch:  You HAVE to start the machine (and turning the cylinder with the spatula inside) BEFORE you pour in your ice cream mix - if you DON'T the liquid will freeze in just a few seconds, locking the spatula (and the cylinder) in place, and when you go to start the machine - it won't.It is incredibly easy to clean as well - pretty much just the smooth-walled cylinder and the plastic spatula, then just put the cylinder back into the freezer and it's ready to make your NEXT batch.The texture of the ice cream that comes from this maker even seems smoother and ""ice creamier"" than what I've seen from any other variety of home-use ice cream machines.Great ice cream, easy to use, easy to clean - pretty doggone inexpensive.  If you have any inclination to make your own ice cream, this is the machine to have, in my humble opinion.",positive
"Can I say more?  Well, this neat little ice cream maker doesn't take up much space on the counter when in use &amp; stores easily -- the base is no wider in diameter than a dinner plate.  The metal container portion of the ice cream maker has hollow walls that are filled with a fluid. After having it in the freezer overnight, when it's thoroughly frozen, you put it on the base, fill it with the ingredients for whatever flavor of ice cream you desire, put the mixing blade in and the top on then flip the switch. About a half hour to an hour later you have fresh delicious ice cream!  It's that simple. You can cover the original container and slip it in the freezer for later, or you can dish it out and wash and refreeze the container -- it is very easy to clean. Also, by the way, it's the best ice cream you'll ever have. Buy this as I did and you won't be sorry.",positive
"I greatly enjoyed a Donvier back when they were popular...this product is similar, but with the nice extra feature of doing the stirring for you! Like other reviewers have said, you need to be sure the freezer bowl is frozen solid before starting...I would put it in a freezer on a very cold setting for at least 24 hours. Refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours. I usually run the ice cream maker until the ice cream is too hard for it to easily stir, and then take the freezer bowl out, cover it with foil and put it back in the freezer to get extra hard before serving. It comes out great, I have very little problem with ice crystals forming.",positive
"I've had my Cuisinart ice cream maker for 5 years now and am still delighted with it!  I even bought an extra freezer bowl in case I want to make 2 flavors the same day.  I do make sure to stop the freezer after 20-25 minutes of operation or the ice cream will start to soften.  And I learned early on to chill the ingredients OVERNIGHT or the ice cream won't freeze - just gets thick.  But it's a great item, and doesn't take up much space on the counter. I'm especially happy with it since I can't eat regular ice cream because of lactose intolerance.  So I use liquid nondairy creamer to make ice cream in this freezer and it's very satisfactory!",positive
"... is home-made ice cream. I am extremely pleased with my purchase of this simple but amazing unit. No mess, quick, easy, home made ice cream. Once you've tasted your first scoop you'll be addicted. Great for frozen drinks, too, including alcoholic drinks like pina colada and frozen Jack 'n coke.Solid construction, powerful motor. It's noisy but not too much.The ice cream from this (or any) ice cream maker comes out soft serve, but it's really true, if you put the ice cream in the freezer for another 1-2 hours, it hardens to the exact same consistency as store-bought ice cream. It's surprising the first time you try this, because you think it'll come out solid like a block of ice, but it doesn't - it's soft but scoopable.",positive
"The best and fastest way to make excellent ice cream and sorbet. Wonderful product!!!!!!!!!Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker, White",positive
"I ordered the Cuisinart Ice Cream maker after reading all of the reviews on Amazon and it is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  To be honest, I thought that making home-made ice cream would be just too  difficult, but with the Cuisinart, I've made it three times in the past  week.  You simple mix-up the ingredients, chill, and then pour into the  pre-frozen bowl.  Perfect every time.  I highly recommend the book,  &quot;Gelato! : Italian Ice Cream, Sorbetti &amp; Granite&quot; by Pamela  Sheldon Johns as a great add-on.  I ordered the book with the hope of being  able to duplicate the Stracciatella(?) Gelato I had while on vacation in  Italy.  The recipe was simple (heavy cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, and  shaved chocolate) and the results were fabulous.This machine would  make a great gift as well!",positive
"It works perfectly. The batch is enough for a family, well assuming everybody get a regular size cup. You have to freeze the container for a day, but it is an unexpensive machine compare to those freezer units which cost a lot more.",positive
"I bought mine at bed, bath & beyond for $ 40.00. This is the best ice cream I have ever tasted.The ice cream comes out soft serve, but if you will freeze for a few hours it comes out hard just like store bought.My kids love the lemon sorbets. I would buy this product again & again.",positive
"Soft serve at best is what this unit does. I followed the instructions to the letter. The freezer container was kept at 0 degrees for &#62;24 hours. The mix was kept in the frid for 6 hours to hopefully assist in keeping things cold. The unit works well and within 15 minutes I had a nice batch of soft serve. However all the unit does is save you the trouble of mixing the batch by hand. I think Ice Cream means it shouldn't flow out of the container until it melts. This it pour-able into a dish. On a hot day of say 85 degrees, this wouldn't last long enough to lick a cone of it before it was running down your arm. I can deal with hand mixing from now on and placing the batch in the freezer and waiting.",positive
"I picked this up at the start of summer. i've made quite a few batches of ice cream. My favorites come from the Ben & Jerry cook book. There are a lot of benefits from making your own ice cream. it's cheaper. It's rewarding. It's healthier too. Even if you make the most decadent ice creams, you're still using all natural ingredients with no preservatives.There are some tricks to this machine that greatly help performance.#1 Make sure the bowl is frozen. Leave it overnight. Shake it and if anything sloshes, it's not ready.#2 Chill all ingredients. Even if the ingredients just came from the fridge, put the batter back in. I test my batter to make sure it's 35-38 degrees before starting. This will make the freezing process more gradual, which means the ice crystals will be smaller. Small crystals mean a smoother texture.#3 I let the machine work until there's little or no movement in the ice cream. This depends on how much you've got in the machine, but my recipes make the ice cream expand up above the lip of the container. When ice cream forms over the paddle and doesn't get folded back in, that's when I turn it off.#4 Let it firm up in the freezer for 4-6 hours. IT WILL BE SOFT, maybe even runny, out of the machine. I try to avoid runny, so next time either let the machine run longer or your kitchen may be too warm. Why is runny bad?  Runny is liquid and you want to try and keep air in the ice cream, so the firmer it is going in, the better. Get it in the freezer fast. Also resist the urge to pack the ice cream down, with either a utensil or by dropping it on the counter. A smooth surface may look nice, but you want to keep air in the ice cream. The air is what makes it easy to scoop and gives it a good texture.#5 Put the bowl in a plastic bag while in freezer. This keep the frost out and improves taste. Make sure it's completely dry before going back in the freezer.#6 I'd also recommend going all out and using rich cream batters. These have the least water and will have the best texture. I'd prefer one scoop of really good ice cream to 4 of a crappy sorbet.#7 Add solid stuff near the end. Wait until the last 1/2 of freezing to add your berries, chips, etc. This will help to evenly distribute stuff throughout the mixture. I like to make strawberry, so I mash my berries, drizzle in the juice, then put the mush in during the last 1/2 of the cycle.#8 Store ice cream in an air tight container with plastic wrap pushed down to the surface. I use 1.5 quart Rubbermade  containers. They fit perfectly and allow the least amount of freezer air to touch the ice cream. Fat easily obsorbs oders and can make your ice cream taste funky. You could just keep it in the bowl, but I wouldn't do that unless you plan to eat it all later that day. Plus, the sooner you get the bowl clean and back in the freezer, the sooner you can make more ice cream!I've used a GE model that had two speeds. The slower speed seemed to freeze better. I also know of some machines that have a reverse function. I would be interested in checking these out if this one ever dies.Mine came with an extra bowl, which is nice to have one always frozen.In all, a great purchase and a pretty good price. Haven't bought ice cream from the store since.",positive
"In a cooking class, I shared a table with a lady who regaled me with all the different flavors of ice cream she experimented with. That idea appealed to me so that I went straight to Amazon and bought my first ice cream maker. Just two days ago, my Cuisanart Ice Cream Maker (1 1/2 quart) arrived and the freezer bowl went straight into the freezer.  This ice cream maker is very easy to use and comes with very clear instructions. I discovered that you must follow the instructions exactly.  The ""blade"" must be seated in the bowl, the lid put on, and the power turned on in that exact sequence before pouring the ""batter"" into the freezer bowl.  If that sequence is not followed the lid won't fit properly.  One of the real plus factors of this product is that it is easy to make only a pint at a time, since I am experimenting with a variety of flavors.  The fact that the ice cream is soft when finished is also a plus factor for me because it is then easy to pour the ice cream into my pint containers. If the finished product were as solid as it becomes after going back into the freezer, it would be too hard to get the ice cream out of the freezer bowl and into the pint containers.  I have make five pint batches of ice cream in seven days and couldn't be happier with this maker.",positive
"This was a good purchase and the recipe book is great! I've made half of them now; some were awesome, some good, some didn't work. The only negative was that it was pretty loud and it got hot around the base after 10 minutes or so, which I found strange. An ice cream maker shouldn't get hot! The ice cream is still really yummy, but the machine could use a few mechanical tweeks. Overall, for $60, it does the job and there haven't been any major problems!",positive
"I purchased this ice cream maker so that my husband and I can enjoy low or no carb ice cream. It makes the best ice cream, easy clean up. The one thing I did wrong the first time I attempted to use it was to pour the mix in BEFORE turning on the machine---NOT VERY SMART! The mixture froze along the bottom and sides in no time, and my machine jammed. After that first fiasco, my homemade ice cream has been yummy!",positive
Use your favorite soda to make great slushies.  No diet though. It doesn't work. Needs sugar to keep it loose.  My kids love it!!!!You could even use Lemonade flavored with sugar or for adults frozen Marguarita's.  We love our Ice Cream Maker!,positive
"This is a great little machine.  Without the hassle of using ice or salt, you're always ready to whip up some homemade ice cream!  I've made variations of vanilla, eggnog, lemon, cinnamon, dulce de leche, and others in this.  This machine makes ice-cream making SO much fun. I highly recommend this!",positive
"I would not recommend buying this ice cream maker.  It is made entirely out of cheap plastic and the motor sounds like a dentist drill.  Even the canister is made out of plastic and now there are scratches in it from when I scooped the ice cream out with a metal spoon.  I followed the directions exactly and after 1 hour it was still liquid.The next time I used it (again having the canister in the freezer for 24 hours prior to making the recipe), I put the mixture in the canister and then put it in the freezer and covered it with tin foil.  I hand-stirred the mixture every 10 minutes and after 1 hour, it was done.Instead of buying this product, I would recommend mixing the ingredients together and then putting it in a plain plastic container directly in the freezer.  It will take 8-10 hours for it to harden.  You can use the following recipe to start:10 oz plain frozen strawberries (slightly thawed)1/2 cup sugar10 oz heavy whipping creamPuree the strawberries and sugar.  Mix in the whipping cream with the other ingredients for about 2 minutes or until the whipping cream thickens.  Pour into a plastic container and place in the freezer.  You may wish to stir the mixture every 2 hours so that it hardens more quickly.",positive
"Great, quick machine.  A little noisy, but similar to most ice cream machines...except makes fresh ice cream in 20-30 minutes!",positive
"I bought this for my husband who is an ice cream junkie! We have both made ice cream the old fashioned way and the Cuisinart is so easy! We keep the bowl in the freezer ready to go! The bowl does need to freeze at least overnight. We run the ice cream maker for 30 min. It makes a nice soft serve ice cream, if you want it firmer put it in a container the freezer. The unit cleans up easily. I give this 5 stars!",positive
"All you need to know is that mine broke the first time I used it. The clear top didn't fit on the base and when I went to dismantle the inner arm it broke in my hands.It may have been defective.  I don't know.  But, I certainly wouldn't recommend it.",positive
"I was impressed with the sale price, so I bought this on a whim. An ice cream maker rookie, I was rather skeptical by the ease-of-use claims. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the product *is* easy to use and makes yummy desserts in a very short period of time [Freezing Time + 10 Minutes (Prep) + 25 Minutes (Machine)].In order to make frozen desserts (anything from ice milk to margaritas), all you have to do is freeze the bowl, assemble the machine, pour in your ingredients and turn it on. That's it.Notes:- The instruction book contains a few basic recipies, including vanilla ice cream and sherbet, to get you started. This is helpful if you want to make a batch right away.- Watch the proportions in the recipies, as they are not exact. You may want to taste your mixture before putting it into the machine. (For example, the &quot;Very Berry Frozen Yogurt&quot; recipe featured in the book asked for only a 1/4 cup of sugar -- far too little.)- The machine is *considerably* louder than you may expect. (Think blender &amp; old diswasher combined!) It would be prudent to make ice cream *before* guests come over -- or else you'll all be yelling over the din.- The machine contains no small or sharp parts. As such, small children (with your supervision) can use this to try out their cooking skills.Enjoy!",positive
"After reading the reviews of this ice cream maker here on amazon, I decided to give it a try - after making sure my freezer was under 0 degrees, which it was.  As soon as it arrived, I cleaned the bucket and put it in the freezer, and checked the parts.  Sure, it's a bit plasticky, but that's okay with me.  Then found a recipe for sorbet, made the base and put it in the fridge.  Two hours before churning, I put the base in the freezer.After reading so many complaints about the noise, I expected something  between a vacuum cleaner and an airplane. That's why I was very pleasantly surprised at how quiet the unit is.  I talked to my son on my cell phone right next to it while it was running, and I had no problem hearing him.  Sure, it makes some noise, but nothing like a blender and quieter than our kitchen fan on medium.After 20 minutes, I checked and the mixture was thickening, so I gave it another 20 minutes.  When I was finished, my mixture had the texture of a thick milkshake, so I popped it in the freezer and it hardened right up.  After 20 minutes, the bucket was still very cold even though it was over 80 in the house.So far, so good.  I'm very happy with my ice cream maker, and look forward to a summer of icy treats :)",positive
I ordered this RED ice cream maker to give to my husband's daughter and family for Christmas along with a RED quesadilla maker.  I ordered the Cuisinart because a friend has the stainless one and really brags about it - makes ice cream 2 or 3 times a week - says it is EASY and GOOD!  I just know that they will have a great family time together making ice cream with the RED ice cream maker and the color couldn't be any better for a Christmas gift!  And - yes - I shop early so there's not such a rush around Christmas time!,positive
"LOVE this ice cream maker.  I keep the bowl in the freezer in a plastic bag as recommended so it's ready when we are. Doesn't take up much room. It's the perfect size for my husband and me.  Have used the basic vanilla receipe in the instruction book with excellent results.  IT's SO EASY! I like that the top is open so I can add things, like fresh strawberries to the batch as it freezes.  I admit I wasn't sure it would work the first time, it seemed too easy, but sure enough in 25 minutes we were in ice cream heaven.  We like to transfer the ice cream to a tupperware container and stick it in the freezer for an hour or so before eating so it's firmer, but if we can't wait....  I'm sending my daughter one for a gift.  We might use our old salt and ice freezer for a planter or something.",positive
Hard to stay on a diet with this on the counter.  Lots of great recipes and the ice cream and sorbet are yummy!,positive
"I've been making homemade ice cream since 1985 when I got my Waring Ice Cream Parlor machine and the Ben & Jerry book as a birthday present. Twenty-five years later, I donated the Waring machine because I no longer had the patience to bother with all that sloppy ice cube & salty mess! (Machine still worked; donated it to my church). I did tons of online research and hands down, THIS machine got top ratings no matter what site I visited. Some places offer a 2nd bowl for an additional price but I knew I wouldn't need that much ice cream. VERY QUIET and made the 2nd batch of peach ice cream in record time; set timer for 30 minutes, it was done in 18 minutes! Easy to clean, very small to store; bowl is kept permanently in deep freeze at 0 degrees.NOTE: The miniscule Cuisinart recipe book that comes with this states that the bowl will be frozen within 6-12 hours. Don't believe it, we did and almost returned the machine! I checked the canister after 10 hours and it didn't slosh one bit, but after one hour of processing the cream mixture, it was no more frozen than the Equator! Saved the cream mixture to try the next day; froze it for 24 hours, and as I said above, it made a batch in 18 minutes, flat.I've also noticed that although it says ""generous 1.5 quart size"" my recipe for 1 quart of ice cream came so close to the top of the dasher that it actually flowed over a bit. So, I'm going to use slightly less than 1 cup measurements for the liquids when I make the next batches to avoid this problem.So far we've made peach, strawberry and banana ice cream. Try using a high quality buttermilk for 1 cup of the liquid; it's low calorie and adds a nice twang to the end result.",positive
"Yes, upfront I'll say it's a little noisy, but that kind of goes with the territory.  Works perfectly, just as described in the directions.  I keep the bowl in the freezer all the time now.  It doesn't take up as much room as I feared it would.  Makes great ice cream, ice milk, bases for margaritas and sorbets and of course frozen yogurt.  I highly recommend going to the trouble of making a custard based ice cream.  Once you do that you may never make it any other way.  Once you price the ingredients, I cannot honestly say making ice cream is all that much cheaper than buying it, but the quality is far superior to store bought, and you have the added bonus of knowing exactly what is in your ice cream.",positive
"I have tried 4 different recipes in this machine so far.  3 were from the manual that came with the machine, and one was from the internet.  All 3 from the manual did not have very good texture.  The ice cream was not creamy and melty, it was either icy or fudgy.  I like the machine, it is easy to use, but also quite loud.  We ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned.  I think the recipes in the manual could use some improvement so that people don't blame the machine for the ice cream not coming out very well.  The recipe we tried that we got online was most like regular ice cream, but I didn't like that it had uncooked eggs in it.",positive
"This Product turned out to be what I expected based on other's reviews,but it does what it says if you follow the directions carefully.The only thing is that it does not get the ice cream to a solid texture,like soft serve as other's have said,so you can freeze it more within a few hours if preferred as I did.It is slightly noisy but it does not bother me,sound can be compared to a blow dryer on low perhaps but not exact,Other than that minor issue it works pretty good and I intend to use it plenty,also I was glad to purchase it in my favorite color red.",positive
"I have wanted one of these machines for two years. I finally got a great deal on it at Amazon, and snapped it up. Within three days, I had bought the ingredients needed to make strawberry ice cream and couldn't wait to get started.Unfortunately, the instructions are incorrect when it comes to telling you how long to freeze the bowl. It says that you can freeze it for 6-22 hours, or until you shake the bowl and can't hear any liquid sloshing around. So, I froze the bowl for 6 hours and sure enough, no sloshing. But, this is simply not enough! My strawberry ice cream tasted wonderful, but in the machine never made it past a thick liquid stage. I had to put it in the freezer for hours to get it hard enough to eat. The texture suffered, but the flavor was still great.The next time I made ice cream, I froze the bowl for two days while I was out of town. I got some really great Kaluha ice cream out of it, and I've bought a second bowl so I'll always have one ready to make frozen treats.When used correctly, this ice cream maker is wonderful! But used according to the optimistic instructions, all you get is disappointment.",positive
"I've had one for a few weeks now, and many of the positive points of this unit have been mentioned in other reviews... it's convenient, effective, and fun. You chill the aluminum cannister in your freezer until it's frozen, dump the ingredients, and start it up.I would like to address some of the negative comments about &quot;freezing power&quot; and the lack thereof.First, all home ice-cream freezers produce a soft ice cream when they are done... this is normal, and if you read the directions in nearly every ice cream recipe, they will suggest another 2-3 hours in the freezer for the ice cream you make to harden properly. Don't expect to be able to eat it immediately.If you don't remember having to wait this long in your youth, keep in mind that White Mountain / brine-based ice cream churns typically have you &quot;pack&quot; the cannister in the brine after churning. This is much faster way to harden ice cream than putting it in a normal electric freezer because the 0 degree brine is in direct contact with the sides of the ice cream cylinder and conducts heat away much more quickly than the 0 degree air in a freezer. So 15 or 20 extra minutes in the brine may do as much good as 2-3 hours in the freezer.Second, if you end up with &quot;cold soup&quot; rather than ice cream as some have complained, you have one of two problems: either you didn't chill the ingredients in the fridge prior to freezing as reccommended in the instructions, or your freezer is set too warm. A good rule of thumb is that if your freezer is set so that premium ice cream you buy at the store (like Ben & Jerry's or Haagen Dazs) is easily scoopable, it's too warm for (a) long-term food storage, and (b) chilling a cannister. Buy a thermometer and make sure that your freezer is at 0 degrees or colder.My only negative comments about the unit are that the ice cream recipes in the book that comes with it are hit-and-miss. The quick / basic vanilla is quite poor- it would be best described as &quot;vanilla extract&quot; flavored ice cream, and because the milk isn't cooked, the texture and taste are more like a frozen whipped cream. The &quot;premium chocolate&quot; is like eating a frozen truffle... we enjoyed it, but it might be too bittersweet for kids. The sherbets are under-flavored, and the frozen yogurt is extremely yogurty and unlike what you buy commercially. Fortunately, you don't have to use their recipe. I highly recommend Alton Brown's &quot;burned peach&quot; ice cream... a quick google should find it at food.com.",positive
"After several failed attempts, I began to wonder if I would ever be able to make creamy dreamy ice cream at home.  Finally, I ordered the right one!  This ice cream maker really does work.  The only time it will not work is if your freezer is not set to the coldest setting.  I keep the freezer bowls in the freezer at all times, that way they are ready to go.So, set your freezer to the coldest setting two days before you intend to make the ice cream.  I also found the extra freezer bowl to be indispensable.  Instead of waiting for the ice cream mixture to cool, simply use one of the freezer bowls to cool it down and then pour it into the second freezer bowl.  This drastically speeds up the process.I also use the freezer bowl for other items I want to cool down quickly.  I use it to cool down Jello when making a Raspberry Mousse.  I have been known to place the whole contraption right into the freezer.  I guess you are not supposed to, but I am still alive.So, once you have everything all frozen, set the machine up and make sure it is on a nice level surface (in or out of the freezer).  Then, mix up your ice cream recipe.  All you do is pour the liquid into the ice cream maker and with a flick of the switch the paddle starts to turn and in about 20 to 30 minutes you will have the ice cream of your dreams.When washing out the bowl, you will notice that you have to use hot water or you may find the cold water starts to freeze on the inside.  I recommend placing a piece of plastic wrap over the top of the bowl when storing it in the freezer so there is no need to rince the bowl.  I also disobey the instructions and let the ice cream freeze until solid in the ice cream freezer bowl.  I found it just works faster that way.  That way your ice cream is ready in 40 minutes!  Yes, it takes 20-30 minutes and then 10 more minutes in the freezer.  At least that is how it goes in my kitchen.  It is still well worth the wait.  If you start the ice cream before dinner, you won't even notice the time.Here is a favorite recipe for a slushy.  Yes, you can make those too and it works quite well.PINK GRAPEFRUIT SLUSHUse grapefruit juice found in the cooler section of your grocery store or use fresh squeezed and strained juice. If you enjoy sitting outside and want to keep your drinks ice cold, purchase a few ""gel mugs"" which you can keep in the freezer.4 cups pink grapefruit juice1/4 cup orange blossom honey1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract1.  Pour grapefruit juice into a tall jug.  Heat honey in the microwave and stir into juice.2.  Set up ice cream maker.  Pour in juice, freeze 10 minutes or until slushy.  Serve in tall glasses with straws.Makes 4 glasses~The Rebecca Review",positive
"If you use all or mostly heavy cream, don't let the machine run too long.Overall, I'm happy with this machine now that I've figured out its quirks. One problem I had at first was that when I used mostly heavy cream, the finished product was too airy and the ice cream broke apart when I tried to scoop it. My bowl was super cold (overnight, lowest freezer setting) and it got to the ""soft serve"" stage fairly quickly. My mistake was that I left it going too long, hoping it would get firmer. It basically whipped the cream. I don't know if you've ever eaten frozen whipped cream, but it's not a treat! This only happens when bowl is close to zero degrees Farenheit, the mixture is very chilled, and the ambient temperature isn't too hot.If you're wondering what I mean by ""too long,"" it's when the ice cream starts to rise above the churning paddle. If it looks like soft serve but you want it to be harder, transfer the ice cream to another container, cover it, and put it in the freezer.For SUPER SMOOTH ice cream, try one of the recipes that uses eggs and a heated mixture. Very creamy and dense!",positive
"Excellent ice cream maker.  Works as advertised.  Quality is very good.  Product produced, excellent.",positive
We've had a lot of fun and good eating from this machine.  With a little tweaking of the recipes it turns out a really nice product.The ice cream produced is best if eaten fresh.  After it has been in the freezer it becomes a bit too crystalline for my taste.  So we eat it fresh.  This may mean cutting recipes in half but still works fine.,positive
"This is a very good model for making sorbets and ice cream.  It costs more to make ice cream at home than if you buy Hagan-Daaz in the store.  But, if you really like to make your own concoction, than this is really great.  Also, sorbet is super cheap to make with this unit (especially fantastic when berries are in season)...And, if you like a daiquiri or margarita..;) [no point in adding vodka because, of course, it doesn't freeze]).  I made a killer peach sorbet!The booklet also says that it can make yogurt, but, I haven't tried that yet...I may in the future though.The ice cream maker is a bit large, so, it's not really a regular counter-top item.  Also, the insert will take up some room in your freezer and takes time to ice up.  Additionally, you will need to freeze the stainless steel insert in your freezer for at least 6 hours before making a batch.If you really like homemade ice cream, sorbets, margaritas, and yogurt, than you will have a lot of fun with this this unit.Also, comes with some recipe booklet with a some other paperwork.Have fun!",positive
this worked perfect the first three times. then it started not working and i realized because it is not forgiving. you must follow all instructions carefully. you must make sure the custard mixture is thick enough and that it is cooled properly and that the freezer bowl is properly frozen. it makes great ice cream when you follow the instructions carefully.,positive
Makes ice cream! I am on a no carb diet.. but I didn't want to give up my favorite frozen treat. This makes ice cream.. takes maybe 20 minutes.. the ice cream holder itself requires about 24hrs to freeze prior to use. You can of course use it before 24 hours.. but its more like a milkshake.. which is also fine  :)I have never used an ice cream maker before this one. My boyfriend has a self refrigerating one.. he said this one is A LOT quieter.I love it.,positive
"We were somewhat skeptical about how the machine would work but were pleasantly surprised. It is simple to use, with complete instructions and recipes. And it makes wonderful ice cream in minutes. East clean up and storage.",positive
"Will never buy ice cream again!!  At first was hesitant bytthe few negative reviews.  Bought one two days ago and bought a load of milk and supplies cause figured it would take 5 or 6 times to get it right.  have made 4 ice creams already.  So far they have all turned out GREAT!  have always loved soft serve better.  used mostly the recipes that came with the machine except that being lactose intolerant, i used lactaid milk and also used baking splenda instead of sugar.  It worked out fine. But, i did make sure all the ingredients were real cold before i put them into the machine.  and also i put the 2 bowls into the chest freezer in plastic bags.  We are real happy with this for sure.",positive
"We were initially disappointed with this machine.  We tried recipes out of the booklet that came with it, the Ben & Jerry's book and another source.  The ice cream was just OK.  Something along the line of what we could pick up at the local convenience store.  Then we tried the recipe out of Christopher Kimball's The Desert Bible.  Hallelujah!  Creamy, rich, just what we had hoped for.We had a similar experience with our bread machine.  Mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook.  So, don't blame the machine too quickly.  The fault may lie in the recipe book.",positive
"We like ice cream. A lot.The Cuisinart Ice 20 Ice Cream Maker enables us to have ice cream with only a half hour's notice. Is this good or bad?Good, I say! Lick the beater, the cylinder and your bowl kind of good. All this in record time and without much effort on your part except for that tiresome spoon lifting.Make Ice Cream in the Privacy of Your Own HomeIce cream is not the difficult concoction it may seem. All you need are a few simple ingredients, depending on your taste, an ice cream maker, rock salt, ice ...Uh-uh! Not with this machine! The Cuisinart Ice-20 lets you toss the rock salt out on the slippery sidewalk where it belongs and requires no melting bags of ice to stuff in the freezer in advance.More ""No's"":* No more hand-cranking* No more frozen chunks of ice jamming the rotating freezer cylinder and stopping the machine mid-cycle* No more relegating the ice cream making to the basement, the garage or outside where dripping salt water can run will-nilly out a drain hole that's never in a convenient place* No more trips to the supermarket or to the ice cream shop down the street* No more, ""Sorry, we're out of that."" Make whatever you like!Am I Really a Good Spokesperson for This Ice Cream Maker?You betcha!We are high-end ice cream people. That does not mean we eat only Hagen Daas quality stuff (well ... we actually do), but that we could keep a small ice cream shop in business with just our family. Counting relatives, we could support a chain of such shops.We eat a lot of ice cream and we like a variety of flavors. The Ice-20 allows us to have the best of both worlds -- with a little time for preparation in between, of course.The PackageThe Cuisinart Ice-20 comes boxed with:* a cylindrical plastic churn* one freezer bowl (1-1/2 quart with liquid encased in it for purposes of freezing)* the motor housing* a clear plastic dome lid* a manual/recipe bookThere is also a reply card in the box with which to document your purchase. SEND THAT IN TOOT-SWEET! This little appliance comes with a 3-year manufacturer's warranty on defects. Not a shabby deal in the least.Each piece is wrapped carefully in plastic bags, which I suggest saving, too ... the larger ones, at least. Use these to wrap the freezer bowl while preparing it for use. More on that to come.So Now You've Unpacked It ...What to do with an ice cream maker you just unwrapped? One might like to rip right in to making ice cream, but that can't happen with this particular machine. It does not offer a compressor in order to chill the product as you go ... you have to provide the cold, and that means cleaning out a space in the freezer -- and make it a permanently-cleared space 'cause you'll need it. Trust me.You'll want to wash the freezer bowl, first.- in the sink ONLY -- no dishwasher- no abrasives/no cleansers- warm water and liquid soap with a soft cloth and a good rinse- dry thoroughlyOnce washed, wrap the bowl in plastic. This keeps that ""freezer taste"" from getting into your frozen product-to-be. Use that handy bag that came with the unit, or use a plastic grocery bag to enclose the bowl. Place it in the freezer and close the door. For extra-fast chilling, put a bag of frozen vegetables inside the bowl.My bowl freezes in my refrigerator freezer in 8 hours. It should be a solid freeze. No sloshing, or your ice cream won't ""ice"". I hear tell it can take much longer for some folks' bowls to freeze, but check your freezer setting ... it should be, according to Cuisinart, at 0?, but mine is at 25? and works quickly.Once your bowl is solidly frozen, make your ice cream base. There are a few recipes for ice cream, sorbet and frozen yogurt in the recipe book included with the Ice-20, or use one of your own, but be sure it is for 1-1/2 quarts or less.We make only full-fat, fully-flavored ice creams which I can recommend, but we do not partake of sorbets or frozen yogurt, yet I can't imagine the experience would differ. The methods remain similar, and if you have frozen the bowl you're more than half way there.Come Along with Me ... the Best Is Yet To BeFrom start to finish the Cuisinart Ice-20 is easy to use, easy to clean and a dream machine for those of us who enjoy a good bowl of ice cream often ... on occasion.Once you've frozen your bowl -- which you'll want to leave in the freezer until the last minute, simply follow your chosen recipe, remembering to leave any additives such as chocolate chips or chopped nuts out until the last 5 or 10 minutes of processing. No ""extra"" should be larger than a chocolate chip -- I'm guessing this is to protect the plastic churn.Once you have your concoction ready, retrieve your freezer bowl, place it on the motor housing, place the plastic churn inside the bowl and slip the dome lid over all, making sure to align the embossed dot with the marking on the front of the motor housing to ""lock"" it (not a fool-proof mechanism, as this opens easily with less than a twist). It's really that quick.Plug in the machine and press ""on"". The motor will rotate the freezer bowl and the dome lid will hold the churn in place. Pretty simple!Carefully pour in your ice cream base and leave the room for 20 minutes or so. I dare you to try.You won't be able to do it because you won't believe you're making ice cream right there in your own kitchen. And, you'll want to appoint yourself ""Chief Taste-Tester"", as you won't want any family, friends or acquaintances to suffer at all. How big of you. You're selfless, just as I am!The dome lid offers an opening in the center through which to add ingredients, and I use it to ""sample"". Just be careful you don't lose a spoon in there. That'll cause a few raised eyebrows and strange looks when you go to serve your decadent dessert.If, after 20 or 30 minutes your ice cream isn't as thick as you'd like it (it comes out soft-serve for me), press ""off"", remove the dome lid and clean off the churn with a spatula. Just pop the bowl back in the freezer, covered, for about an hour or less, depending. The ice cream will harden nicely in about this amount of time.This is license to continue tasting at intervals, of course.You may wish to transfer the ice cream to a freezer-safe container for longer term storage, if you expect the ice cream to last that long. That way, you can clean the bowl and return it to the freezer to be ready for another batch.Everyone Will Scream for Ice Cream!Are there any down-sides to this appliance? None that I've found yet. For the ease with which I can use this I can't complain about having to freeze the bowl, nor is it intolerable that soft-serve is my result. I LOVE soft-serve! Plus, the ice cream can be transformed rather quickly into something firmer.The machine doesn't turn off itself, which isn't a negative for me. I can keep it running as little or as long as I like, but 25 minutes has been the longest running time in my experience. After that, we're eating ice cream!As for noise, it's tolerable. I find the Ice-20 to be much quieter than a blender, and only slightly noisier than most dishwashers. I find it comforting to hear it humming along with it's little whirring sound, for that, my friends, is the sound of ice cream in the making.Added BenefitsUsing the Cuisinart Ice-20 affords you some portion control, as you can make smaller batches than 1-1/2 quarts. If you need more than that amount it's simple to prepare batches ahead of schedule and freeze them. It's also possible to order an extra freezer bowl, which I did. It's handy and I've already made use of the extra one several times.This machine offers cord storage underneath it, allowing for only as much cord as needed to reach an outlet. The cord is about 2-1/2 feet long which is plenty for counter top use. When finished, just wind the cord up completely and store the machine for later.Since the Ice-20 is about the size of a 2-1/2 quart slow cooker it isn't difficult to store. Mine lives on a shelf inside my basement door. It would fit inside a cupboard, too, if I had a place there. You could also keep it on the counter top ...And, again, it couldn't be easier to clean. All the components, aside from the freezer bowl, need only a wipe-down with a damp cloth. The freezer bowl in anodized aluminum on the inside and plastic on the outside, so warm water and dish soap do the trick easily.You Made This? Really?Having served vanilla, chocolate and mint chocolate chip ice cream at Daughter's birthday party recently, I have first-hand experience with the dropped-jaw look when people ask where you bought the ice cream.""I made it,"" you'll say. Cool, calm, collected and concise, too.They'll not believe it, I assure you. They'll want your secret, and it's up to you whether or not to tell them.Share the joy, won't you?",positive
"We use this machine quite a lot during the summer.  It is awesome for ice cream, sorbet and slushy mixed adult beverages....mmmmmm.....can't wait for summer again!",positive
"This is a delightfully easy way to make ice cream that tastes the way you want it to.  Want a flavor no one sells?  Mix it yourself with this easy-to-use machine.  Even basic flavors are great when you control the ingredients that go in.The machine is not messy, as it requires no ice or rock salt, and all of the parts are fairly easy to wash.  The recipes in the instruction book work just fine.A bit of advice;1)Read the instructions carefully.2)Plan for some lead time.  You need to have the bowl completely frozen. (If you need to make more than one batch at a time, you can buy an extra freezer bowl.)3)Bear in mind that the ice cream will still be soft when the machine is done with it. (This is true with most ice cream machines.) You will still need to put it in the freezer for a while before serving.4)Indulge in high quality ingredients; for example, get some whole vanilla beans for your vanilla ice cream. (If you want a lot of them, eBay is the cheapest place to get them.)I am delighted with this purchase and just can not imagine buying ice cream from the store again.",positive
"I bought this because my son was diagnosed with a dairy allergy.  I wanted to be able to provide ice cream without breaking the bank.  There are new coconut milk ice creams available but at $6 a pint I could pay for this unit in a hurry.  I buy my Thai brand Coconut Milk (not lite) from Walmart at $1.42 per can.  You just freeze the cylander, add 2 cans of coconut milk, a little sugar, vanilla and whatever else you want to flavor and let it go.  1/2 hour later I had what looked like soft serve ice cream.  My children were so thrilled!",positive
"I bought this ice cream maker for my roommate because we eat a lot of ice cream in the warmer months and he loves red kitchen accessories. Our first batch of ice cream didn't turn out so well.  It wasn't very thick, but we quickly discovered we had not left the tub in the freezer long enough before we started.Once we figured out you should really put the tub in the freezer overnight and make the ice cream the next day, and only let it run for about 20 minutes as suggested, you get perfect ice cream every time.  The small batch is plenty for 2 large servings or 4 small ones, so there's never any leftovers.  The tub cleans up very easily too.It's great for a simple vanilla mixture using milk, cream, and sugar every time, but we've crunched up M&M;'s for a batch which was wonderful.  During the holidays we added a touch of Baileys which was amazing. We did try a fresh squeezed orange sorbet as well but found it really needed a lot of sugar to cut the acidity.  I'd probably just try frozen juice concentrate next time.Be sure to keep the instruction book!  There are lots of ideas and recipes inside.  I'm looking forward to trying the fresh basil and lemon sorbet this summer. Overall, for the price you pay and the simplicity of the device, it was a smart investment for our kitchen. We generally spend about $10 in ice cream every other week during the summer, so this maker has already paid for itself!",positive
"If you think that you cannot make good ice cream without the rock salt and a ton of ice, well you should check out this Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker!  It is so easy and convenient to use, and in 20-25 minutes you have soft serve ice cream.  If you want to freeze it hard, just put it in the freezer for awhile if there is any left after you taste your results over and over again!  Also, if you make a lot of ice cream, be sure to pick up the extra freezer container.  Keep one in the freezer at all times and you are never caught without one that is ready to go!",positive
"My daughter-in-law wanted this for so long to make fresh sorbet, I bought it as a gift for her. She has already made watermelon sorbet and it came out great. If you buy this I recommend buying the extra canister so you can leave it in te freezer and always be ready.",positive
"I've only used this once so far, but it's pretty awesome.  You just pour in your pre-mixed, chilled ingredients, press start, and set a kitchen timer.  20-30 minutes later, the ice cream comes out like soft serve, which is great, but you can pour it into a freezer container and firm it up if you'd like, (which I did because it was for a birthday party later in the day).  My only complaint is that it's a little noisy.  I wouldn't recommend running it while you're trying to watch a movie or something.  I'm looking forward to using this more when the weather warms up here in Michigan.",positive
"This is very easy to use; it's just like another small appliance you can use on your counter top.  It does a good job, except that a hard frozen layer forms around the sides and needs to be scraped down about halfway through.I'm updating this since I've had it a few more months.  It still works great, and I've been able to experiment more.  Even if I don't get the recipie just right, it freezes just fine.  I use frozen berries to make sorbets with less sugar (high fructose corn syrup) than the grocery store kinds.  I've also made a batch of very rich vanilla (with eggs carefully cooked) and it came out wonderful.",positive
"I've had this machine for over a year, and I LOVE IT! It all started with looking for good low-carb ice cream and finding none that actually had flavor. We've made some great recipes with this. It's fast, easy to clean, and makes plenty for left-overs.",positive
"I put this ice cream maker on my Amazon.com wish list, and my sweet daughter sent it to me for my birthday. :)I just made my first batch of ice cream today. I'm very pleased with both the machine's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream. My youngest daughter tasted the ice cream and said it was ""awesome."" I agree.About the noise level: I'm rather sensitive to loud noise, but I don't think this machine is particularly noisy. It's not whisper quiet, but it's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender.",positive
"I bought this maker after reading reviews on forums. I use it to make non-dairy ice cream with Vances Dari-Free which is a powdered milk substitute made from potatoes. It works absolutely brilliantly and for the first time in a decade I actually had 'ice cream'. With Vances you must pre-make the ice cream mix in a pot and heat it. The mix must be allowed to cool in fridge for a few hours. Then simply place it in the Cuisinart and turn on. In a half hour you end up with a soft serve ice cream that tastes just like the real thing. The device is so easy to use and clean we've been using it every day! This is one of the greatest items I have purchased in a long time and I only regret that I waited so long to get one. Here's my recipe I developed:In a pot add:9 tablespoons of powdered Vances Darifree (or any powdered milk)3 tablespoons of tapioca starch flour6 tablespoons of sugar3 cups of waterTurn heat on medium and whisk constantly to combine the dry mix with water and to prevent sticking to the pot. The mix will begin to thicken after a few minutes.Now add:1/3 cup of any butter, margarine of choice+1 or 2 teaspoons of Vanilla or other extractContinue heating and whisking until the mixture is completely combined and thickened. I do this until it begins a low boil - bubbles and steam begin.Cool in fridge and follow ice cream maker instructions.* If you want to use soy milk, rice milk or other milk simply eliminate the powdered Vances and water and replace with any 3 cups liquid substitute.* If you want to make Carob or Chocolate ice cream add 1/4 cup powdered cocoa or roasted carob to the dry mix.",positive
"This is a very nice ice cream maker.  It is easy to use, easy to store and easy to clean.",positive
"This is my second summer using the Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1 1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, and it's never let me down.  Now I find that this machine is Jeni Britton Bauer's favorite.  As she explains inJeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home, when the ice cream is done, it will . . . still be soft, but the ice crystal structure is intact and stable.  Finish the freezing by . . . hardening it in the freezer.""  My only complaint is that this machine is a bit noisy, but it takes just 25 minutes or so to freeze a batch--not too long to vacate the kitchen.",positive
"I purchased this model about 3 years ago. I have never been disappointed with the results. It sure is a little inconvenient, as you will have to freeze the bowl beforehand, and the machine is quite loud.1) Do not expect it to taste like store bought Ice Cream.2) Do not expect it to cost less, I think store bought Ice Creams are cheaper.3) You can be imaginative and create your own flavor blends.Overall, very satisfied.",positive
"I love this machine.  A cousin had tried a couple of other brands including one about 4 times more expensive and had to return both of them, so I read the reviews very carefully.  This one is easy to use and it works.  I followed the instructions exactly. The ice cream is great.  I did freeze the ice cream for an additional 2 hours after it was mixed as the manual suggests.  Works perfectly. Yumm  It doesn't make a lot, just a little over two pints.",positive
"This machine is very easy to use.  It comes with a handy little recipe book to help you with your first few recipes.  One thing you must do is  freeze the bowl for a good 24 hours the first time, then you will want to  cover the bowl in plastic (to prevent freezer flavors tainting the bowl),  and leave it in your freezer.  You will be making home made ice cream in  about 20 minutes.  The consistancy is good, and it is delicous.  Best of  all, you will not be adding any strange presevatives, or anything you do  not want.  Ben and Jerry's has an excellent recipe book that you can get  here at amazon, and you will be making up tasty ice cream in no time!",positive
"I got one of these ice cream makers as a Christmas gift, and it's been fantastic. I was careful before requesting it to check the temperature of my freezer. If your freezer doesn't maintain a temperature of between 0-5 degrees Fahrenheit, your ice cream probably won't turn out that well. Mine stays at a chilly zero degrees, and I've been amazed at how quickly this machine makes great frozen desserts. I've made the full-fat ice creams, a couple of sherbets, and frozen yogurt -- everything froze quickly and evenly, and came out with fantastic texture and flavor. It's been a great gift. I keep the bowl in the freezer, wrapped in a plastic bag and filled with frozen vegetables, so it's always ready to go.",positive
"We have had this maker a few years now and its reliable, fast and easy to use.Clean up is very easy and I just bought a second bowl to keep in the freezer if we need more than one batch at a time.I have also used it to make frozen lemonade concentrate from myers lemons and it turned out awesome.Then had my own home made lemonade concentrate to make fresh lemonade in the summer.This machine is not loud, and is easy to use and makes delicious ice cream.",positive
"I bought this for my son for his birthday.  Wow, is it easy and delicious.  A person could be in real trouble with this ice cream maker sitting around.We first made the vanilla recipe and it was better than wonderful...just a few ingredients into the bowl and away you go.  Fat City is on the horizon.  I love it.  Thank goodness my son lives 1000 miles away or I would be in real trouble with this little machine.  The price is good and the ice cream is wonderful.  Wonderful gift.",positive
"I had soft serve ice cream in about 25 min's after following the easy instructions. There is some noise when the machine is preparing the mix, but not enough to drive you nuts.Overall I am very happy with the Cuisinart and would recomend it to friends.",positive
"The cheap plastic paddle broke on the first batch of strawberry ice cream.  I am now upgrading to a Lelo.If I had it all to do over again, I would never have bought this!",positive
"I finally pulled this out and used it after owning it for more than a year.  Everything went smooth and my sorbet is fine but....this machine is so loud that it is annoying.  To have to listen to this for 20-30 minutes is extremely difficult.  Having never used another ice cream maker, I don't know how it compares.",positive
"If you love Ice Cream, you will love this ice cream maker.  You can have fresh homemade ice cream in about 30 minutes from start to finish!  YUM!  It is great just for fun, it is great to use for entertaining, it is great for hot summer days.  I found that Sam's Club has Half and Half as well as fresh Whipping Cream for a great price, so it makes using this machine even more fun!",positive
"I just got this machine and made the strawberry ice cream recipe that came with it.  Ben and Jerry, eat your heart out.  This is so easy there's no reason to ever eat store bought ice cream again.  No locust bean gum, no artificial color, no preservatives - and you can make it with organic ingredients if you want.  The ice cream tastes awesome, and I would recommend this machine to anyone, especially those who cannot use a hand crank machine, or don't want the fuss and muss of using salt.",positive
"I read many of the reviews before buying this ice cream maker, and the reviewers were right!  It's a great little machine...I don't think it's that noisy (no more so than a food processor).  I love it - I do agree that the recipes that come with it are not great, but there are lots of wonderful recipes out there.  This is fast, easy, and no worries about salt and ice running all over make it much more likely I will continue to use it quite often!",positive
This was the easiest ice cream I've ever made. My niece and nephews loved it. They enjoyed being able to see it iwhile the ice cream was making.,positive
"My machine didn't work the first two attempts.  The liquid never turned to ice cream.  I tried two different recipes - I was very disappointed. Since my first two attempts bombed,I went online and read as much as I could to figure out why I couldn't make ice cream and 900 other people could with this machine.  Here's what I found out.  1st)Freezer temp is extremely important (get a thermometer and lower freezer temp till it reads 0 degrees) - mine had been set at the factory recommended setting of middle range, so I turned it down to the lowest setting. 2)Container needs to be really frozen - don't put in a cramped freezer, allow space around container so it freezes throughly all around container. I had it in freezer three days this time 3)Recipe needs to be cooled as well!  With my first attempts, the ingredients were at room temperature and then in the frig an hour or so - on my third try I put recipe in frig for three nights in the back of frig where it is the coldest.Voila!!!!! Trying out this new information produced the coveted creamy frozen ice cream I had read others were making!!!!!  I give this machine 4 stars because the company didn't offer thorough instructions in their booklet (I was close to throwing the machine out into the trash), and the preparations took me several days to get the right temperatures in the container and the recipe.  I am on a roll now though and look forward to making many more favors.",positive
"I love homemade ice cream, but have not had luck with the traditional ice cream freezers where you add ice and rock salt.  Though less expensive, they are less consistant.The Cuisinart ice cream maker is the opposite.  This handy contraption soft freezes your ingredients in a mere 20 - 30 minutes and is simple to use.  Simply freeze the canister ahead of time, add frozen canister to top of plastic base, add ingredients and turn on!Consistant results every time.  The recipe book included with the machine is very good, and all of the recipes are easy to follow and are delicious. Some recipes are no cook Philadelphia Style (only cream, sugar and flavorings) though most are custard style (involving cooking the ingredients and adding eggs).  All are easy to make even by the kitchen novice.Once you learn the basics of making ice cream, you will not want to buy store bought again.I use this machine about once a week to make ice creams, sherberts, and water ices.  Its definately a must for those who like fresh homemade desserts.",positive
"I have always used my kitchen aid attachment for ice cream and am very happy with it; however, we don't eat a lot of ice cream and the Kitchen Aid bowl was too big.  I picked this up when I read some great reviews and I am very pleased.  The ice cream maker is very easy to use and while not as quiet as I hoped for, it doesn't take long to get great ice cream.  Note that what you first end up with is more soft serve which we really enjoy but after a few hours in the freezer you have more of an ice cream texture.  Great product - Cuisinart never lets me down!",positive
"Upfront:  Yes, I recommend this machine.  It's easier to use than any other ice cream maker I've ever owned.  However, there are a couple of things to remember or you're going to be very frustrated by the experience.  First off, the freezer bowl has to be frozen solid.  Near solid isn't good enough.  I suggest you leave the bowl in your freezer for two days just to make sure it's cold enough.  Be sure your ingredients are very cold, too.  I use condensed and/or evaporated milk in a couple of my recipes and a day or two in the refrigerator is really important.  Room temperature just won't cut it.  And the thicker the better with this machine.  A custard base is an excellent way to start.Next, don't dawdle.  Get your ingredients right into the bowl.  It begins to thaw pretty quickly, especially in hot weather.  And that's when ice cream is best, isn't it?  And finally, twenty-five minutes to half an hour is about as long as the freezer bowl lasts, so if you've gone that long and it's still looking like soft-serve, get it right into a container and toss it in the freezer for a while before serving.I know it sounds complicated, but it's not really.  Most of it is just remembering to get things to the right temperature.  This isn't a big, fancy freezing unit, it's a relatively inexpensive way to make your own ice cream at home.  You're going to have to make some adjustments.  That said, I have to tell you that it's a great deal of fun to watch the ice cream freezing and to turn it out into bowls and see the eyes of your family light up when you say, &quot;The ice cream is ready!&quot;I put this item in the fun to have but not a necessity category.",positive
This is fun with the kid but a bit messy. Also freezing the coolant takes forever. Fun Though,positive
"I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THIS CUISINART ICE-20 ICE CREAM, YORGURT, SORBET, MAKER. IT'SMADE EXCELLENT COCONUT ICE CREAM, AND RASBERRY SORBET. IT'S VERY SIMPLE DIRECTIONS,QUICK, AND WHAT I FOUND ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT YOU DON'T NEED TO USE SALT, ICE,AND ANY UNHEALTHY INGREDIENTS TO MAKE A GREAT SUMMER/WINTER TREAT. CUISINART,PUTS OUT A GREAT PRODUCT, AND THE SELLER WAS VERY REASONABLE ON HIS PRICE. ITHANK YOU SINCERELY. DH",positive
"One of my favorite kitchen appliances.  This item arrived on time and is an excellent purchase.  I like it very much and am VERY glad I ordered it.  Thank you so much Amazon.com for the great price, good value and prompt delivery.  I use this item frequently.",positive
"I've just gotten this machine and have made the basic vanilla ice cream twice. Both times were a total sucess!  The ice cream is delicious!  No more ice and salt mess! Preparation time is quick and easy! The machine is a little noisy, however, no big deal. It was facinating watching it thicken up for the final result. Time in the freezer is usually needed after it's done.  That's the hardest part....the waiting!  Clean up time is quick as well! Looking forward to trying the other recipes in the booklet, I'm sure they'll be just as tasty.  I highly recommend this machine!!  I know that we'll be having home made ice cream a lot more often now!",positive
"I purchased the CIM-22PC (a similar model) from Costco.  Be aware that key plastic parts (the lid and mixing arm) are not dishwasher safe.  In our case, they warped in the dishwasher and rendered the entire machine unusable.  Cuisinart should have used dishwasher-safe plastic.",positive
Works great; there's nothing like home made ice cream and to have it within minutes with so little effort is a miracle.  For years I used one of the old ice and salt makers that does a great job but you hardly use if because of the mess and effort needed.  If you store the tub in the freezer you can almost decide to have ice cream and satisfy that desire immediately.,positive
"I bought this unit in hopes it would fill in a gap in our 'desert self-sufficiency', that is our ability to make rather than buy whatever we were craving and avoid having to hump into town for supplies.This gem of a unit has the frozen desert category covered.It IS bigger than it looked - but only about the size of standard Cuisinart food processer as far as footprint.  We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle.  Note on the bowl:  its possible to make two batches before refreezing, just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise, but for us its not too much.  Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy (mostly dishwasher) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit.  Sweet.",positive
"When buying the Cuisinart ice cream maker, I really wasn't sure I'd use it, as I rarely eat ice creams.  The power to create is a heady experience, though, and the effortlessness with which wonderful concoctions can be made using this machine ensures it will not become one of those useless appliances collecting dust on a shelf somewhere.This is a great purchase even for those who assume they can't eat ice cream!  Since you control the ingredients, you can create recipes working around any sort of diet -- allergy, diabetic, lactose intolerant, vegan, whatever!  The machine also works equally well for sherberts and frozen drinks.  It's extremely easy to use and cleans very easily.Few notes for better results:1) The bowl must be *frozen*. I recommend at least 2 days in the freezer between uses (you may want a second bowl).2) Upon removing the bowl from the freezer, add ingredients and use -- it will start to thaw immediately.  A friend noted that covering the top of the unit while mixing causes it to retain its &quot;cool&quot; longer (a plate over the opening works well).3) The ingredients must be very cold.  If cooking ingredients (such as for fruit or egg enhanced recipes), it's absolutely necessary to chill the resulting mixture before adding it to the unit.4) Choice in ingredients can make or break your ice cream.  While milk can be used, cream results in a much richer, thicker, tastier ice cream.  Also, make sure you've crushed or finely chopped any solid ingredients before adding, as otherwise, they will clog in the mechanism; they should also be added during the last 5 minutes only or will impede freezing (same goes for alcohol).  Thorough mixing of ingredients is important, as well, since the machine does not churn the mixture (sugar especially needs to be well dissolved or will result in uneven flavoring).5) Regardless of what you do, you will produce very soft ice cream.  Pouring the result into a freezer-proof container and freezing for a few hours to one day works very well.I know that sounds like a lot of hassles, but it's really not.The preparation of ingredients can range from moments to hours, as your options are quite limitless.It makes 1.5 quarts of ice cream, which is not a limitation (should you feel you will consistently need more servings, invest in additional bowls). It stores very well, lasting for a couple of weeks without crystalizing.  I would use mine every day if I could remember to buy cream!",positive
I purchased this ice cream maker after reading all of the reviews. Since I own a chest freezer I use it to store the bowl and have avoided the problem some mentioned concerning the ice cream not freezing well. I must say I love this appliance! It works exactly as advertised and I have been enjoying some of the best ice cream in my life. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to purchase an ice cream maker.,positive
"I connected some quick disconnect fittings to this Y fitting. Two of the openings in this Y were the right size, but one opening was too large. I had to cut slots in the rim of the opening and use a hose clamp to bring the size down to the correct diameter. I verified the opening diameter with several other fittings and calipers to see that the one opening was indeed bigger than the normal size.This item will normally work great if you are connecting hose directly to it, but use caution when connecting other items to it.Plastic will change shape after it has been injected and cools (like this product). Good engineering and good chemical composition will compensate for those changes. I recommend getting a different brand product instead of this one if you want quality and consistency.",positive
item arrived quickly and was as described. I would order from them again with confidence in their promise. Package was intact.,positive
"The 4&#34; flex tubing fit perfectly over this fitting for my woodshop dust system. I'd give it 5 stars, but I had to remove with a Dremel some casting slag from the interior. No big deal; nice fitting.",positive
I use these in my overhead flexible four inch system for dust control. The system is attached to an Oneida 1&1/2 hp  system which pretty much covers my small shop,positive
This works with a flex hose but is not the same 4 inch size of your standard four inch pipe. It's smaller. Had to duck tape it more than I should have had to.,positive
"The marking holes and slots on this protractor are great.  I have used protractors before but had to always eyeball the markings with various degrees of accuracy.  This protractor takes away that error.  A bonus is that a .5mm mechanical pencil came in the package too.  It is just the right diameter to fit in all of the holes and slots.The T-bar is a good feature also.  You can loosen the thumb screws to slide the T-bar off of the protractor.  Be careful to not loosen the thumb screw all of the way since they are tightened by two nuts in the T-bar channel which will come off of the threads if the thumb screws are loosened too much.  Once the T-bar is removed you can then remove the nuts from the thumb screws so the thumb screws can be removed from the protractor in order to lay the protractor flat.  To re-attach the T-bar to the protractor insert the threaded shaft on the thumb screws in the large holes on the protractor, thread the nuts on enough to secure them, the slide the nuts into the T-bar channel and tighten down the thumb screw.  There is an indexing  lip on one side of the T-bar that the base of the protractor rests up against to ensure accuracy.The T-bar is 7 in. (178 mm) long by 11/16 in. (17 mm) wide by 7/16 in. (11mm) thick.",positive
"Its Incra, its accurate, it is well made. You need your trifocals for the angle indexes and a sharp pencil , but it is dead on.",positive
"I have used the T-rule so much, I decided to get this as well.  These rules are very accurate, and easy to use.  Use a 5mm lead mechanical pencil, and store the rule carefully.  They are made of thin aluminum.",positive
It's Incra.  It's excellent as usual.  Well worth the investment.  Do buy another mechanical pencil to supplement the one/ones Incra provides.  They aren't great and you won't be happy when you can't get it unjammed while in the middle of a project.  A .5mm pencil will work but a .3mm engineering pencil is perfect.,positive
"My husband is very hard to buy for. The previous two years, he opened his gifts then set them aside. One he loaned to a friend! This and the other Incra item I purchased for him...he was very impressed.",positive
The whole line of Incra products are fantastic and the marking protractor is no exception.  The build quality is fantastic.  I like how the aluminum edge stop at the bottom is easily removable with two thumb screws.  It has many different indexed cutouts for precise marking.,positive
"Great timer, quality seems to be much better than the other brands I bought over the past few years. Right now I am using the timer to turn on and off Christmas lights and it seems to be pretty dependable. Probably will purchase more of these timers in the future.",positive
This item works as expected and shows no signs of problems controlling audio/video gear. I am happy with it as I always am.,positive
I have several of these timers.  I use one on my cat's drinking fountain.  I use the others on lights in the house.  It is best for when I am gone on a trip.,positive
We bought this AC timer to use in conjuction with a heated pet bed for a crate on our back porch.  It worked all last winter and it is still working.  No problems.  Easy to set and forget.  Highly recommend.,positive
"I use the TN311C heavy-duty grounded timer to control the ON-OFF cycle of a dehumidifier.  I actually bought two units - the 2nd one as a back-up - and, removed all of the ""ON"" and ""OFF"" trippers from the back-up unit to use on this one.  This gives me 6 ON-OFF cycles, and it works perfectly with our dehumidifier.  I've set the timer to turn ON the dehumidifier for 2 hours and then OFF for 2 hours throughout the day and night.  It keeps our area perfectly dehumidified, and the humidity rise is only 4% to 5% during the OFF cycle.I would recommend this timer to anyone considering a use similar to mine.",positive
"I have used a number of these for years with no problems whatsoever.  However I realized that the timers use more power than some of my lights!  I have a 4 Watt night light which we run all night in the hallway and the timer draws 5 Watts - 24x7.  That was bad enough, but then I replaced the 4 Watt night light with an LED bulb that draws 1/2 watt or so.  It was way cheaper to run that 24x7 then to use a timer to ""save money"" and have it only on at night.  I have thrown these all away and purchased digital timers - they pay for themselves in energy savings.",positive
"I had used this and it works very well, but seems to lose some time over the weeks that I have to reset the hours up.  Not a big deal but works really well.",positive
I use the timer to turn lamps on in the house so that when we come home there is light in the house. It does a good job.,positive
After just over a week my unit began to make a clicking noise like a moving part was hitting something.  The back on all these also gets quite hot.,positive
"I own several of these and appreciate the fact that it is 3-prong rather than 2-prong. I've yet to find a timer with such simplicity and easy adjustment. Never had one fail on me even when running at rated capacity. At this price, it can't be beat.",positive
Have used this for several years now for the Christmas decor.  Has worked perfectly without any problem.  Would buy again without hesitation.,positive
Aquarium light go on and off each day.  Works for me !,positive
With a 600 watt load far below it rating the timer grinds and gets hot .It also slows down and becomes unreliable .I do not recommend this product,positive
"It does it's job very well.It is connected to my wall a/c and to my attic fans.It runs well, no problems, i like it.",positive
"I'd had these timers for years and had no problems, so the issue is not with the timer itself. BUT now that I have a TODDLER, these really can't be used anymore, since she finds it fun to pull out the little plastic pieces that are needed to set the timer. Not only is this a choking hazard (however minor), but once the pieces are gone, the timer is useless! CAUTION WITH DIGITAL TIMERS, TOO, THOUGH (though I'll have to try them again): We had a power surge, and all of the timers got ruined (and we tried to change the batteries - no help)! SO, OVERALL A GOOD PRODUCT AND MORE RELIABLE THAN DIGITAL TIMERS, but NOT good if you have toddlers!",positive
"While I can't vouch for the build quality of this timer (it feels cheaply made and I'm not sure how long it will last), it works well, is easy and simple to use, and is silent. Being silent is important to me because it's annoying to hear buzzing especially if you are using it in a quiet room.In my case, I use it on my refrigerator so that I don't hear the fridge on when I'm watching a movie on my HDTV in the living room (which is in close proximity to the kitchen).I don't use any red 'off' pins on the timer and just use the manual switch to turn off the fridge before I start watching a movie. Then I turn the dial so that the green pin is about 2 hours away, which nicely turns the refrigerator back on two hours later.This setup works very well for me and my food doesn't suffer any. Before I got this timer, I used to turn off the circuit breaker for the refrigerator but I would forget to turn it back on! Needless to say, this timer has been a life saver in that my fridge comes back on and my food doesn't spoil like it did when I forgot to turn it on manually.The fact that this timer has a 3 prong plug is also a plus because many of the non 'heavy duty' timers only have a 2 prong plug.",positive
One Of The Best Fans I Have Ever Bought & I Love The Noise it makes Great for those that have to Sleep in the day & Work at Night!!!,positive
"This is a nice window fan with good power and not too noisy, adaptable to different window sizes if you need to move it. However, the sliding panels are flimsy and don't move smoothly; the fasteners that are used to clamp the panels in place are cheap and can easily be unscrewed and fall out.  The single knob control works fine but the settings are hard to see; you will end up turning it by click or fan noise to the desired power or direction. Well-packaged in the box.",positive
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS FAN ...IT IS THE BEST ...ONLY THING IS THAT YOU MUST VENTILATE TO GET ITS FULL POWER...OPEN ANOTHER WINDOW SLIGHTLY TO BRING ALL THE GREAT AIR IN ...ITS WELL WORTH THE MONEY,positive
"I have never spent more than maybe $10 on a fan in my life, so I was kinda antsy about buying this one, but seriously, it was absolutely worth the price for me.Let me explain my situation: My building is really old, retains a LOT of heat, and the wiring is such that tenants are only allowed to have one small window AC unit per apartment. Moving it back and forth from one side to the other is a huge pain, but it results in a sort of less-dramatic Sophie's Choice: do we leave the AC in the bedroom so we can actually sleep, or leave it in the living room/kitchen so that we can actually get things done without dying of heatstroke? So that's why I bought this fan--to help move air in the kitchen/living area and hopefully make both rooms habitable during the heat. I haven't gotten the chance to test it during a major heat wave yet (hopefully I won't NEED to *crosses fingers*) but so far, I could not be more pleased with how well it works.What I love the most about it is the versatility. It is nearly silent on the ""low"" settings, but when you set it on ""high,"" it moves a LOT of air. The fact that you can flip back and forth between intake and exhaust is really one of the selling points--it's super-handy in our combined kitchen/living room because, when my partner is cooking, we can flip it on to draw out a lot of the heat it produces. If we open up all the rooms, it helps a lot with cross-ventilation--way more than the box fan we were using previously. In addition, our old building has huge radiators which produce a TON of heat in the winter, and the exhaust function, when placed in a window near the radiator, helps a lot with keeping it from becoming too hot in here. Bonus! Basically, it does everything I hoped it would do, and a couple of things I didn't even anticipate.I also love the way it's shaped--it fits nicely in the windowframe, and has a cute retro appeal. It's front-heavy, but still quite easy to move. It's also easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning, which is a HUGE plus.My only complaints, all of which are extremely minor:-I wish it were a little flatter, just because now we can't really close the indoor shutters on that window, but that's an unusual situation (most people probably don't have those!) and I won't fault the design for it.-I'm a little concerned about the switch--it seems a bit flimsy and I'm afraid it'll break if I turn it with too much enthusiasm. But, so far, so good!-while it's pretty quiet, it does make a distinctive noise on the exhaust setting. It's a bit annoying, but if you're more than a few feet away, you can't really hear it--I've used it while napping on the couch before and not found it distracting.",positive
"This thing moves some serious air.  It does have a few issues, but I can put up with them for how well it works.  It seems a bit flimsy, but once mounted it is relatively solid.  It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side.  The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws, so it is removable.  The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it.  If it bothers you, put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on.  It is electrically reversable, but it exhausts air much better than it draws air, and mounting it backwards would make it so you could not close the window.  The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed. The noise goes away on high speed, which is how we run it anyway.",positive
"I was looking for a fan that would really draw fresh air into my apartment (5 rooms, total ~1000sq ft).  It's very frustrating to me when it's nice and cool outside on a summer evening, but still sticky and stuffy inside from the heat of the day.  I've tried two of the little twin window fans, a larger oscillating fan on a stand, and small round fans in windows, but even all these of those in combination never really seemed to make a big difference in a reasonable amount of time.  I've been in houses with attic-mounted whole-house fans, and it's amazing how quickly they'll exchange the air in a whole house!  That's the effect I was hoping for.In short, this Lasko 2155a has met my expectations.  If I turn it on high exhaust, open a couple windows on the opposite end of the apartment, and close the rest, it does a great job of pulling in fresh (cool!) air.  Of course it's not as fast or as powerful as a real attic whole-house fan, but especially given the price, convenience, and simple installation, it's a pretty good substitute.  It shouldn't even be in the same category as the little twin window fans - those are good for a single room, but they don't hold a candle to this Lasko.  When this is running on high exhaust, and with only a few other windows open, there's a noticeable breeze coming in those windows.  I notice a distinct change in the coolness and ""freshness"" of the inside air after only a few minutes.  It is pretty loud when it's on high, but it's not the obtrusive roar that I've seen described in other reviews.  I wouldn't want to sit right next to it and have a conversation or listen to music, but if you're in the next room, it's really not distractingly loud.  Also, I find it's helpful to leave this on high for a few (10-15?) minutes, and then turning it to low does a fine job of maintaining the fresh air inside.  When it's on low, the noise isn't bad at all - it's quieter than the oscillating stand fan I'd use otherwise.  Not distracting or bothersome, even if you're in the same room.So if you live in a small house or apartment, and you're looking for a reasonably-priced alternative to a full attic fan, I highly recommend this one!",positive
"I am using this as a whole house attic fan and it works just fine.  There is little noise and the hot air exhausted into the attic then escapes through the roof vents leaving both attic and house nice cooled.  From 106 degree daytime temperature, the fan will decrease the temperature to exactly the outside overnight temperature.",positive
"Absolutely fabulous.  Does exactly what it's supposed to, extremely well.  To install, you simply position screws into each side of your window frames- The fan's plastic privacy side panel extensions have little notched-out grooves on the edges, that slide right into the screws. Done!This fan gusts air like a tornado!  It's a completely different class of product, vs. those little toy-like ""twin window fans"" made by everyone, and sold everywhere, that barely move any air.My house is a 900 sq. ft. brick ranch, 1950's built with original windows (wooden sash/panels), and no central A/C.  This is truly a whole-house fan for me!  Completely turns over the entire house air in a matter of seconds. The direction of air flow (intake/exhaust) changes with a simple manual turn-knob.  There is a BIG difference between low/medium/high settings, which enables you to customize air flow to your liking.  Since the knob is manually operated, there are no complex, computerized electronics to malfunction.  While I'm readily technically competent, I HATE it when simple things are un-necessarily complicated, & therefore prone to electro/digital malfunction.  This is a purely simple, incredibly well designed, powerful window fan.Space usage / appearance:  It lies flat, on the back side / up against your window (this design is what allows you to slide the window closed- & locked- behind it).  In the front, the grill (& center control knob) extends out into the room about 7"".  The side panels offer great privacy.  The entire unit is off-white / cream-colored / neutral.  It looks retro-designer/ mid-century, a bit industrial-looking maybe.  I've searched for 17 years, & this is by FAR the best fan I've ever found.  Worth every penny & more.  If you're on the fence, buy it!  No doubt you'll find a use for it!  PS- I believe it's generally recognized that this is the same exact item/product as the Air King brand 16"" Window Fan, which is priced much higher.  Get this Lasko while you can!",positive
"I put this in a upstairs room to circulate the air up there. Works pretty good, It has a clicking sound when you first turn it on, but no big deal. Not real loud on med and slow speed but on high a bit loud. I really like being able to  shut the window when the weather gets bad. Wish it had a little more power on high but for the price you cannot beat it.",positive
"I have a Lasko fan that I bought around 1989 which still runs and I live in an apartment on the second floor that gets very hot in the summer so I decided to get another fan to have cross ventilation. I am really pleased with my purchase, this fan is lighter and easier to place in the window and you don't need to screw it in the window for it to stay in. It is much quieter than the older fan even on high speed and doesn't shake in the window like the older model does.I like the fan so much that I plan on purchasing another one next month and give the older model to a friend.",positive
We raise & show rabbits so we bought this fan for our rabbit barn because the ammonia smell was getting really bad in there & we needed something to pull that smell out. The barn isn't real big so there's wasn't enough air flow in there with only 1 window & 1 door so... needless to say we are VERY pleased with this exhaust fan!!! We keep the fan on exhuast 24/7 & you would never know that rabbits lived in there! It gets the smell out seconds after turning it on. I love that you can put it in the window & still be able to close the window behind it during bad weather. I was surprised at how inexpensive this fan was too! Definitely worth buying! & If something were to happen to the one we have we will definitely be buying another one!,positive
"I've had this exact model for about two years. My wife and I are both smokers.  This fan is very good at exhausting inside smoke to the outside.  Also when something starts smoking on the stove and fills the house with smoke, this fan will clear the whole house in less than a minute.  Electric reversing makes three speeds available for either exhausing or bringing fresh air in directly with just the twist of a knob. At medium and high speeds it helps to crack a window on the other side of the house.  Think of it as an 'attic fan' in your window.  Our window are 5' in height and this sits in the bottom 2' and since the window sill is only 8"" off the floor, the fan does not block the view at all except for the dogs.Two things: 1. Closely follow instructions when installing to avoid a noisy fan. Not properly mounted will result in vibration and more noise than necessary. (Also make sure base of fan is firmly sitting on the window sill when mounted...this will almost ensure vibration is minimal) 2. Fan needs to be cleaned at least annually (especially if you smoke).  You can remove 6 screws from inside the house which allows you access to clean the blades and the outside grill.Remember this fan is all plastic construction, fairly sturdy, but be careful not to strip screws by tightening too much.Finally, we've found that we are able to get a lot further into the summer season before we close up the house and turn on the central air because of this fan.",positive
"I searched for an exhaust fan for our new, hot garage.  I did not believe some of the negative reviews and neither should you!  This fan fit right into our garage window and has been working every day for months!  Who cares if it is not made out of a heavy metal; you don't have to touch it except to turn it off and on.  It pulls and exhausts a lot of air and that is what it is supposed to do.  Don't make life more complicated then it has to be.  With all my searching, Amazon gave me the best deal and with my rewards from my Amazon credit card the fan cost me $54.  What's not to like when other stores wanted as much as $110?",positive
"I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years. After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one. It does not fit properly in my kitchen window, but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window. The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much. I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised. The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air. The fact that is reversible is very useful. Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house.",positive
"This is my second one of these fans the first one lasted 5 years then just died.  As window fans go this is one of the better plastic ones. It disassembles easily to clean. The design is a bit flawed, you have to tape over holes and cracks with white tape to get maximum suction and block air from coming back in. The right sized blinds will close nicely on top and block the crack if you mount it for the window to close and open.",positive
"Only slightly better airflow than a box fan for 4x more money! Some nice features like the reverse function to use as an exhaust fan, but definitely not worth the money. In reading other reviews a number of people have mentioned this as a &#34;whole house&#34; fan. They must live in a trailer because this doesn't even circulate enough air to make much of a difference in my 400sqft living room.",positive
"I'm a smoker in a small 1100 square foot house and was tired of the lingering smoke, yellowed papers, drapes, etc. I live in Florida and the humidity is killer so it's not real productive to open windows to vent. I ordered 2 of these 16"" fans and boy are they big! They work incredibly well. I use one as an intake (High pressure area) and the other as an exhaust (Low pressure area). I can also turn both fans to exhaust and my whole house is clear as a bell, smells fresh, not a wisp of smoke anywhere, in only 2 minutes. 2 minutes! I had spent almost $1,000 for 2 Ionic Breeze Quadras and they couldn't do in hours what these 2 fans did for $130 in 2 minutes! These fans are a godsend! I actually could have easily gotten by with 2 of the 9"" fans instead. I'll probably order 2 of them to use for the winter/spring months then have these 16"" bad boys for the summer/fall months. I can imagine these fans would be heavenly for people with pets, cigar smokers, for cooking strong smelling foods like fish, etc. As you can see I am pleasantly surprised and very happy on my purchases. Also love the fact that the fans are both intake/exhaust. Great product, thank you.",positive
"It works well as a window fan to pull outside air in, takes only a few minutes to cool a room and about 1/2 hour to cool several rooms.  It's not quite what I expected as an exhaust fan and did little to cool the room running for more than an hour w/a second window open in the same room.  So if you've got a window w/o a screen and there are a lot of bugs outside, exhaust would be ideal... but it doesn't work very well.  Recommend industrial ceiling mounted whole house fan if you prefer heat exhaust instead of blowing air in.  Turning on additional box fans at oposite ends of the house seemed to help move air exponentially faster with multiple windows open.  All-in-all, if your window is big enough or you have the means to gerry-rig a $20 box fan, that may be the way to go.  If you prefer something that looks nice, can stay in place even when the window is closed, this might be worth $70 to you... I kinda prefer taking the extra 2 minutes to put a box fan in the window and put it away when I'm done.",positive
This fan is a good fan but does not move the amount of air I want to move.  I usually put a fan at one end of the house then open my bedroom window and have the fan pull in cool air at night.  this somewhat does the  job but really not enough.  I might be asking for too much for its size etc.  I like the fact that it is reversable and it is adjustable to fit wide or narrow windows.  If you are using it for one room this is a good fan but not great for the whole house (I have a small house 1500 sq ft).  I'd give it a try and see if it works for you.,positive
"I live in LA and summer can get to the low 100s. In the evenings though the temperature can dip into the 60s.  So I though of venting out the heat and drawing in the cool air, at night and early morning. I installed this in one of the casement windows in my house.  The way I installed it allowed for the window to be closed without taking down this fan.  So at night, I turn this on and vent out the hot indoor air, and it creates a negative pressure in the house so it sucks air through my front door and windows of the other bedrooms. It does create a cool breeze as it is drawing in the cooler fresh air.  I have not turned on my Air Conditioner since I installed this.During the day, I turn this off and shut the window and leave a small crack just to have some air.  The indoor temperature does increase by about 5 degrees by dusk.  When the Outdoor temperature goes below the indoor temperature, I open all the windows and doors and turn on this exhaust fan.  This system works very well for us and I am very happy with this purchase since I am saving so much money.  This paid for itself after only 2 weeks. You have to love that.",positive
"The first fan I purchased like this was in 1992 from Sears. It had their name on it, but it was obviously built by Lasko. That original is still functional, but after 14 years, it was time for a new one. Must be a proven, solid design to have been in production this long. It moves the air through my home easily, but my house is smallish, only about 1500 square ft. My only gripe concerns the fan guard, or grill, which faces towards the outside, through the open window. This grill is plastic, which we all know doesn't last forever. Exposed to direct sunlight and the elements, this grill will eventually become brittle. It takes several years for that to happen, but that's what happened with the first fan.I hope that Lasko will in the future consider making this grill out of metal, like the one facing the inside.One last thing........if, like me, you're sick of seeing ""Made in China"" stamped on everything, this fan is American-made.",positive
"These are great fans--I bought one for the upstairs hall, and one for the downstairs dining room of my colonial home.  WIth both of them running on exhaust, the whole house is cooled off within an hour on a cool summer night.  There is a bit of understanding needed with the dimensions though.  I had no choice but to mount the fan on  the inner window frame for both windows, because the extensions do not reach far enough to mount on the outside of the window frame.  The windows cannot be shut with the fan mounted, because they have a ""lip"" at the bottom, that overhangs a bit and runs the length of the window, to make opening and closing easier.  The lip interferes with the window closing while the fan is in place, so the fan must be removed from the mount if heavy rain is expected (Hurricane Irene, for instance!)  Even so, the fan is easily removed, once the screws are in place.",positive
"We've used this for a week now.Installation: it is easy, but may require some work to install, depending on your window frame. I had to pre-drill for the screws.Pros: -not too loud, even on high (but then I grew up with a large metal box fan in my window)-Easy to change speed and direction-nice size, larger then typical 2 blade fan, just smaller or equal to box fan-appears to be well built.-should be easy to clean. The blade cover is held on with a couple of screws and it looks easy to remove and get to the blade.-privacy, the side panels not only hold the fan in well, but also create some privacy there.-close windows and leave fan in place; removal is easy any wayCons: - size, it is a good size but the way it juts into the room it could be intrusive in small spaces, no problems for me though-some rattle at low speed, bought 3 fans and one rattles so much on low that I keep it on medium. Other two barely rattle, it appears to occur where the blade is connected to the motor.-price, but the usability and sound construction indicate it will be worth the priceI bought these to replace several dual blade fans that died simultaneously. I really like these and would recommend them, but with the understanding that you will have permanent screws in the window sills year round.",positive
"SO ITS DIFFICULT TO RATE.  AS I AM IN AN APARTMENT,FORCED TO INSTALL WINDOW FAN WITH WINDOW SCREEN STILL IN WINDOW---WHICH DECREASES FAN PERFORMANCE. STILL, ITS BEST FAN IVE OWNED. HIGH-LOW SPEED  DIAL DOESNT TURN EASILY",positive
"Probably the best available today, but, certainly not like the old metal ones. It fits where and how I want it to go and will do the job.It's got some sharp plastic edges on the inside. Sliced a finger reaching in to slide the side panels to fit.Low and medium speeds don't move much air and the small motor whines a bit on high. Fortunately I don't have to be in the room with it when it's on high.It does a much better job than the Holmes dual window fan I was using but I do long for the old metal King Air 20"" I had years ago. That was a window fan.",positive
"This is not able to go in front of my window, as the window I use it in is a double. However, I popped the screen out, and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside, and stand in front of it, you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another, but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened, and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times, and I'm glad it's there, but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan.",positive
"We needed to move the air in our whole house.  This fan wasn't up to the task.  We got a bigger fan by a Air King, and that got the air going.This fan is fine if you want to create a breeze or move the stale air out a large room.  Quiet operation is a big plus compared to the Air King.  So I'd recommend it for many purposes, but it wasn't what we needed.",positive
"There are too many reviews already to fret over one detail or another, so here's my brief take: my fan is well balanced, no perceptible wobbling or shaking at any speed.  The blades spin freely suggesting little bearing drag to strain the motor.  I found that it easily fits several of my windows without actually mounting it (i.e., installing the four screws that come with it).  That's a plus for me because I may want to use it in different rooms at different times - I can just set it in a window when needed, then remove it when I want it elsewhere or not at all.  My wattage meter says it uses about 63W on low and 78W on medium (very quiet at both low and medium speeds) and about 110W on high (noticeably louder than low/medium but not at all intrusive or annoying in my view).  If my house were bigger I'd buy another.  Good stuff.",positive
"This is my third fan in over thirty years, only because I've burned the motor out on the first two running them almost continuously every day.  Yes! I'm headed in the same direction. It works wonderfully either on exhaust or intake. I am just as satisfied with this one.",positive
"Stuck with an HOA that won't allow air conditioning and a high ceiling that traps heat during the afternoon I ordered this whole house fan with trepidation. My window sill is so narrow, I can't fit a box fan. This seemed like just the thing except... would it really fit my 27"" windows (some reviewers would say no) and what about the wooden window trim problem? I've got aluminum trim.It was needless worry. The unit went in with 1/2 inch to spare and guess what? You don't have to use the wooden mounting screws. I grabbed 4 1""long machine screws with nuts to tighten them and extended the screws until it slide into the grooves of the window. Use some washers to reinforce the plastic. It does feel flimsy at the mount point. The pressure holds the unit in place. The fan is light enough and motor is smooth so it is unlikely it will vibrate itself out of the grooves unless I'm really careless about tightening the screws.I'm pleased this isn't a permanent solution (I didn't drill any holes in the trim). California summers sometimes get pretty darned cold so it's good to close the window entirely.I a very light sleeper so I would call the noise noticeable but not obnoxious except at the highest setting. But for my 1100 sq ft place, I can feel the air wafting throughout the entire length of the unit on high. There is no need to be in the same room to feel the benefit. I suspect I will use it before I go to bed and reduce the setting or turn it off.",positive
this fan is totally awesome! Its a bit heavy and you will need to kind of brace it in most windows but man.. the vent or exhaust features provide some great airation to the home . One of the best home fans I have purchased over the last few years... love it!,positive
"I just bought this heater after seeing a co-worker's unit.  My office area, in the corner of a very large room, is extremely cold all year round.  I have been getting by with a small DeLonghi Safeheat, but wanted something taller to provide heat to my upper body.  I also suffer from hot flashes so I needed something that oscillated.I didn't read any reviews here first.  Just went by my co-worker's glowing praise for hers.  She does sit in an office and I don't.  However, the features seemed to fit my bill.I am quite happy with the heater.  I appreciate the different heat and fan settings.  The oscillation works as I'd hoped - not concentrating the heat right on me.  It keeps me warmer and cuts the draft from the windows.  It is very nice to have a remote so I'm not jumping up and down to change the settings.  I bought it knowing that it would never really heat my area up to the temperatures given.  I just need my area warm enough to work in without a coat.There are only two drawbacks for me so far: the heater vents are about 5 or 6 inches up off the floor so the heat doesn't keep my feet warm.  I have to use the small one for my feet.  The second problem is the beep!  I can understand fully how this would be a problem in a bedroom.  It would wake me up!The light doesn't bother me since I only use it during the day.  I understand people's problem with them in the bedroom, though.  Between my Powerbook and the TV boxes, I swear my bedroom has more small lights than some Xmas trees!  I wish more engineers were aware of the studies on blinking lights and the concept of atavistic threat movement.  [g]For me, the heater only misses a score of 5 due to the annoying beep sound.",positive
This little fan really moves the air.  It'll cool off my whole downstairs.  I use it more than air conditioning when it's hot.  Saves on the electric bill.  I also have a smaller one in my bedroom and run that at night in the hot summers and it cools off our room better than air conditioning.  Good fan for drawing in the cool night air.,positive
"I'm so happy we have this fan!!!1. We turn it on &#34;reverse&#34; in the evening, drawing the cool air into our hot bedroom and it cools down the room a solid 10 degrees almost immediately.2. We leave it on all night in the reverse setting and it's completely changed our sleep pattern for the better. It keeps our room cool and drones out the loud road noise.3. I love having the option of having the window open still with the fan off and a soft breeze.4. The unit is not very attractive so we have a cafe curtain in front of it. When we turn it on, the curtain just blows upward and is not in the way.5. Install it on a window with a screen. We originally tried a different room, an old double hung window with no screen, and we woke up to a flying insect massacre on the floor. They were sucked in and didn't have a chance.",positive
"Having a small kitchen and not a great exhaust, solutions like fan windows are great, but all too often they are small and have to sit below the window. That means that when it rains or cold out, you have to remove the fan to close the window. This fan stays in the window year round but allows you to open and close the window without having to remove the fan!  Not only that, it's very powerful and VERY quiet.  Cooking smells are eliminated very fast with the three speed reversible motor. I even let my smoking friends sit at the table when they light up because not a particle of smoke enters the house with this fan running.It's a great solution for us and I'm on my second year of using it.",positive
I just bought mine from rural king for $59 . Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed. At 1/6 hp its  enough air for early spring/summer but during the dog days of summer when nights are still over 80 its not going to cool your house down you will still need the ac on those nights. But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like. You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in. The fan cannot cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler. The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two. Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before. But we will see how this fan holds up.,positive
"This will be my 6th Lasko 2155A Fan purchased since the year 2000.  I have kept 2 to 3 running at any given time between the months of March and November whenever possible/necessary.  This fan is one of 3 that work without flaws. We've tried to repair the others, cleaned them every year, to no avail.  Once the motor fails, that's it.  In fact, one of the first one's threw a fan blade which was quite loud.To deal with simple vibration, we devised a system involving thin strips of wood for the bottoms and 2x6s on the sides to provide a solid, semi-permanent gap fillers.  I painted the wood to match the room paint and it seems to work well.  Our windows are of the cheap variety (drywall with alum. windows wedged into place, no frames).I might have sprung for the next size up, but I couldn't afford the 100 bucks, not to mention, the motors wouldn't match up with the one's I'd purchased so far, IMO.  I just waited until amazon.com was selling this and pounced on it (due to the low price). I'm happy with these and will probably continue to purchase these if they are still made.  These fans really move the air in our house and I firmly believe they do work better when at least two are involved (one in, one on out or sometimes both on out with other windows in the house open) I'm lucky to have double doors in the ""two fans room"" that open up to allow a wide birth for the air to flow through.Small footnote: I did try ordering one from another good online store, but when that one arrived, the control knob fell off in shipment and wouldn't stay on.  Seemed cheaply made.  The one from amazon.com that arrive recently is intact and running smoothly, oddly with no vibration.UPDATE comment: as of 8/13/11 another of our fan's motors is acting up and I may have a theory about that.  Please comment to this review if you think this could be it.  I use non-aerosol hairspray (on my hair) in the room where the fan is.  Only fans that drew the air from the room were affected.  Just in the last two years we turned the fan direction to BOTH fans OUT in the room with two windows and the rest of the house windows open.  The hairspray presumably will end up being drawn up by the fans, especially the one I am standing 10 feet away from and right in line with.  In prior years, that fan was set up to allow air in, not out, for room re-circulation.  So in that case it was blowing the spray away from the fan.  However the other fan, further to the side in the second window (blowing out) was always the fan that developed motor problems; it would just bind up.  Opinions? (I have tried google.com to search for this possibility, to no avail).",positive
if you have side sliding windows you have to block off the gap above the fan.  the 'wings' that slide out to adjust the width of the fan are insufficient to support the fan vertically.  not a huge deal I cut a piece of foamcore to fill the gap but prevents window closing with fan installed.  It does draw a good amount of air and runs quiet enough on medium to sleep in the same room.,positive
First the pros: 1:Good value.  2: Moves a lot of air.  3: Reversible is great.Now the cons:  1: Very noisy on LOW speed.  2: Noise level is higher in reverse from added blade noise.  3 Very difficult to mount in window.I bought it for my bedroom but decided that due to the noise it was better suited to the living room. Still a good value but with  a couple caveats.,positive
"I started searching for a reversible window fan early, so that when the summer heat hits 99% I will be prepared. I had a Lasko reversible window fan that my sister gave me used, and that fan carried me thru some hot days for 6-7 years. I searched and found 3 fans and compared prices and wow-Amazon had the best price. I would recommend this fan to anyone who needs a great reversible window fan. I love it !",positive
"The vendor that this comes from 'Unbeatable Sale' sent the Heater with NO protective packaging. It was just sent as you would buy it at the store, which has minimal protection, and the box was Badly damaged when it arrived.I bought this heater because it is the best one I have used and when I went back to get a second one the store was already all out of them (Sears).The heater spreads the heat through a very large room (about 24 ft by 12 ft). Without it, the room just doesn't warm up no matter what other heater I tried.The other heater that works well in smaller size rooms and is smaller is the Holmes 1Touch heater. Sears was out of them too when I went back, fortunately I found them at Kmart too. Both have fans and really spread the heat throughout.For concentrated warm radiant type heat, my favorite is the Holmes 1Touch '319' model.I have tried many, and the best for spreading the warmth throughout and the fastest is this Lasko model, but I would not get another from the vendor on Amazon.",positive
"...for a fan that could pull air thru the whole house, but did not want to pay $200 for one.  This seems to have done the job,  I used it this past hot summer (2012) as an exhaust fan to move air in the house and to get it cooled off in the evening.  This machine seems to have done it, quietly...quieter that I thought it would be.  It is a two-directional fan, so you can bring air in or pull it out.  It also has 3 speeds, I used the medium speed all summer, 24/7.  No problems to report, would buy another.  I don't have AC here so this was it, and it stood the test. Recommended...",positive
"Really, this is close to an ideal fan if you want a window fan. The biggest issue is the way the fan mounts to the window frame. When you do it correctly it is secure, but not tight. There is just enough play in the way it mounts (drops down on screws) that there is a rattle when the fan is on. This was dealt with easily enough with some foam tape, but the tape needs occasional fixes.The ability to close the window while the fan is on, and reverse the airflow is great. For our apartment (1200sf) this fan can make a noticeable difference in temperature and air quality in about 5-10 minutes depending on the fanspeed. This is way more effective than sitting a box fan at the window because the airflow HAS to go through the window instead of cycling back into the fan.",positive
"I needed a good window fan to keep the air moving in my country cottage. I am able to limit the use of A/C if I have a means for proper ventilation. This fan satisfies that need.It was fairly easy to install but still required a bit of ingenuity as the side panels were a bit of a challenge. They will slide but be patient because they will also break if forced.  The fan is very quiet, emitting a hum rather than a roar when running at full speed.I will leave the fan in the window for the entire season so I will not have to struggle with the side panels again until it is time to remove it.",positive
this thing is so cheap that it started falling apart while i was installing it!!  just turning the knob to turn the fan off/on and changing speeds and you just know that it is not going to last very long. the electric cord is so short that you need an extension cord. we are talking cheap cheap cheap here. the plastic bends with the wind. what a piece of junk.,positive
This fan has run non-stop in a window since Feb 2013 without issue.The expansion panels are a bit flimsy.I note a $10 price increase since I bought mine.  Still the cheapest whole window fan I could find.,positive
"I installed this on a horizantaly sliding window.  It probably took about 10 to 20 minutes to install.  Its just 4 screws. It comes with a guide for the position of the screws which helped. It works awesome. You even have to put a door stop infront of a door in a beadroom if you have the fan in the room blowing the air in, otherwise its strong enough to slam your door shut. We liked it so much so that we bought a second one and installed it in the kitchen to clear the air when we are cooking.  we will usually put the fans on exaust and open up the living room window and it pulls in a strong breese with them both sucking the air thru the house.I can't recommend them enough, we wish we got them years ago!!!  Just make sure you open another window in the house so the air has somewhere to go.",positive
"I bought an Air King 20"" (same manufacturer of the Lasko) whole house fan a couple of years ago and it proved to be too much fan for my &lt; 2000 sq. ft. condo. I went for this 16"" and it does the job just as quietly as the 20"". Very easy to install within the window frame and no vibration. I only wish that the side extenders were metal like they are on the Air King. The grill on the front of the fan is metal. I am very happy with this purchase and that's why it gets FIVE STARS. These are both excellent, high quality fans and I would not hesitate to purchase again.",positive
"Fairly easy to setup, but you would want to set it up where it's fairly hidden from view.Unfortunately here in Hawaii, the place I need it most is in the Master Bedroom.  Not ony that it's in plain sight, but the window that I have it installed in, is the one overlooking Poipu Bay and it blocks the view considerably.I guess I can install it in the bathroom window but I'm not sure how effective that would be since my main goal is to blow the heat out of the bedroom and outside the opposite window.However, it is pretty powerful but rather noisy on full force and even in the mid force.  I have a T.V. in the bedroom and also a computer, and I have to keep it at low if I want to be able to hear the T.V.Does it work ... Absolutely ... Is it Noisy ... Yup ... Is it Ugly ... Yup!Update as of Feb 7, 2011:  Fan has developed a clicking noise mostly because the fan blade rotation is wobbly.  Sometimes the noise goes away but is infrequest.",positive
"I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods, when people smoke in the place, etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8"" window fan setup, and after several months of use, they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets, is giant, and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off, the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it, but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market.",positive
This replaced a fan I broke in a drunken episode on St Patrick's day. That was just plain dumb on my part but I am so glad that happened as this is the best fan I have ever owned. Wife and I sleep with a fan and I instantly noticed the fan pushes way more air then the other last fan I had. I sleep like a baby and even get cold from time to time which I never did before.,positive
"We have central air conditioning but only one control unit downstairs, so the second floor is always warmer and less comfortable than the first floor. I tried putting fans at the bottom of the stairs to the second floor to improve air circulation but the air did circulate well my old fans as they could drive the air up the stairs. Purchasing this pivoting fan made all the difference! This fan immediately help drop the temperature upstairs by about 2-3 degrees.I am attaching a collage of 5 photos under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.I LIKE:------1. The best feature of this fan is the pivoting ability of the fan. The fan pivoted and held its position straight out of the box, I did not need to adjust or tighten anything. Photo #1 shows the fan pivoting, Photo #4 and photo#5 show two views of the fan at the bottom of my stairs.2. Photo #3 shows the fan on the digital scale. The fan is fairly light just under 7 pounds and 2 oz.3. I like handle on the top of the fan. It makes it very easy and comfortable to carry it around.4. The fan is fairly quiet even on the high setting. It producing no rattle noises of any sort, the sound you hear is white-noise type sound of blades pushing the air. It is so quiet that on a number of hot nights I took that fan into the bedroom. I am a light sleeper yet the noise from this fan did not bother me even as I was trying to fall asleep.I DON'T LIKE:-------------1. Minor: the switch to turn on the fan in the center back of the fan. So when you pivot it up you need to reach under the fan to turn it on or off. Close-up of the switch is shown on Photo #2.2. Minor: the length of the cord is 6.5 feet. I wish it was longer. I have to use the fan with an extension cord.Lasko 3300 fan is sold under several slightly different names but with the same model number and description. From April 2012 to September 2012 the price of this item (when sold directly from Amazon with free shipping) varied between $30 and $34. At the time of writing this review the best price is on this oneLasko 3300 Wall Mount Fan.  I use a handy tool that helps my price comparison shopping on Amazon, if you search in google for Amazon price alert the one I use has 'camel' in its name.  It shows you the history and also can send you an email when your desired price is reached.Overall, I am very pleased with this fan and it quickly became my favorite fan of the 4-5 fans we have in the house: it pivots for great air flow control, it is powerful to quickly cool a room, and it is quiet to do its job without being noticed.Ali Julia review",positive
I actually had to return this product as it was completely thrashed from the shipping but this fan is well worth the money! It is a fantastic fan!,positive
For it's size this really is a light weight fan that blows a lot of air.  For the price I don't think you'll find a better fan.  We usually run it on low and it is relatively quite.  The only complain I have is the on/off controller switch is located on the back of the unit directly behind the fan blades.,positive
"Terrific fan, but pretty noisy.  It's great if you are trying to move a lot of air and don't mind the noise.I am glad that I made this purchase; it has been great this summer.",positive
"I've just returned from down the street where I ended up when I turned on the &#34;wind machine.&#34; (Which is tough because I was in my pagamas!) We had one of these, which was a little smaller, and I still like better because it isn't quite as strong.Seriously, with that much power, you needed a lower low &#34;LOW.&#34; The first night I used it in my bedroom this summer, I had to turn it off because it was just too loud on the lowest setting. The other thing I don't like compared to our old Lasko is that the speed adjustment is on the back (hard to get to in the middle of the night). Put it on top where it belongs! Who wants to do a reach around on a fan??",positive
"I bought my windmachine after my smaller honeywell fan finally died after a number of years.  In truth, I wanted it first and foremost for white noise for my bedroom at night.  To that end, it's been perfect.  It's a powerful fan, so both the high and medium setting easily drown out any unwanted noise.  Note that this is not a small fan.  It's just shy of 2' tall, so while the handle on top makes it portable, and it's built to stand on the floor, it's not made for a tiny bedroom.  The sound is smooth and steady and it does a tremendous job circulating air in a hot or stuffy room. I leave it on every night and it both helps me sleep and keeps me cool.  I could see this fan lasting for quite awhile and I'm still very happy with it a year later!  Included 2 images for a visual.",positive
"Before I finally installed air conditioning, I used this fan. In fact, I had two of them and used them for several years.This is the most powerful fan I've ever had. It doesn't rattle or clang like metal window fans. It really stirs up the air and cools the room.The three settings - low, medium and high - are achieved by turning a huge and easy to turn knob. You can tilt the fan up or down and than lock it into position using the knobs on the side. By placing one fan upward and another downward you'll get a wonderful and refreshing cross breeze.If you can't afford air conditioning or you live in an area that only needs a fan, you will love the WindMachine. I still use mine to dry clothes that I don't want to place in the drier. I hang them over the shower rod and turn the fans setting to high. The clothes are dry within a couple of hours.",positive
I had one for about 7 years and absolutely love them super high powered.  These fans move massive amounts of air.  The low setting is still very strong and kinda loud.  but high is like sitting inside a wind tunnel.  I have a standard box fan and this is 10x more powerful.  I highly recommend them.,positive
"I love this fan. It it large, but light weight and easy to move around. It moves a huge amount of air totally silently.",positive
"I had another Lasko Wind Machine and it lasted for years.  It finally bit the dust and I ordered this one as a replacement.  I'm not particularly fond of the &#34;on&#34; button being on the back, but the machine is very good at moving the air around.  Not quite as powerful as my old one, but still very good.",positive
Quiet and moves a lot of air. I use it by door and it blasts in cooler air in evening. You can easily adjust it as well... It was a good cost efficient solution,positive
I use this fan to keep the air circulating; living in an old house where the AC is not too efficient. This fan has great wind power. I will most likely buy another one in the future for another part of the house.,positive
It is an outstanding fan! I'm using it with another older wind machine from Lasko to help cool down my home in early morning hours!,positive
Have 4 Lasko fans and all work great.  They tend to burn out after 3 - 4 years but well worth the money.This one has the speed control on back & is solid as a rock.,positive
"This is the second Wind Machine that I've owned, our first one just stopped working after almost 10 years.  We use ours almost exclusively in our very large master bedroom on the high setting (we like the sound and the breeze).  Others mentioned that it's not all that powerful, but we find it plenty strong for indoor/casual use.  It's not an industrial shop fan by any means, but it's great for cooling a large room, painted walls, even outside on a deck.  It's very light for it's size and the tilting feature is nice.",positive
"We use floor fans so we can keep the AC at 80 and still survive in South Texas.  This was our first experience with this model, and we plan to get more of them.  They circulate the air superbly and make surprisingly little noise for their size.",positive
I need a fan to sleep by...the white noise is perfect.  It's quite powerful and slightly noisy.  I'm extremely happy with it and I think you will be too!,positive
"In my experience, Wind Machines are the best fans out there.  They are essentially the only type of fan we have used for years.  An added bonus is that they are ready to go right out of the box, no assembly required.",positive
"I don't often rave about a product, but this one deserves it.  This is what I so love about it: 1. Works like a dream. No rattles, shakes, quivers. Just a steady strong stream of wonderful air.  2.Well built.  It arrived in the military pouch system with the box a bit smashed, but not a single dent on the item.  3. It's light.  I can cart it room to room very easily.  Even though it's so light, it sits on the floor very stably.  4. The only sound it makes is the sound of air moving. no whine, no rattles, no vibrations.  5. No assembly required. None! 6. The design is compact, extreme care given to maximizing output for the footprint.  I'm impressed.",positive
"This fan is really handy to keep around. It is a bit loud on high, but I expected that with this type of fan. I can use it anywhere in my house and move it from room to room as I need it.",positive
Very powerful. I have two of them. They are very good for the price. Would recommend highly. Buy this product.,positive
This is a really great fan and I love that it tips up and down so you can move lots of air when the house gets warm.,positive
"This fan really moves the air. To give you an idea how good this fan works, do you know those 20"" box fans they sell for 15 or 20 bucks, well this Lasko 3300 fan on low blows as hard as the 20"" box fan on high. No kidding. I think this is by far the best fan I've ever owned.Will post a couple pictures for you to get a better look at it. I would recommend this to anyone in need of a fan. Don't hesitate, buy it.",positive
"Doesn't move as much air as I thought it would, being called &#34;Wind Machine&#34;. Not sure if I would buy another. Better than a box fan, for sure.",positive
"The Wind Machine fan by Lasko is exactly the way it is advertised here on [...]. It comes already assembled so setup is a breeze--just remove it from the box, set it up on a table and turn it on! The three speeds all operate relatively quietly and the fan gets the air circulating rather quickly.The price is right for what you get: my own fan is just about two years old now and it still works strong and hard to create good air flow. The Wind Machine also cools the room down on days when you can't use an air conditioner or when you simply don't want to use one.I recommend that the fan stand on a flat surface about three or four feet high so that the air current it creates reaches you whether you're lying down or walking around the room. It is economical in that it won't make your electric bill spike upward, too.Overall, this is a great fan and I highly recommend it as just about the best fan out there in this size and price range. It will not disappoint you!",positive
"First off if you are looking for a quiet fan, go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for. As the name says this beast is a WIND machine, it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1, a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2, and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep.",positive
"This fan will blow you down. Works just as good as the heavy duty silver fans. I sit my fan on top of my radiator or a stand right by the window at night and my room goes from hot to cold in a split second. It brings all that cool night air right into my house. All fans don't do this. Burrrrr I'm getting goose bumps now because I'm freezing. Let me get up and turn it to low now since its extremely cool in here. I have 2 of these. I used to have 3 but the third one disappeared. Maybe someone stole it.  Oh Well , anyway fan is definitely worth the price.",positive
great air mover for an awesome price... Compared to those pricey fans that don't rake reviews half as good as this.,positive
I had one of these fans that ran great for about 6 years....being used every day.  I like noise when I sleep at night and that was the primary function of this fan.....although it was so quiet that I needed to use it on medium or high to get the noise I wanted.  Good fan though and I will likely replace my dead one with another one just like it.  I'm surprised they still make this one and sell it.,positive
"A great fan, light weight, easy to move and aim!  I have especially appreciated this fan in our immediate 100 plus temps.  We use a heat pump which looses effectiveness past the ground level.  I place this fan over the top of the floor vent in the kitchen and it sucks up and sweeps the slower trickle of cooler air and spews it out quite well!Love this FAN!",positive
"The price is right and it moves air very well.  It is almost impossible to clean.  I used my two seasons, chucked it and got another one.",positive
This fan is really doing a good job. It is very powerful. This fan helps the whole house and keeps the air fresh and moving.,positive
"Even on the lowest setting, this thing is definitely a wind machine. While my apartment is central air conditioned, I like to keep the thermostat on 78 to save energy. Having this fan definitely helps things feel cooler and results in less trips to the thermostat to turn down the temperature.When you crank this thing up to high, it's really a force to be reckoned with. My cat is slightly scared of it on higher settings as it does get a little loud and moves quite a bit of air.Added benefit is that if you use this in a bedroom at night, it serves as a pretty decent white noise source as well.Great fan all around, especially for those hot summer days.",positive
I purchased this to use with my indoor bike trainer. Is somewhat loud but certainly does the job and more. I only wish it came with a remote control to change speeds.,positive
"I like the name of this product: ""Wind Machine Air Circulator."" I would have just called it a fan, but I guess the given title is more accurate. I love this fan. My apt gets super hot in the summer and without central air, it can be tough during the days. The AC we have isn't quite strong enough to really cool down the place below 77 degrees or so. This fan has made the summer so much more bearable. Moving air in the apt makes a huge difference. This fan produces a strong breeze/current. It usually stays on the low setting, as that is more than enough to provide adequate current in the room.The fan is pretty quiet. There's 3 speed settings, and of course if you have it on high, it can get a little loud. But it's not nearly as loud as other fans I've owned, so I was pleased with that. It barely weighs anything, so moving it from one room to the next, if necessary, is easy. It has a nice handle on top for easy transport. The fan can also be tilted easily so you can direct the air wherever you'd like. If you don't want the air blowing right on you, you can tilt it so it blows towards the ceiling. If you want it pointed at you, pivot it to the necessary angle.My only issue with the fan is the ability to clean it. It doesn't have any easy way to disassemble it, at least that I can see. I'm not motivated enough to REALLY take it apart, so I wish there was an easier way to pop it open and give the blades a nice wipe down. Because it sits on the floor, it often sucks up my girlfriend's lose hairs and the catch on the grill. Doesn't really cause a problem, other than being a little unsightly, but you'd get that with any floor fan so I don't blame this product for that.Overall, this is a powerful, yet quiet, fan and I'd definitely recommend it.",positive
We originally got the first one like this from Walmart years ago and they no longer carry them.  Found them on Amazon love them well priced and work very well! I feel like I'm in a room full of A/C when I turn these on.,positive
"This was my first pressure cooker.  I bought it because it was cheap and  be easy to operate.  It was both of these and more.  I learned to cook with this aluminum cooker, how to gauge time and amounts of water etc.  Mirro has been around forever and replacement parts are readily available for all their cookers.  As with all aluminum pressure cookers,  the metal will react with some foods and can overheat if you are not careful.  This style cooker has the ""jiggler valve"" on the top that rocks back and forth and hisses when pressure builds.  Personally, I like this as it provides audible and visual feedback as to what is going on inside.  You can go in the next room and still hear the hissing and know everything is going well.This (and all modern cookers) are very safe if you follow directions.  I was afraid of pressure cookers most of my life and this inexpensive one has soothed my fears.  It comes with a heat diffuser disk that sits on the bottom of the cooker and a nice instruction/recipe book.You can't go wrong with this, especially if you are a novice who does not want to spend big bucks on the electric cookers or expensive Swiss ones.  It does the job and does it well.",positive
"I received this cooker for Christmas 2008 ( a Wal Mart purchase).It was my first pressure cooker, and it cooked wonderfully (though it was a bit tight for two chickens); until it failed.After about 6 uses, it would no longer establish pressure.  The red pop up on the handle (indication that pressure was up and handle locked) started popping up to about twice the height it normally emerged from the handle (when the cooker worked) and steam vented from all around the handle junction with the lid.I tried everything the book said to do.  The handle was tight.  I inspected, streched and oiled the gasket. No luck.  I called Mirro (Wearever) and they told me to boil the gasket for 15 min. and then oil it.  I did all these things, to no avail.So I returned it.  Now I'm going to try Presto.",positive
"The wife and I got married in 1953. We got a mirro 4 Qt as a wedding gift. Use the cooker at least once a week. The lid gasget, jiggler, blow out plug are all in good shape. On thing we have always done is to wipe a little olive oil on the gasget. I think this little lubrication is the reason the gaget has lasted so long. Great old  pot--- I have a whole chcken jiggling away right now. Mmmmm.",positive
"I have been cooking with pressure cookers for 30+ years now. I had an old Mirro cooker (8qt) that I used for over 20 years. I had to buy a few gaskets over the years but it kept on working. The only reason that I had to purchase a new one is that I had cooked a chicken in it late in the evening and put the cooker out in the garage (it was winter) overnight. Believe it or not, a mouse got into the garage and chewed out the pressure check valve. I could not get a replacement because the cooker was so old!!! I bought the new one and I read the directions. Imagine my disappointment when I read that the cooker would not get hot enough on a ceramic top stove. I have had a ceramic top stove ever since they were invented and have used other pressure cookers on them with no problems whatsoever. Guess what? There was no problem with this one getting hot enough on the ceramic top either! It gets hot, gets to pressure and works just fine! Not sure yet if it will last 20+ years like the old one did, but I hope so!",positive
"Thing that surprises me is how expensive these can run.  A sound pressure cooker is a sound pressure cooker -- not much too it.  Never thought I'd own one (grew up with one -- home cooking), so thought I'd try it myself.So you know, bought one at Walmart (has the Wearever brand)-- $40.00, and it comes with a real return policy vs. Amazon's 30 day return policy (make sure you read that before buying anything here...surprising how inflexible they are if you miss it by only a few days, even for long standing customers who have never asked for any special preferences.)",positive
"What can I say except that this does exactly what it should.  I no longer have to borrow my mother's food press to make blackberry jelly.  Next year I'll make sure to make even more, since I won't be stuck doing it on a schedule.",positive
"I bought this only to make apple sauce. Growing up, my mother had one (for 25+ years) that all of us kids would use and this is nothing like the one we used to use. I have used it 6-8 times and have found the following:- I can only fit a very small bowl underneath it.- The legs slide all over the place easily. I have to grip the handle VERY firmly in order to prevent this from sliding all over the counter top.- The wooden pestle is already all dinged up and even has a chip in it.- The inside of the press is all scraped and dinged upIt does work fine, but the craftsmanship is very low. VERY thin metal, and I don't expect this to last more than 2 seasons of making apple sauce. If I had to do it all over again I would not purchase this item.",positive
"My 'ricer' - collander - food press arrived just an hour ago. I have fond memories of this 'ricer', a favorite kitchen implement of my Dad's. I still have an old pestle from the old days.  The design is a little different from the ones of my childhood, but I think this design appeals to me more.  I love 'riced' potatoes and anticipate using this 'food press' to make tomato purees and finish other fruit. I'm just excited to have it.",positive
"It works good but the one I wanted was the one that is pictured, just like my old one.  The one that they sent was more flemzy and not half as sturdy.  Just like all the new stuff these days.  Twice the price and half as good",positive

"This item is very hard to find.  Good if you are working with small quantities.  For larger quantities, use the kitchenaid mixer attachments.",positive
Can  not live with out this if you do any canning.  Have a OLD ONe and got this one so my daughter has one she is starting to take interest in canning  Recommend,positive
"Great when I used it for Apple Butter.  Sturdy, and washed up so easy.  I will be using this for many years.",positive

"I have owned and used 3 Presto Pressure Cookers in the past 35 years, they are the best! I owned another brand for a short time, it did not perform the way my Presto does, so I gave it away! I have never had any problem with my pressure cooker's, Presto is very easy to use, just be sure to use the right amount of liquid with whatever you make, after time you will be a pro and will be able to make up your own recipes, it is fast, and makes the most toughest cut of meat super tender! I usually cook my 7-bone roast for 45 minutes, and the meat just falls apart! Great for cooking Artichokes too, add 1 1/2 cups of water, your Artichokes, place the lid on and when the cooker comes up to pressure, reduce heat to a slow rocking (the pressure regulator you put on the top of the lid) and cook for 15-17 minutes depending on the size of the Artichoke, they will be perfect! Do your own experimenting and enjoy the cooker, you will be hooked just like me!",positive
"Back in the day, moms all had pressure cookers and made beef stews and pot roasts in them. These cookers are being rediscovered and are making a big comeback as they're not just for stew any more. Hundreds of new recipes are appearing and Amazon has some really good pressure cooker cookbooks available. We recently bought this Presto 4 qt. size (just for 2 of us) but larger sizes are available. Mom was right, they are FAST, make delicious food and will impress guests. They're not expensive - give this a try, you won't be disappointed.",positive
i love using a pressure cooker because it makes meats tender...also is faster too cook with.  I got for camping and keep my big one at home.  Also as its aluminum it's much lighter weight for the trailer.,positive
"I have had a few pressure cookers in the past and have found that they are still so useful even with all of our other technologies on the market today.

"There is little good about this Presto 4qt Aluminum pressure cooker.  It...Cannot keep the handle tight, I have to tighten it down about every other use.Cannot form a steam tight seal, steam leaks out around the handles, making them hot to touch, and through the pressure stem indicator that is supposed to seal off...it doesn't.Cannot keep the broth (fluid) inside from spewing out the weighted rocker pressure regulator even though the fluid level is well below the 4 guart level.Has no opposing handle; so picking it up while hot and full is problematic when trying to move the cooker to a faucet to cool it down.In a word, we got what we paid for...the cheapest and worst made pressure cooker on the market.",positive

We're pretty old, so I thought it was time to get my 79 year old cook, and lovely wife of 55 years a bright new pot instead of just another gasket.The old one worked well for all these years, and the new one already has a dozen or more cooking cycles on it - and appears to do as well as the one it replaced.BTW: we replaced a 6 quart Presto at the same time and the comment is the same on it.",positive
"Presto 01241 4-Quart Aluminum Pressure CookerGreat for standard pressure cooker needs, not larger enough for those really big jobs.Only issue I have is that the finish dulled completely when put in dishwasher",positive
"For those of you who eat things like wheat berries, this is the gadget for you. If you have a family, get the next bigger size, but this is good for one old guy who camps.",positive
"I was finally convinced that I need a pressure cooker for meat due to my work hours. I looked everywhere for the smallest size, they were either unavailable or too expensive. Reviews here showed great product so I bought it. I used it the very first day and I couldn't be more satisfied. Meat cooked in 12 minutes vs 30-45 minutes. I gave it four stars only because the color changes after washing it but that doesn't affect the cooking. It comes with directions which explained how long each food takes to cook.",positive
"Handle gets loose.  Also, the handle pops and breaks apart as it heats up.  It literally pops and explodes, bits and pieces go flying, hot drops of plastic! I returned mine.",positive
"I am using the cooker for about 3 years now and so far everything is going fine. This cooker is ultra efficient. Throw anything in it, it can make a nice well cooked food in 5-10 minutes. Key is let it cool off on its own. However, I really wish I purchased the steel one since aluminium body looks kind of ugly after some use.",positive
"About 4 quart aluminum Presto pressure cooker, purchased from Amazon. It is made in China. This item is made real cheap, it not only does not do the job, the screws of the plastic handle get lose all the time. I had used altogether 3 times and every time it did not do the job and after tightening the screw for 3 times the screw worn out. I realize amazon will only refund partially according to the return policy I just read. I will have to also spend more money for Shipping fees so I guess I can keep it for junk collection or throw it away. I never had rated any item I bought from amazon less than 3 stars but this item only deserve 1 star. I will not recommend to buy it. I still have a larger Presto steel pressure cooker, that works perfectly for years of use. I just wanted a smaller size. But wasted money for this junk.",positive
"It cooks very well, easy to use, zero problem and I use it regularly. Highly recommended. One suggestion: add a switch to let the steam go out once the cooking is done.",positive
"I have vivid memories of my mother and grandmother back in Cuba in the1950's when Cuba was free and beautiful and can yet see my mother cooking with these Presto pressure cookers almost every day...  So many great meals she prepared with it. I came to the US in 1965 and had to left them in Havana until 1970 when she and my father finally came to joint me here in the US.  After a few days of them here we went to buy  cooking utensils and kitchenware for our new home here in Miami.  I purchased for her a Presto 6 quart and 4 quart cooker.  Do not have to say she was delighted.  She used them like in Cuba, almost every day for many, many delicious meals, until she was very old (92 years old) and passed away in 1995.  I still have these Prestos and they are like new.  I just have ordered the gaskets and pressure valve through the Presto site here in the Web.  Just to say I cook a lot myself and used them very often.  Presto stands back on all their models and have replacement parts for all their cookers old and new.  They even have the originals Manuals with recipes and user instructions and times for every model the have ever produced.  I should say these cookers would last for generations if well treated and cleaned. They are part of the dear memories I have of my family.",positive
"Got it as a gift, it works very well, and has created many tasty meals in a short amount of time!its simple to use, but read the instructions first! the included cooking times book is a nice touch.I am happy with this purchase of the aluminum version vs the steel, the heat spreads evenly and is lighter. Costs a bit more but is worth it not to have burnt food at the bottom!it includes different racks as well for steaming.This is a good size for medium sized meals!",positive
"I really wanted to use this for sterilizing pint canning jars, but it is not tall enough.  however, it does cook an artichoke or two, and they get done fast, and they are cooked all the way through.  everything cooks faster under pressure",positive
I bought this to replace a Presto 4 Quart Pressure Cooker that was 45 years old and would no longer hold pressure even with a new gasket. It was a great unit and we hated to have to replace it. This new one works just as well as the old one did when it was new. You can pay a lot more for a pressure cooker but I don't see how it would work any better.,positive
"Great price and fast shipping. Includes recipe book and time tables, very important information when using this pot. So easy to use and doesn`t take up much space. Beef stew is awesome!",positive
"I will admit that my negative experience with this pressure cooker is partially my fault. I didn't realize that this model did not have a quick release. I should have noticed this from the photo so it is really my fault. I thought all modern day pressure cookers had quick release valves. I have an eight quart pressure cooker by Presto and I am in love with it. That is why I stuck with the same brand. I wanted to get something smaller to cook smaller portions of food.I also didn't like how I had to screw the handles into place. I want something that has permanently attached handles. I'm going to send this item back and buy another eight quart pressure cooker by Presto. I can't seem to find any smaller sized pressure cookers that have a quick release option. If anyone does, please let me know by leaving a comment or messaging me.",positive
"This is my first pressure cooker and I can't complain so far. Only advice I would do: make sure you screw the handle very tight otherwise you would get a loose grip, which is not the best experience to have while carrying a heavy hot pot...",positive
"I had always known that cooking under a higher pressure would accelerate the cooking process. I had just never realized by how much. With this pressure cooker, hours turn into minutes. Even slow-cooked chili which normally takes 6 hours of slow cooking to get it right can be done in 30 minutes. Amazing!This pressure cooker is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also remarkably easy to use, just put the lid on and rotate it sideways until the handles lock. It is also easy to clean, as easy as any other pot or pan.And there are soooo many recipes!Very much recommended!",positive
"I live at 9500 ft altitude where it can take many hours to tenderize anything. I cook stew meat in 25 to 30 mins, pot roast in 50 mins, veggies in 5 mins after it gets up to temp. Trick is to have only the small recommended amount of water.I've had the 6 qt stainless for 18 years and need to replace the rubber seal and plug every 7 years or so. I use mine a lot, 3 times a week ($7 for both at AMZ) which is why I am here commenting. Don't get the aluminum ones, not good for you.Very safe and fool proof. You can't open it until it stops steaming.Tales about dangerous come from Grandmas who were cooking in the 1930's, 40 and early 50's before safety features.Buy into their recipes not their tales.",positive
This thing has been great. I am still terrified every time I use it but it hasn't blown up on me so that's a plus lolWould have given it 5 stars if it didn't scare the hell out of me.,positive
"We really like this pressure cooker.  It is well made and the perfect size for our family.  We have cooked beans, chicken, beef, and many other items in it and it works great and is high quality.  Shipped fast & well packaged.",positive
"This is my second presto stainless steel. The first one is still going strong, in constant use since 1984. The old one is twice the size of this one, and I bought this smaller pressure cooker so I can cook smaller portions.it works perfectly as intended.",positive
"I was really looking forward to getting the Presto 6 Qt. Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker.  My mother had used one, and the name ""Presto"" really meant something to me.  Even though I was unfamiliar with this kind of cooker, the previous reviews left me confident that this one in particular would be a good choice.Yikes!  I opened the Amazon carton only to find a very small box for a 6-qt. cooker. Turns out, this pressure cooker will arrive at your door IN NEED OF ASSEMBLY.  Well, I was still game.  Pulled out my handy dandy Philips screwdriver and carefully followed directions.  The long handles had one screw only -- Not much for all the weight and pressure that pressure cooker handles must endure -- But I still gave it a shot.I made Chicken Chutney (recipe in the instruction booklet) which was ""okay"" -- Let's suppose that I haven't used a pressure cooker before (too true, too true).  So if the dish was ""meh,"" that could be my fault.  But ...As I was washing the cooker, it really became clear that the handle was loose.  The screw was as tight as possible (the instructions warn against screwing it too tight lest the plastic break), and the handle itself was clearly loose.  So. . .I am returning it to Amazon (they have made this very easy, UPS will even pick it up from my home).  In the meantime, I will be looking for a good quality stainless pressure cooker that is securely made, and doesn't come with ""assembly required.""",positive
"This pressure cooker is great for getting all of the flavors out of chicken and the broth gets a lovely golden color.Also good for stews.I know many people are afraid of using pressure cookers, but when you know the taste will be much richer,it's worth using,definitely.Highly recommended.",positive
"This is the first time I owned a pressure cooker. It's very easy to use and helps me cut down the time to cook beans, meat,.. subtantially.",positive
"At first I hated the heavy metal cap that sits on top of the steam valve.  I always forgot to take it off before opening the lid, and one time it fell down hard on the floor, almost hitting my toes.  Turns out there's a purpose.  It's a visual/audio indicator of how much steam is coming out.  If it rocks too fast then I'd need to lower the fire.  On a pressure cooker, more heat doesn't cook any faster.  It only wastes gas/electricity and drains out the liquid inside faster.Although the manual recommends waiting for the steam to go away by itself before opening the lid, or dunk the whole thing into cold water, which could be a few minutes.  I usually take a very long spatula, position my hand below the lid and gently pry the rocker cap off to let the steam out faster.  If you do this, be very careful or else you'd get burn.  Seriously, this is hotter than normal steam.It works very well.  Holds pressure much better than my old Mantra pressure cooker, and thus tenderizes the meat much faster.At first I was hesitant to buy stainless steel, because it's more expensive and doesn't conduct heat well.  But the bottom has a layer of other metal to absorb heat, so it's not any different compared to my aluminum Mantra cooker.  Stainless is easier to clean as well, and looks better.  Some people worry that aluminum causes alzheimer, but there's no medical proof of it.  Oh well, at least I get the stainless steel so that I don't have to wonder.",positive
"High quality stainless steel construction is a big improvement over the aluminum cooker it replaces, and the availability of the accessory lids make this capable of doing so much more than just pressure cooking. Brand reputation matters, we are sure that replacement parts from Presto will always be available.",positive
"I didn't grow up in a family with a pressure cooker (PC), so really the only thing I knew or thought I knew was that they were dangerous, hard to use, something from the past. Boy could I not have been more wrong. I started thinking of getting one probably for the same reasons you are, the appeal of fast cooking, with tasty and healthy results, and improved safety over the pressure cookers from the past. My wife and I have had this model now for a couple of weeks and it delivers on all counts.The basic idea is that because of the pressure that builds up inside, water gets to 250 degrees, it is super hot. And at that temperature it can break down the tough parts of meats and cook things very quickly. Yet it also retains nutrients and tastes good. Well it does cook fast and it is tasty. I will take the experts opinion that it is also a healthy way to cook.As a PC newbee I had no idea what to expect. First off is a little bit of assembly. That went quickly and smoothly. Second is READING the instruction booklet. This is not a pan or a microwave or something like that. It is safe..but also something that is, well, under pressure. And pressure can be dangerous. After getting familiar with the parts of the pressure cooker we cooked our first meal, a pot roast. It was super easy and delicious. We used, frankly, a pretty cheap piece of meat but it came out tasting fantastic. It was quick but something to keep in mind is cooking time does not usually include the time to heat it up and the time to cool it down. Also you can't just walk away. Once the pressure seals the cooker most of the time you have to then reduce the heat. But it really isn't that much oversight.In any event even taking all of that into account it was still by far the fastest pot roast I have ever cooked and better than average in taste. We have done some chicken dishes and some rice dishes. It has turned out perfect rice in a fraction of the time it would have taken otherwise. We are still getting a feel for seasoning. Sometimes we have had dishes too seasoned and other times not but nothing that hasn't been easily as tasty as other ways we cook things.So if you are a PC newbee like me I say give it a try. As long as you read the instructions and respect the pressure it is a pretty easy way to cook with excellent tasty results in a quick amount of time. Granted it has only been a couple of weeks but we have eaten out much less these 2 weeks. We picked up a well regarded cookbook on AmazonPressure Perfect: Two Hour Taste in Twenty Minutes Using Your Pressure Cookerand so far so good. This could easily become the main way you cook, it has that a good a combination of benefits and realtive ease of use. What it excels at is...great results/unit of effort and time. I can't see many other ways that you can maximize your cooking effort and cooking time than a PC.",positive
"I am very happy with this pressure cooker, seems to be very well made (which is important for safety). I bought it to cook beans but it comes with a few recipes if you are new to pressure cooking so I tried a roast beef one and it came out great.",positive
"This is my second presto pressure cooker in a year. I loved my first one and used it several times a week, but I didn't add enough water once, scorched the heck out of it, and it was never the same. I tried all the thrifty tricks to get out scorched ick but it didn't work. However, I liked and used this one so much I bought another one exactly like my first.I have a Russel Hobbes electric pressure cooker that is larger and really nice for food that cooks longer because I can set it and walk away. However, it's big and bulky. My Presto is my go too pressure cooker for potatoes, makes great cheesecake, I love pressure cooking squash, carrots etc. The construction is heavy and seems well made.",positive
"Just received this unit, and I'm very happy with it so far. It is easy to assemble, sturdy, and most importantly has a very simple design which I anticipate will be durable into the future. My previous pressure cooker was a complex affair with springs and components tucked away in plastic housing so that they could not be accessed. This design, on the other hand, is much more simplistic, which is a very good thing. It cost about 1/4 the price of the cheapest PC that I could get in local stores (including postage), and is a preferable design.",positive
"Works, but, wish there were an easy way to tell if you're out of water",positive
"Bought this on November 13 last year. Have used it 10 (that's ten) times. I only hand wash it; I do not use the dishwasher for cleaning it. I use a dishrag plus a fabric coated sponge for washing dishes. No scratchers have been used on it. It is currently showing rust spots around the top edge. Fortunately I did not pay a lot for it, but it still was too high a price to pay for a piece of cookware that basically only lasted a little over 2 months as I don't wish to eat rust.It is also very lightweight compared to the old pressure cooker my mother had for over 40 years; maybe that is why the metal isn't very high quality.Firm believer in the old adage that you get what you pay for; my bad. Have ordered another brand that is pricier. I am not in the financial position to pay more for one specialty pan than I did for my entire set of stainless pots and pans, so we will see how this next one works out.",positive
"I have only had this for a few weeks. I have cooked Winter squash a couple of times and it worked great. I don't admit to being an expert on pressure cookers but this one seems to work very well. The handles came loose the first time I used it, so tightening them really good the second time seems to have done the trick.",positive
"It's the right size to cook a roast and it's easy and safe to use.  What I usually use it for is to cook up a 3-5 pound boneless chuck roast (when it's in sale).  Here's what I do:put in a couple of tablespoons of oliver oil and brown the meat top and bottom.  Take the meat out, toss in the trivet and put on top of the roast 2 cut up carrots, 2 stalks of celery cut up and half one large or two medium peeled onions.  Throw a few peppercorns, 1 or 2 bay leaves and some dill weed on top and pour in a can of beef stock and add a little water.close the lid firmly and put on the regulator, and after it starts up, it's 45 minutes to a perfect pot roast.Everyone's got tricks for lowering the pressure, I just use a wooden spoon and after turning off the gas burner, I simply push down on the round black rubber and release the pressue until the silver button drops.  There!  No fuss or hassle and this method does not hurt the unit at all.Yes, the handle is a bit short, but it still works very well, especially since I never have to carry it full to the sink to run cold water to release pressure.  I've never had a problem with this pressure cooker (buy the stainless and not the aluminum!)I've had mine for over 3 years and use it mostly in the winter months...I've probably made 20 roasts in the unit.",positive
"Strong words for a pressure cooker, I know, but this thing has been such a disappointment.  I bought it to replace my old 6-Quart Presto pressure cooker that worked well and faithfully for many years.  I'm not sure if they have started making these things in China after I purchased my last pressure cooker or what.  This new one is much lighter weight and the metal feels thin and cheap.  The handle screw continually comes loose which makes the handle itself loose and wobbly.  The pressure hole doesn't seem to line up properly so that I have to use a knife to wiggle the pressure button free to pop up so it can start to cook after the pressure builds.  If you are looking for a solid, reliable pressure cooker - - keep looking!  This is not the one!",positive
"I had never used a pressure cooker before but have been planning to buy one for a while, and decided to buy this one because it looks well made and has good reviews.I tried cooking several vegetables and some Sirloin tips (separately) and found the Sirloin surprisingly tender, the vegetables retained a lot more flavor.I did carefully read the instructions and after one or two uses found it easy to use. I bought a timer to use with it because cooking times seem to be important as does making sure it does not boil dry.This is a great time and energy saver, resulting in great tasting food!",positive
"This is my first experience with a pressure cooker.  Coming from an asian background it's not something we normally cook with.  We normally go the ""slow cooking"" route instead to make our soups and broths.  This item is great in that you can make some good stock and soups etc in about 60 to 90 minutes.  I tried using this for the first time yesterday and it was great.  My wife was extremely skeptical at first, to the point of getting a backup plan for dinner but she's happy it worked out.The unit is well made, the handle locks easily and it has a safety feature that wont' allow you to unlock it when there is pressure.  the ONLY thing you have to worry about is knocking over the weighted pressure release and allowing steam to fly up.It does make some noise but I like it, it allows me to hear from afar if the heat setting is correct.  I find the size of the cooker to work well for 3-4 adults.  If you have more than that, get the 8qt or larger cooker.My ONE concern with this is losing the pressure release weight...other than that, I just bought another one to give to my mom :)",positive
One of the better pressure cookers we've owned.  We cook rice and lentils a lot in our pressure cooker and this makes it perfect each time.  No issues that we've had with other brands like Prestige.,positive
"I've had several pressure cookers.  This one is easy to handle, good quality, and so far so good in terms of stains.  I read the instructions, and follow them to the letter.  Love my pressure cooker.",positive
"I have been using Presto Pressure Cookers for the past 35+ years, they are simply the best on the market, and I have had other brands, those other brands ended up at my yard sale, the Presto Pressure Cooker is the best! always reliable, and I have never had to replace the gasket, that is saying something to the quality of the product, which by the was has been on the market for longer than I have been alive, and thats a long long time, so why bother with the rest when you can have the best, and at a great price, give it a try, you will be delighted with all you can make and the time saved cooking this way, especially cheaper cuts of meat,I can't say enough good things about this pressure cooker!",positive
"I had one of these great cookers long ago.  My old one was very heavy.  This one is made of stainless steel and seems to be lighter.  I had to attach the handles, so some assembly on this one is required.  My first recipe was, 'Ham Hocks & Navy Beans', and I cooked the pre-soaked beans and ham hocks in about 25 or 30 minutes.  They turned out great, but had to guess at the cooking time, as the recipe was not in the enclosed instruction/recipe booklet, but in my head!  Since then, I have purchased two great pressure cooker cookbooks.  I plan to cook many more dishes in this quick-cooking appliance.  Be sure to read THOROUGHLY, the instruction booklet, to safely use this(& all) pressure cookers.",positive
"I cook daily in a pressure cooker so this product is very important to me. I have a Hawkins 2 liter cooker, prestige 3.5 liter and a presto 6 quart pressure cooker but they are all aluminum. I've had the presto 6 qt aluminum for at least over 6 years. It works very well. The best thing about it as compared to Hawkins and Prestige is that it doesn't let pressure off in loud installments (which scares the kids), its more like a consistent whistle.The main reason to buy the 4 qt steel cooker was to have a size between the ones I already owned, suitable for a family of four, and also the reason that stainless steel doesn't react with the food, which is important to me because I often marinate the meat before cooking certain dishes.The new presto has a flatter bottom which sits better on my cook top unlike the old one which rocks a little bit, the heating is even and its easier to clean as well. What I didn't like is that the steaming plate that comes with the cooker is  made of aluminum. But its not a deal breaker for me. I think that Presto is a very dependable brand and I'll happily recommend it to anyone.",positive
"It is a good pressure cooker.  I only have one complaint.  The handle seems to loosen after using it several times.  I had another one, and it did the same thing.  I just tighten it.  Presto is one of the best, but I think they should address the handle problem.",positive
"I remember a bit of a kitchen disaster during my childhood when the seal blew off my mother's pressure cooker.  Even after a thorough wipe down of cabinets and walls, we were still finding bits of broth and meat fat blown everywhere for the next few days.  I've lived in fear of them ever since, but finally decided to take a chance on one after reading that the models made after 1990 were much safer.I'm glad I changed my mind.  It's super for quickly making beans and brown rice which otherwise take so long.  Meat browns easily in the pan and then, when sealed, those cuts of beef, pork, or chicken cook and tenderize in a flash to be used in burritos, enchiladas, or pasta meals.  Everything cooks to perfection in just a fraction of the usual time.I like the fact that this Presto model is stainless steel rather than aluminum.  However, since aluminum is a better conductor of heat, this Presto model has a bi-metal base with a disc of aluminum welded to the outside bottom of the pan.  This pressure cooker set includes a special insert rack that allows you to cook multiple foods at once without their flavors intermingling.  (This, of course, only works if the various foods are not suspended in the same liquid together.)This Presto model is safe because it won't open while still under pressure.  If you're pressed for time, you can run cold water over the lid or set the pan in cold water to drop the pressure more quickly.  When filled, it is a bit heavy and it take two hands for me to carry it.Clean-up isn't difficult.  I wash it by hand even though it is considered dishwasher-safe.  The top can be soaked in hot soapy water to get it thoroughly cleaned.It comes with a book of recipes which include soups/stews, roasts, vegetables, rice, and desserts.",positive
I like this little cooker.  It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods.  The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research.  I would recommend this.  Keep in mind that you do not use the entire 6 QT so buy a larger one if you need to make 6 QT of food.  The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times.  I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong.  20130130.,positive
This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.  I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto.,positive
"This is not my first pressure cooker. I was looking for a replacement for some weirdo one my hubby's ex left him years ago. I have a giant-sized Presto pressure canner and love it. So I like Presto and liked the size of the ex's weirdo canner. (weird because it had handles that came off all the time, no instructions, no visible brand I could find and was a strange operator.)I wanted stainless steel--easier in the long run, to clean and to cook in. Six quarts is just about the perfect size since I rarely cook for a crowd anymore.This is a nice, solid, reliable cooker. Presto does a good job on the owners manual, some basic recipes, etc. The cooker has a little rack so you can keep your meat off the floor of the cooker.This is not a canner. You could (and I have) use it as a little baby canner for a small load of small jars. I have used it as a canner for about 4-5 pints. The instructions do not say this is a canner, and you probably should know what you're doing if you plan to can with this. It takes about the same amount of time whether you can in this or in the giant cooker, so why not do a large load, I say.Pressure cooking doesn't necessarily save time depending on what you're cooking, when you consider it takes a while to build the pressure. This takes some practice, and knowing your food and your stove. I like it because it cooks meat really tender quicker than any other method.It takes very little experience to get to know the proper pressure without a guage. It makes a rythmic rocking noise, not too fast,not too slow.I find clean up a breeze. This baby is dishwasher safe. I soak it a couple minutes, if needed, then pop her in the DW. Take the rubber gasket off first. You should always hand wash the gasket.",positive
I love it. I would go for the 6 quart for extra room next time.,positive
"I have an electric pressure cooker that has a hard anodized interior that is sometimes impossible to clean.  This stainless steel pressure cooker is a breeze to clean.  As soon as it arrived I went to my local hardware store and replaced all of the screws with stainless steel because that seem to be a problem with other users.  I soaked some black beans and after only 4 minutes cooking under pressure, I had a pot of beans.  The 6 quart size is perfect for me since you can't fill it too much.  I just love my new pressure cooker.  Looking forward to many great meals.",positive
"Great cooker.  I have been using this one since about 2008.  Very reliable, nice flat bottom that is very thick.  I use it on a glass top stove without any problem.",positive
"My firstPresto 01781 23-Quart Pressure Canner and Cookeris for canning. It is this huge cooker, not for your everyday meal. I picked the 4 quart cooker for its' size. I want to make smaller sized meals. If you give me a large pot, I am going to fill it up! Then I have to deal with all the left overs. This cooker is the right size for two with plenty of left overs for the week. My first recipe was with dried beans (black, pinto) for chili. The booklet said only cook for 3 min. after the quick soak (one hour). I did't believe that was possible. Because I have tried to cook dried bean on the stove top and it took hours and hours. And they still weren't done to my liking. So I left the beans in about five min. they were almost over cooked, tender and delicious!I am going to love this cooker. Next up is tough cuts of beef. See what I can do with them. Keep in mind you can only fill it 2/3 full while cooking with pressure. I believe this so food particles don't get trapped in the vent.The basic theory is you cook the longest cooking time ingredient first. Let's say, chuck roast then you release the pressure when almost done. That's the time you add Potatoes, onions seasonings and carrots. After reading the booklet for cooking times and recipes it is almost faster then a microwave oven.....REALLY!",positive
"We have had a pressure cook for many years.  It was great for camping, for we could make New England Boil Dinner.  My wife has our old one at the shore, and we use it a lot.  However, many of the family are not there but in our villa 100 miles away, and we like many meals that we us the Presto pressure cooker.  Now, I can make the dinners here, and we thing they are the best pressure cookers around.  It is great time saver.",positive
"This was purchased to replace an 8 quart aluminum Presto.  The lid must have been ""sprung"" because it didn't want to close.  The handles and screws were not as good as those on the aluminum Presto models I've had.  Amazon's shipping box was fine when it got here, but inside the manufacturer's box was mangled - leading me to believe it was that way before it was packed.There was a dent on the side of the cooker near where it rolls underneath to the bottom.I returned it to Amazon - they gave me a full refund.  I got aFagor Futuro 10 Quart.MUCH more expensive, but it's easily the best pressure cooker I've ever had, especially the built-in pressure regulator.  And it's made in Spain, not China.",positive
"i bought this over a year ago and finally decided to write a review after having used it.  I didn't think it was gonna be a very smart purchase as it seemed to be limited in the uses.  well let me be the first to say i was wrong.  Making soups and stews are a no brainer, making a modest batch of soup stock in short notice is such a time saver.  take the bones and a few root veggies add water, let the cooker come to a pressure and leave for 45 minutes and you have some decent soup base.  The same lines as stews, get some cheaper cuts of meats and cube it up, add your standard seasoning and a can of beer let it run for 15 odd minutes turn off the heat and let it come down in pressure by itself and you have one awesome tender meal.  yeah, you could make the same thing in a regular pot but when you get the same results in a short time it's a simple answer.  why slave in the kitchen when you can be almost a one pot meal.  plus these meals are awesome in the fall.",positive
"This is a no-frills pressure cooker.  It could be a little bigger, but it does the job very well.When 'boiling' food in a traditional pot, the food cannot exceed 212 degrees F (the temperature at which water boils).  Under pressure, the boiling point rises...  in this pressure cooker to about 250 degrees F.  This means, of course, that food cooks faster (the reason people normally think to buy a pressure cooker), but the higher temperature also allows other 'reactions' to take place while cooking... For instance, the tougher fibers in meat will convert to gelatin, making the meat more tender.  As a result,  pressure cookers are great for braised dishes with tough meats, such as chili.  For these purposes, this pressure cooker rocks.Larger pressure cookers can also be used for canning (because the higher temperatures can kill more bad things.  This pressure cooker really is not large enough for this task.  If you are not a canner though, compare the prices of this against those larger models... I think you will be back looking at this one.",positive
"I'm a novice pressure cooker user but this one ""just works"".  Simple to use both for pressure cooking and for sauteeing.  I like that it's stainless and that it was cheap!",positive
"Thin metal burns easily and stains easily and VERY difficult to clean...I should have bought a better quality, much more durable (more expensive) item.Save your money, buy something else. Something of better metal (mettle).david",positive
"Aside from it being a pressure cooker, this is the nicest pot I own.  It also comes with a useful recipe booklet.  I can't add much to all the 5-star reviews here, but for what it's worth, 'I like it too!'",positive
Presto is one of the few old time manufacturers that have maintained quality.  This pressure cooker is very well made and works perfectly.  Looks nice and cleans up easy.  I would recommend it to a friend (or even a stranger).  I am very happy with it and fully expect it to last for many years.,positive
"I've been using a pressure cooker ever since I was young.  Everyone in my family has one and they do last for a long time.Now, I cook professionally.  One of my valuable cooking vessel is the pressure cooker.  It takes really tough meat and make is buttery soft.  I haven't tried cooking veggies on these things, just because they are more delicate than a piece of shank.  By the way, I just ordered two for gifts.  And it made from stainless steal.One word of caution though!!!...  When cooking with this, make sure after you hear it whistle, turn down your heat to a low medium to a medium!!!..  All you want is a soft whistle.  It's compared to having a roll boil and a boiling water; it's just a waste of energy. Violent whistling means, too much pressure is building up, not good coz, the food can only take a certain pressure to still be recognizable, and the pot can only take so much pressure.  I've heard form a couple of users who neglected this ""alarm"", actually had their ""tops"" blow up.  A couple of users also reported, they actually got burned by the steam.  Also, if you have to move the pot while is hot and still whistling, do it carefully, make sure it level and place it down carefully or the pressure might burst the top off.  But, don't let this scare you!!!  Like any other tools, you have to know how to use them properly.  A knife should be used with care.  A pressure cooker!!!  A LOT of care and common sense.Tips and advice:  When cooking stews and other stuff, make sure you dont' have too much liquid or meat/veggies when cooking or you might end up with burnt food or worst, a stew geyser.  If you need to add more stuff to the pot while it is still hot and whistling; care fully place the hot pot under running cold water and cold bath and wait for the pressure to decipate.  Always clean the rubber seal coz, it does accumulate food residue.  And always, always be careful with dealing with high pressure and high heat.  Happy cooking.",positive
"This is a really excellent item....but the little rubber safety button (to release pressure if something gets clogged) isn't as good as it could be.  Every now and then, it releases the steam so no pressure can build up.  If I jiggle it, to get it to set, it generally falls down into the kettle.  At that point, I have to remove the lid, and fish the button out of whatever is in there -- easy if it's broccoli, but more of a problem if it's bean soup.  I realize that this is my fault for not checking it each time, but with my old one (not nearly as good, overall) I never had to think about it.  Remember, this is a GREAT pressure cooker -- I'm just kvetching.",positive
Love this long lasting and dependable pressure cooker! I got it many years ago and haven't even had to replace the rubber yet. Works great every time.,positive
I was going to spend more money on a more expensive model... however i read some reviews and people swore by this product.I bought it and first day i bought it i pressure cooked a whole chickena nd it turned out great.  IT does the jobs without frills and cleans up great.  Good thing is... if it hits the fan than i can just buy another to replace it.,positive
"This was purchased for my mom who only uses Presto Pressure Cookers, the problem is hers are all aluminum and my husband and I have been after her to replace them with stainless steel.  While visiting her over the Christmas holidays, we ordered her this pressure cooker which arrived while we are still there....quick delivery, that's an Amazon Prime perk!!!  Needless to say she immediately throw out the old aluminum pressure cooker.  She is very happy with her new one and so are we.",positive
"I always avoided pressure cookers until a little over a year ago. I purchased the Presto 6-quart electric version. I love it, but it is annoying to have to drag it out when I wanted to use it. I saw this smaller size stove-top variety and hoped it would be as good as the electric. It's better!  I never put it away because it has become my go-to pan whether or not I'm using the pressure cooking feature. It's a good weight, great heat distribution, NOT aluminium, and sturdy. As a pressure cooker, I find that I can turn the heat on my stove to between 2 and 3 and it works beautifully. From using the other pressure cooker once or twice a month, I find I use this one three-four times a week. Minor issue - yes - the screws do rust. One of these days, I'll take one to Home Depot so I can get a non-rusting version.",positive
"I like it, and I use it occasionally.  It seems sturdy and safe.  I'm glad I got it.  I have no complaints.",positive
"my mother used her pressure cooker to feed 5 kids on a regular basis, and the stories of her mother's old ring-style pressure cooker, well... just hilarious.  I have no such entertaining stories, just dozens of great meals cooked quickly and well in a cooker that goes directly into the dishwasher, no fuss, no muss.  Learn how to use one and you will never live without one.  This one is quite good because if the cooker isn't stainless steel, putting it in the dishwasher will turn it white.  And certain ailments claim a link to higher levels of aluminum in the blood.",positive
This order was a terrific bargain!  The product is excellent.  The results are good.  I'm very pleased.  I would recommend to prospective buyers that they ascertain their needs first.  I should've gotten a 6qt size.  Unless you're apt to prepare fairly small meals the 4 qt is small.If you cook for one or two and don't make large meals this 4 qt is ideal.,positive
"I gave this Presto 6-quart pressure cooker to my daughter for her birthday .  She works full time and thought this would be a real time-saver for her.  It has met her expectations and is very happy with it.  She's able to prepare meals in minutes, which means she's not only saving time, but eating better.  In comparing this unit with others available, the price was great and turned out to be a very good value.",positive
"This pressure cooker is our first one and our first time to cook with one. We used one of the recipes printed in the user's manual, Herbed Chicken. The recipe calls for basil, celery, oregano, parsley, onions, and garlic, along with other readily available ingredients. Total time for the meal to be ready from food preparation, to the pressure cooker building up to pressure, with the actual cooking time was about 15 minutes.The Herbed Chicken was absolutely delicious. We can't wait to try another recipe. We also ordered 2 pressure cooker cookbooks. It really is satifying to own a fine and affordable cooking appliance such as this one in which we can cook delicious, nutritious meals that are prepared within 15 minutes. It was not difficult to use, and clean up was effortless and fast. We did read the user's manual carefully since this was our first time with one.The price was very reasonable, and this pressure cooker has a 12 year warranty (according to the user's manual). Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery service, and thanks Presto for the fine pressure cooker. We look forward to using it on a weekly basis.",positive
I have used this cooker quite a number of times and it does an excellent job of what it is suppose to do.,positive
"I've used a Premium grade, Innova 8 Qt. for years, It is way too big for every day, single person use. The Presto works decently, but not well built. The handles are fastened by only one screw. The lid closing stop, catches past the point it should be. The lid pressure open-lock safety takes effort to seat when heating up.The 4 QT and 6 QT are both 8 1/2 in. Dia. Without the lid, the 4 Qt is 4 1/2 in. height, the 6 Qt is only 2 in. taller making it the better option. A few recipes are too big for the 4 Qt.Induction compatible??? A magnet sticks to the bottom and top, but not the sides.",positive
"This was purchased as a gift for my daughter.  I have owned a Presto pressure cooker for years, but mine is aluminum, but I purchased this one for her, because she really likes stainless steel cookware.  Hopefully she will enjoy hers as much as I do mine after many years of use. It makes the best beef stew ever.",positive
"It's a good pressure cooker that works well for most of my cooking.  The only drawback is the pressure is fixed at 15 psi (my old pressure cooker had 3 different weight rings that you used individually or in combination to vary the cooking pressure).  However, unlike my old one, this one works on my induction plate which makes it much more economical to cook by using so much less electricity.",positive
"I replaced my old Aluminium Pressure cooker (4 Litre) from India with this wonderful stainless steel pressure cooker. The quality is great and the price is fantastic. The pressure cooker from India blew a whistle by itself to let out the pressure and 4-5 whistles were enough to cook lentils, rice, potatoes etc.. This cooker does not blow the whistle by itself (starts rocking) but instead I manually let out the steam 4-5 times. Saves a lot of energy and cooks quickly. I have 2 dabbas ( containers ) from the previous cooker that fit inside this cooker. That way I can cook Dal and rice at once. Definitely recommend this cooker. I ordered an extra gasket just in case :) Always better to keep extra gaskets",positive
"i rate this product 5 stars for its quality to price ratio and simple yet practical designalthough i can tell this is not the &#34;best&#34; or most expensive pressure cooker in the market, it certainly is good enough for my family. so far i have made great indian food successfully with no problems and its fairly simple to clean",positive
"I have had a 4 quart Presto stainless steel pressure cooker for 28 years and it is still going strong.  I decided I needed a 6 quart for larger meals.  Naturally, I bought another Presto.",positive
"This item is replacing an aluminum 5 QT cooker.  Stainless steel is far superior for cooking and cleaning, and the 6QT size is perfect when four are being fed.  Even spaghetti sauce is a snap with this unit, something I never attempted in the old aluminum pot.",positive
"I have several larger pressure cookers, but there are just two of us now that the children are gone and married. This pan is perfect. Like the extra handle on the opposite side - easier for transporting from stove to sink. Would certainly recommend this.",positive
"My old MirroMatic pressure cooker was over 40 years old & I decided it was time for a replacement.  Instead of the old all aluminum pan I decided to get the stainless steel pan for ease of cleaning.  What a difference!  The aluminum core on the bottom provides the even heating, & the stainless steel makes for the easiest of cleaning.  I really enjoy the rocker weight on top instead of my old weight with 3 different pressure settings.  This one is so much quieter, too.  Tonight, I'm making Swiss steak with only 18 minutes of cook time.  You can't beat that.  The cool down time is much faster than with the old aluminum pan also.  I should have bought this years ago.",positive
Awesome.  It is worth every penny I  invested. Moderately priced and cleans up well I hand wash this. I highly recommend this product!,positive
I can't believe I waited this long to buy a pressure cooker. This one is dabomb. Just the right size and seems to be of high quality. I'd recommend this cooker.,positive
"I prefer meat browned, and veggies either raw, stirfried, fermented or roasted, so I got this primarily for making bone broths, cooking legumes and cooking whole grains.I got the 4-quart as it's just me and hubby here, but I did not realize you can't fill this more than 2/3rd full.  Now I wish I'd have ordered the 6-quart.Even though it's stainless, it's very lightweight.  This is handy as I have permanent chest pain after surgery, so lifting can be difficult.It works fine.  It makes very concentrated fast broths in the summer when I don't want things simmering on the stove for hours.  Similarly, I can cook big batches of legumes and freeze in meal-sized portions fast.  I haven't tried grains yet as I was on a risotto kick when this arrived, and then went on a temporary grain-free diet.I am quite satisfied, except I wish I'd gotten the larger one.",positive
"Amazing quality ... made a whole chicken in less than 30min... juicy and perfect.. moist... cleans up beautifully... Very pleased with this product!...Just wanted to add a note.. I never run water over the pan to cool it down...as it is still cooking.. I know how long meat and veggies take when cooking traditionally, so I time it based on experience. When you let it cool on it's own, that is part of the actual cooking time with the pressurization. Follow the instructions and you can't go wrong.  I just shut the fire down about 10min less to incorporate cool down... Any longer would be overdone...",positive
"I already own a 6qt Fagor over 15 years old and a 2qt Kuhn Rikon.  This is much better than the KR and in every way as good as the Fagor and it cost 1/5 the price of the KR and half the cost of the Fagor similar model.  Based on other reviews I replaced the Steel Screws with Stainless  2 each 10-24 x 3/4 pan head, 2 each 8/32 x 1/2 pan head and two 8/32 x 1/2 inch flat head.  I used locktite red on each to prevent them from loosening. So far no rust and no loosening.  Cost for the bolts was around $3 and since I had to assemble the handles anyway only the two flatheads inside the lid had to be removed from the original item.  Note the top is not stainless though or is a cheap imitation thereof..  It is magnetic so probably steel.  The pot itself is stainless.  Unlie the KR and FAGOR this pot weight wobbles making a noise.  I like that.  Aural and visual indication of pressure.  Nice..  Finish and fit are fine.  Bottom thick enough but not very thick.  All in all for $36 a good deal.  I am retiring the KR. because the screws keep pulling out of the handles (no inserts like this one) and other things keep failing like the gasket and handles themselves.  KR maintenance $30 per year, Fagor $0 per year (gasket once during it s 15 year life so far)  This pot, who knows, not much to go wrong.",positive
"I did quite a bit of research online before purchasing this pressure cooker. It's definitely not top of the line but it absolutely does the job at a economical price. This is my first pressure cooker so I wasn't even sure if I would use it often, but the Presto has won me over. I use it multiple times each week - it's a fantastic convenience. Note that there is some minor assembly required.",positive
"I've used pressure cookers for many years including some of those very expensive models.  This is one of the best cookers I've ever owed.  This cooker is constructed of high quality stainless steel and is very easy to use.  Pressure cookers are very safe. If you follow a few simple rules, you'll never have a problem.  I use my cooker weekly for everything from cream of potato soup to braised lamb shanks with wine sauce.  Additionally, it is amazingly cheap to own. My only con: wish it was made in the USA, otherwise, highly recommend.",positive
Pressure cookers are great.  They are real time savers.  The only caution is if you are cooking for more than 2-3 people you may want to get a 6 or 8 quart.  You can only fill 2/3 of the pot up and it limits how much you can cook.,positive
"They are so quick and efficient.  When my last cooker warped I asked for a replacement for Christmas - yep, that's how much I love them.  My last pressure cooker was also a pressure caner for putting up vegetables.  However we are down to just my husband and I so we don't do much canning any more.  So he bought me this smaller version.  Obviously it weighs less, takes up less room in my cupboard, and comes to heat much quicker.  What isn't to love if you are cooking for only two people as we care!",positive
"I had an older model for years, and I wanted another Presto.  This one, as my older model, works great!",positive
This was a gift for someone that was just getting into caning.  Great product with great durability.  Buy with confidence here.,positive
"The excellent instruction manual that comes with this cooker lists appropriate cooking times for many kinds of food. I really appreciate cooking brown rice in only twelve minutes and pre-soaked beans in less than that. One thing that should be understood is the safety mechanism which prevents steam from building up pressure unless the cover is closed completely as it should be. There is a cylindrical metal plug in a hole in the handle which gets pushed up by steam pressure (not talking about the central steam vent pipe capped by a heavy wobbling rocker). If the lid is not closed properly, an ingeniously designed sliding flange in the handle prevents the cylindrical plug from rising up to close the hole completely, therefore allowing steam to continuously vent out of the unsealed hole. This prevents a dangerous explosion of a loose lid. The first time I used the cooker, I did not realize that a bowl which I had placed inside to contain the rice was preventing the sliding flange from allowing the cylindrical plug to rise. When I finally realized how the flange was supposed to work, I moved the interior bowl away from the locking mechanism (after everything had cooled down, of course) and then everything worked fine. If you feel some resistance in closing the lid, don't force anything. Make sure the sliding flange is not preventing the cylindrical plug from rising. Once you see this, you will understand it without so many words.I especially enjoy the cheerful action of the central rocker (pressure regulator) when pressure builds up and steam begins to sputter out of the central vent pipe. The heavy rocker wobbles merrily reminding me of an old fashioned steam locomotive chugging along. This action informs me how much I can turn the heat down to keep on cooking without wasting water or energy.",positive
It helps save energy and it will last a lifetime.  Great product to have in the kitchen for cooking.  Simple to use and fantastic.,positive
"Much safer than the traditional ones we grew up with, great size and useful recipe book enclosed for time comparisons.",positive
"I bought this cooker 6 months ago from amazon for $35, and frankly, although the reviews I read on this product all said that it's great, I was very skeptical about the $35 price tag and was not expecting much.  On top of that, both my mother and my mother-in-law warned me that cheap pressure cookers are dangerous, and I *must* buy something more expensive for safety reasons. I am just very glad that they were both wrong!This is definitely one of the best purchases I have made on amazon. I still cannot believe they sell this for $35! The pot does not feel cheap at all. It has very sturdy handles, and a thick, heavy bottom, which holds in heat well.  I like this pan so much that sometimes I use it instead of my skillet to sautee meat, because of the deeper pot + the cover, less cleaning up for me :-)I love making soup and stock, but it usually takes up so much of my time when the stock is simmering.  With this pressure cooker, I can make a meat-fall-off-the-bone soup in an hour!Some might find this pot to be a little on the small side, but this pot works great for my wife and I. Although we have guests over regularly, I find the capacity of the pot to be very good. I would guess that this pot would work well for up to a 4-person family.Pros:=====- Cheap, at $35, it's hard to beat- Sturdy, I was afraid that the plastic handles would break easily, but they are in fact quite strong- Stainless steel makes it great for browning meat pieces for stew or stock, and it heats up fast and holds heat well.- Safe, you cannot open it when it's pressurized.- Dish washer safe, though I prefer to wash it by hand.Cons:=====- The handle can be tricky to hold with one hand. My hands are small, and when you've closed the top, the handle is kind of big. Luckily, I don't need to do this very often, and when I need to move it around, I just use both handles.- The top cap can be tricky to clean. I usually soak it in hot soapy water, and then clean it thoroughly with Q-tip.Watch outs:===========- The handle curves in a way that it catches any dripping liquid, I've hurt myself once when I wasn't careful at opening the cover.- Do *NOT* remove the cap while it's blowing! The steam from inside is extremely hot and as soon as you remove the cap, the hot steam will shoot up faster than you can move your hand(s) away.Tips:=====- I keep some water bottles in my freezer, and when I need to cool this off in a hurry, I can make a bath of cold water in my sink, put the hot pot inside, and throw the froze water bottles in. This usually cools it down very fast, great when I want to refrigerate it overnight to skim off the fat, and didn't want to wait too long for it to cool down.",positive
"I have long been familiar with the Presto brand.  Presto Pressure Cookers have been used in my family for many many years.  I have to admit that I was a bit afraid of them due to some urban legends being passed around, but I decided to try this one.  It is amazing.  After the first use, I was totally sold!!!  It is easy to use and the directions are very clear and easy to understand.  This one is foolproof and safe.",positive
"Funny story, because my mom was used one before and blows up. So when I got first time try it out I was hide in the backyard until the trimmer running then I m relax. It's good one I love it. Shorter my cooking time and pretty good meterio.",positive
"If the handles fit tighter without wobbling I'd love it but you cant complain too much for the $25 or so I paid. Good things are its not too big, the lid goes on real smooth, the safely lock mechanism is a neat idea. Points to note: plastic handles need good tightening and seem to be wobbly from the get go, when you put the lid on move it too and fro so the safety plug that locks the handle is centered in the hole and free to move, lastly keep the flame low enough so it doesnt hit the handles as they will start to make a bad smell. Not sure if that's just a &#34;first time&#34; thing or if the plastic really cant tolerate exposure to much heat but it works fine with a safe flame level so it's not an issue just a thing to be aware of.",positive
"I've looked and checked out many other pressure cookers before buying this one. From the costly ones in department stores to others online. Department stores prices were to high and I couldn't get any product information from the sales people I would talk with. After reading the reviews here I decided to purchase the Presto. Best choice I've made. The arrival was within a few days. The Cooker is great looking after using it for four different meals. We have enjoyed a delicious pot roast, chicken with veggies, and a hard to cook oxtail stew. There was no problem with reading the directions on how to use. I did it without my husband my assistance. (he's better with gagets). I am planning on using it at least once a week for hardy winter meals.",positive
"We are living at 6,000 feet elevation, and this pressure cooker has made cooking dried beans and grains a snap.  The delivery was prompt, packaging excellent, and product quality also excellent.  Wouldn't want to do without it now.",positive
"This is a great addition to my kitchen.  It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal.  I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and 4-qt also. Now I use these 3 cookers for everything.  I am happy about ""stainless steel"" because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it). This is a well-made, top of the line product for such a great price.  Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while.  Other than that, I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others.",positive
"This pressure cooker is great. I would definitely recommend using this to speed up crockpot recipes. In fact, we used this pressure cooker twice to make a corned beef brisket and agreed that it came out even better than using the crockpot.",positive
"I had to replace an ancient pressure cooker that was passed down to me many years ago.  This one is much smaller but, since I don't do any canning and only cook for three people, it is the perfect size for me.  With all the warnings now about the dangers of too much aluminum in our diets, I love that it is stainless steel.  It will make the toughest cut of meat so tender that it falls apart.",positive
Magic!  I don't know why I haven't used a pressure cooker before.  You can make lentil soup in like 10 minutes.  It's amazing.  And this one is nice and sturdy and easy to use.,positive
I was thrilled to discover that the stainless steel model that I purchased would work with my induction cook top.  Tried it out and it worked great!,positive
"Of my 25 year old pressure cooker, the exact same brand and style, anything that you can use for 25 years is an amazing product!",positive
I use this all the time I wouldn't want to be without it.Cooks fast & would buy again,positive
"It's been several months since I've purchased the Presto 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker, and I have to admit that this cooker packs some seriously power!  Having a pressure cooker speeds up cooking so much - I've been able to make a lot of Chinese Soups in a fraction of the time it takes to make normally!  This pot is especially good when cooking soups with proteins, particularly beans and meat.  Because it cooks so quickly, we're not only enjoying dinner faster, but saving a lot of energy to boot!  Highly recommended!",positive
"As a child I was scared to death of my mom's pressure cooker and swore I'd never have one.  But this one is very  nice.  There are two ways to cook with it after the little toggle starts rocking you are instructed to (1) put the pot under water and it cools down all at once, or (2) let it cool down on its own.  If you are instructed to let it cool down on its own, it can take up to 30 minutes to cool down. I thought cooking with this would be a lot quicker; but that aside, it is a great way to have something that really does cook in a fraction of the time it normally takes to cook something; but it is not a &#34;microwave&#34; quick type of instrument.",positive
The only thing I would add to this pot would be a temperature indicater. I would build it right into the pressure cap so I would be able to set up an optimum temperature.,positive
"At the price, it must cut some corners, right? Not so! Presto has been making these things for a long time and it shows. This is the ""old-fashioned"" design with the rocker on top, but it's very quiet compared with older models and needs only a very modest heat to keep pressure up. The build quality seems great and the pressure interlock (that prevents the top being removed under pressure) is simple and works fine.In short, you can spend several times as much and not get much of value for the additional investment. Works perfectly, easy to clean, and replacement parts are widely available if needed. I wish Presto sold it in a kit with the glass cover and vegetable basket, but...it gets an easy five stars anyway. No regrets and I feel all warm and fuzzy over the money I saved.A note: This type of cooker does not have an instant pressure relief valve, so you'll have to run cold water over it if you need to release pressure quickly -- for instance, with some vegetables. Not a big deal IMO, but if it bothers you, you'll need to spend two or three times as much. I can't see the point.",positive
"I've been using Pressure Cookers for years, and was under the assumption that ""size does matter""...  Well, guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things, I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them, but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!",positive
"My mom brought a pressure cooker from Brasil 15 years ago, and on our last trip she was not able to find replacement rubber gaskets for it. I talked her into replacing it for something new, shiny and fancy. The quality is there, and the locking mechanism is STRONG. It's not a latch on the handle like a traditional pressure cooker. This unit has slots all around the pan that link up to the lid, and you rotate the lid to seal the unit. That means there's more than 8 latches on the pan. Those beans aren't getting out any time soon.",positive
"Some people have dinged this product because it is small.  It is exactly as described, four quart. I wanted a smaller pot for making smaller batches.  It works perfectly.  I like the heavy gauge body.  The seal feels very secure.  The only thing that is a bit flimsy is the pressure regulator.  I will see how it holds up.",positive
I had this in my wishlist & received it for Christmas.  I've used it several times & I love it.  Its smaller than the one I had previously but that is perfect for us.  Only 3 at home anymore.I love that this is made of stainless steel.  The insert is still made of aluminum which Im not thrilled about but I dont have to use it if I dont want to.This pressure cooker is also a lot quieter than my old one is.  I appreciate that a LOT!Its a great product and Im so happy to have it.,positive
"The handle for the pot is secured with only one screw. The handle itself is curved to fit against the pot, but the directions emphasize multiple times that you shouldn't overtighten to avoid cracking the plastic.  I tightened it reasonably and when the pot is full and it's tilted to pour out the contents (boiling water for example), the handle wobbles/turns slightly.  I can easily see this becoming a hazard with continued use/failure to retighten regularly.  Fortunately, Amazon was willing to accept the return.  The company could resolve this problem by using metal on the edge of the handle piece, selling their pots pre-assembled in a more sturdy manner, or hey- bright idea- USING TWO FASTENERS LIKE EVERY OTHER POT MANUFACTURER.  Hmm.",positive
"Before purchasing this pressure cooker, I went to Macy's and bought an aluminum pressure cooker because it was on sale.  Got it home and tried it out.  After cooking my meal, I noticed the inside of the pressure cooker had become terribly discolored. I did not want my family eating out of that pressure cooker.  So I immediately took it back.  I purchased the Presto 6-qt. pressure cooker and I do love it.  It is stainless steel, easy clean-up and no discoloration.  I should have known better because I had a Presto for over 25 years.  The rocker on my old one wore out and I knew it was time to get another.  If you're looking to replace an older model or just plain looking for a new pressure cooker, you won't be disappointed with this one.",positive
Exactly what I was expecting.  I used this as a Christmas gift and the recipient couldn't have been more pleased.  A great buy for the cost.,positive
"This purchase was one of the first times that Amazon reviews let me down. As others have recently stated, it seems Presto has changed manufacturing of the screws, making the handles of this pressure cooker unsteady...no matter how many times I tighten the screws, and how tight I, or my husband, try to get them, they loosen and the handles become very wobbly. This is not just a problem with one handle, but both handles! I tried this item for a week, which required retightening the handles about a dozen times, and I have given up.Additionally, after only two washes, the screws are already starting to rust! I didn't wash it in the dishwasher, it was by hand.I can understand why this is an inexpensive product...it is cheaply made! However, I am baffled at why it gets such good reviews.",positive
"One upon a time, many years ago.. I had a very bad experience with a pressure cooker. I swore at that time to never let one in my house again. Well, time passed and my patience with cooking grew more thin. With the children grown and free time in the evenings at a premium due to work, I decided it was time to have another go at a pressure cooker.I am very glad I did. Beef and pork roast as well as turkey breast have been brought forth in no time at all. Potatoes cooked to perfection in short minutes.My biggest probem is where to keep it so it is handy at all times!I highly recommend this item. Once I finally pulled it warily from its boxand sealed it for its first trial in my home, I was hooked. Evey home should  have one!",positive
"Replacing one I wore out with the exact same one!  I tried another, it did not work well and is &#34;leaky&#34; so went ahead and bit the bullet to purchase this one.  Have used several times and I must say I am not disappointed in my decision!  I use this item at least 1-2 times a week.",positive
"My hubby and I bought this pressure cooker last year for our first experimental use with a pressure cooker. We were unsure of what exactly we were doing but this pressure cooker was pretty self-explanitory. It doesn't open if the steam is too hot which is great, because it definately avoids accidents (something we were a bit worried about).So far this pressure-cooker seems to be super heavy-duty. We've used it to can salmon fish and every single can came out sealed to perfection. We were SO pleased! We've also used it for ribs and potatoes and they are soo good. We've turned tough peices of reindeer meat into butter with this thing. It's really perfect and I couldn't have asked for a better beginner kitchen accessory.A few tips:To clean the pressure hole on the top of the lid pour boiling water through.Boil the weight to get sticky grime out.Oil the seal with vegetable oil every month or so to keep it sticky and let it last longer.To close the lid hold the handle and then level out the side with your hand while placing it on top- it definately helped us get it on correctly.",positive
"I bought this one to replace a weight-less pressure pot. That one has an issue of leaking steam and hence does not work.This cooker is lightweight, but works very well.",positive
this is a wonderful cooker.  The size is great for 2 or 3 people but I would get a larger one for more people.  Everything comes out tasty and the meat are tender in such a short time.  The only problems I had were in the beginning.  I thought you needed to keep the pressure regulator jiggling to cook the food but if you do that the heat is too high and it burns the food so turn the heat down once it starts jiggling.  Also be careful when you wash the lid.  If the pressure plug gets caught the steam escapes and you think the cookers not working and the food will burn because you cook it too long or have the heat up too high.,positive
"I am so pleased with my purchase of the Presto 01362 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker.  For shorter cooking times, pressure cooking is certainly the way to go for beans and grains.  I am totally in love with this cooker.  Simple to use and a good looking cooking tool.",positive
"I've owned several pressure cookers over the years.  This one is my current favorite for several reasons.  First, I like the 4-qt. size.  It's the smallest pressure cooker I own and perfect for cooking for one or two people.  Next, I'm happy with the  quality of the product.  It's hefty enough to feel substantial, yet not so heavy that it's difficult to use and clean.  The  stainless steel seems to be of very good quality--I've  had no problem cleaning it.  Last, this pressure cooker seems to cook  faster than my Fagor 6-qt. model.  I don't know if it's a difference in the pressure cooker or because I'm cooking less food in this one, but I like the speed.  I don't find this pressure cooker particularly noisy--I turn down the heat once pressure is obtained.  I have nothing negative to say about this product--I'd buy it again.",positive
It cooks quick and is easy to clean. I have had several pressure cookers over many years and this one rates up there with the best.,positive
"The so-called ""cooking times"" seem short and very fast, but they don't take into account the time it takes to build up the pressure, which is often longer than the actual stated cooking times.  For example, to cook potatoes the time is given as 8 minutes, but it takes 10 minutes to build up the full pressure before you're to start timing, so it's really 18 minutes.  Plan accordingly.  It's even worse for recipes done in parts where you cool it down to add a second step or things that would over cook if added at the beginning - then you have to build to pressure twice.The cooking rack at the botton is nice, but no easy way to extract it when it's hot, or thicken gravy, so you have to empty it, reclaim the juice, thicken that, and add back the main dish and stir on low heat.Since you can't fill the thing more than half way or three fourths to the top (for safety) I sort of wish I got the 8 quart one so a entire cut up chicken and vegetables wouldn't be pushing the limit.Still, it's easy to clean up and use.",positive
"Sturdy, well made, now has a heat-difusing plate on the bottom. You need a good arm to lift this cooker whether it's full or empty as there's a lot of steel there. Ours has lasted for years now. Yes they're outsourced from Wisconsin to China - but someone is staying on top of the process and this is still a good product.",positive
"I have not used this yet, but other than that...the quality of the cooker is awesome---not cheap!All I need to do is just learn to use the pressure part of it...I will most likely need to get a cook book for pressure cooking.I actually bought this for two reasons--to cook meals quicker and using less electricity.Hopefully I can come back to post how the pressure part works.",positive
"Full size thick heat disk on bottom for even heat distribution, heat retention (for searing) and efficiency. Easy to use. Nice straight up sides (easy clean up, no scorching, and even heat from disk rather than heat caught going up around sides), well constructed and handles can be re-tightened. Handles don't get hot. Capacity lines are a part of the steel so they won't rub off, and aren't indented or stamped (many come with no lines or cheaply printed lines). The most dishwasher safe pressure cooker I've looked into (though I don't have a DW and wouldn't bother to use one). The fairly wide base was not too wide, and worked fine for cooking a single serving of rice (1/2 cup dry rice). I feel totally safe using it with all it's safety features.Though it's not billed as a quick release PC or commonly reviewed as one; you can fairly safely lift the weight off with a silicon mit (safer I dare say than I've seen some that are considered quick release). I'd even dare to do it bare handed as the metal under it is hot (don't touch), but the plastic part of it hasn't gotten too hot to touch. I have the fingers of a professional cook and have touched the metal part w/o getting burned, but it is freaking hot. It's not like the handles get too hot to carry it to the sink anyway (if it's available).No electric / computer parts to fail and leave you with a pile of junk (this should last a lifetime aside from some affordable replacement parts like gasket and safety plug). Higher pressure than electric models. No toxic Teflon or shady/ reactive aluminum. Not dependent on electricity or any particular heat source: you could use candles, camp fire, solar, induction, etc.I like that I can hear how it's doing from my living room without it making annoying sounds. If it's clanking: I know to turn the heat down.Any improvements that could be made to it I think would be personal preferences; like some might contend that the handle is too long restricting storage space.",positive
This is a gift item and it is perfect for the Christmas present recipient. It is the right size for use and for storage.,positive
"I've owned a Presto pressure cooker for many years and have been very satisfied with it.  I purchased this one for my brother, who loves to cook and loves new gadgetry.  Mission accomplished: we're both very happy with our purchase.  Just a note, when considering pressure cookers, look for stainless steel.  It cooks better, cleans better, feels more secure.",positive
"This seems to be a high quality product at a very reasonable price.  It cooks less expensive cuts of beef (stew meat, chuck roast, corned beef) to mouth watering tenderness in a fraction of the time required in either an oven or slow cooker.  It quickly cooks two or three pounds of chicken for salads, sandwiches, or freezing.  Cook a pork roast with your favorite barbeque sauce in 30-45 minutes and enjoy pulled pork sandwiches infused with the flavor of the sauce.  This would be a great tool for the cook who likes make- ahead meals and stocking the freezer for quick-reheating weekday dinners.  Get the stainless steel model to avoid the reaction of aluminum to acidic foods.  Eventually you will be glad you did.The clad base is very heavy so I wouldn't recommend using the pan for pasta or vegetables but if you have strong wrists and arms you could do this.  Other lids are available from Presto.",positive
"all the reviews are really good which led my purchase. after three uses, i found the quality is not any superior than my previous pressure cooker. i give a four star rating for its quality and three star for its price.",positive
"My wife is from Brazil, so she is a foremost authority on pressure cookers as they use them there for almost every meal daily.Originally I tried the very cheap aluminum alternative for $15 on sale at Sears, and it failed after one use.This is better than the ones that last 20 years in Brazil. It's efficient, it's durable, it's just plain a good product, and you really shouldn't pay more for a pressure cooker than $40-$50 as it's a very simple item.",positive
"Works great. We love the Stainless Steel pressure cooker, instead of the aluminum pressure cookers that are apt to leave contaminates in your food.",positive
this is by far the best product for a family of two. We enjoy the ease of use and easy clean up.,positive
"This is a very basic, high quality pressure cooker. There are no &#34;frills&#34; (does such a thing exist on such a utilitarian appliance?), but it will suit your needs perfectly. It is large, and can fully cook beans in 20 minutes instead of 2 days. I use it weekly.",positive
"This is a simple but good pressure cooker.  I have owned the same model for several years.  You have to be attentive when you use them, but they work great and make a great quick homecooked meal - think of it as the opposite of a slow cooker/crock pot.  I bought this one for my daughter and gave her a few &#34;cooking lessons&#34; with it.  No disappointments here.",positive
This is a heavy gauge stainless steel pot!  The gaskets are thick and sturdy.  It has a lid locking mechanism that is a great safety feature!  It is a roomy 6 quart pot.  I highly recommend this pressure cooker!,positive
Love the Presto brand Pressure cooker. I owned another one for many years--it eventually had to be retired. My daughter replaced it with a TFal brand pressure cooker which neither one of us was happy with. So I bought this Presto Pressure Cooker. Love it. I think my daughter learned not to buy any other brand of pressure cooker but a Presto.,positive
"Easy to use, manual easy to understand and assemble and cooks super fast.I followed the guidelines for cooking dry beans and noticed that they can use a couple more minutes more of cooking than the cooking book suggests, just make sure you have plenty of stock or water or it will burn the bottom. The only down part is that you can;t see through the lid to notice if you are running low of liquid :(",positive
"I had a Presto 6QT pressure cooker that was stolen by a Bimbo.  I got an 8QT foreign made pressure cooker but I liked the Presto, missed it and decided to get another one.  The old one was American made and the Stainless Steel at the top seemed to be a bit heavier.  This one  has a heavier bottom due to the sandwiched in clad aluminum.  The one Drawback is that it is Made in Communist China.  It seems to be pretty stout overall.  I can't detect any difference in the way that it cooks.",positive
"This is an investment every house cook should make. The meats come out super duper tender and it takes no time at all. 10 min and your chicken for soup or any dish is ready! The top is very very sturdy so do not worry about it coming off or exploding while under pressure. I love my pressure cooker and this smaller size is perfect for my husband and I since it's just the two of us. And remember to always get STAINLESS STEEL. Aluminium eventually peels off and isn't as durable, plus it's toxic for you. Oh, and cleaning is a snap!!! Dishwasher safe and even is  you do it by hand, nothing sticks :) good purchase",positive
"Well engineered, inexpensive, SAFE, does the job.  What more can you say?  Replaced an old Presto pressure cooker that served over 30 years before the handle broke.  I expect comparable lifespan for this one.  Steer clear of the cheap Mantra pressure cookers sold in Target.  Those ones are dangerous and are not UL approved!",positive
"I bought this to quickly make stocks, and cook soups and vegetables.  It really does work, and makes yum-yum foods quickly, when one doesn't have the time to spend 3 hours making foods.  I'm impressed by the quality of the stainless steel, particularly the bottom, which is pretty thick.  I don't see any downsides to owning one.",positive
"Gas and electricity has gone up so much lately. Pressure cookers can help you save by making cooking a lot much faster.  It comes with a compact user guide and a small cookbook.Pressure cookers can be dangerous, so make sure to read the safety precautions. Never fill it more than 2/3 of its capacity. You cannot open the lid while it is still pressurized with the built-in precautionary lock, but the rocker valve can easily get toppled and extremely hot steam can escape through it.Pros:- Stainless steel. You do not want aluminum for health reasons.- We have been using this for more than 5 years.  We just have to replace the rubber gasket around the lid.- Although not as cheap as we like it to be, if you compare it to other manufacturers, you still save some money.Cons:- The pressure valve rocker. Other pressure cookers (but more expensive) has a  non-removable pressure valve.  It is often get misplaced.- The rocker makes quite a bit noise.",positive
"Am a strong believer in pressure cookers and have used them for many years. Have always used foreign made cookers because years ago they were better quality than the American made cookers. Have a Magefesa and several Fagors and started having quality and service problems with them (see my review under Fagor's 6qt. Splendid model). Finally, in desperation, decided to try a new American made Presto since they were now made of Stainless steel and had good ratings with Amazon. Got one on sale from Amazon with free shipping and received it lickety-split in great shape (thanks Amazon). Read the user's guide which walked me through an easy assembly and proceeded to cook a pot of beans. Wow! Such simplicity and everything worked great. Straight forward simplicity and as well engineered as one could ever expect and as a bonus, much easier to clean. Can't see what could possibly go wrong. One more thing that I was highly impressed with is the users guide for the Presto; it is super clear and easy to understand with nothing left to chance. Kudos to current American products for a now great cooker. If you like pressure cookers, give the Presto a try!!!",positive
"This is an excellent Pressure Cooker.  It works perfect on my Induction Cooker.  This is my second Presto Pressure cooker, the first one had wooden handles, and was made of aluminum (still in service).  Aluminum not being compatible with Induction Cooking I got the Stainless Steel.  The encapsulated bottom creates that perfect heat distribution for searing and browning.  What an absolutely beautiful combination.  The new sealing ring is a wonder all by its self when compared to the ones of the 1940's.  Do I sound happy with this cooker, That's because I am.  The first thing I cooked was a pot of Pinto beans,(see photo) the pressure cooker cooked them 14 times faster than a conventional pan.  Clean up is a breeze, and to keep that just out of the box look I use Bar Keepers Friend. During assembling, use caution when attaching the handle to the lid as I twisted off one of the screws, which is not a problem or deterrent as Presto has great customer service, and sent a complete new replacement assembly.  I shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future.  Thanks to Amazon.com for a fantastic buy.  All Pros and No Cons.  This review was written assuming the reader knows a little bit about Pressure Cooking.  Pressure Cooking is Fast, Fun, and Flavorful.  :)",positive
"Get the Presto. They're all the same. It's a simple design, a pot and lid. I've been using them for 20 years and the expensive ones are no better than the Presto- Only an amateur cook would believe different. The Prestos cook just as good and just as fast as the Rikons. My kitchen is filled with the best and most expensive equipment money can buy, but when it comes to pressure cookers, it's not like other cookware where you ""get what you pay for.""  They're all the same (although I don't recommend the electric ones as they have a tendency to break down). Save your money for the good espresso maker... don't waste it on expensive pressure cookers. Get the Presto.",positive
"Oh,how I wish I hadn't waited so long to try Pressure Cooking!  My mother instilled so much fear in me about using a pressure cooker that I didn't even want to try it until a friend finally convinced me.  Now I'd absolutely hate to be without this fast and safe way to cook.My first experiment was a recipe for Chicken Cacciatore.  Three pounds of chicken cooked for 10 minutes (at 6000' altitude) and was fork-tender and delicious.  My next endeavor was a ham and bean soup, which cooked for 35 minutes without having to presoak the beans, and it turned out perfectly. Beans were completely cooked but not mushy.  Next came a pot roast with potatoes, which cooked for 45 minutes starting partially frozen, and was perfect.  Then tried a chicken with plum sauce--again a nine-minute success.  Most recently we tried pasta with meat sauce, which was a delicious one-pot meal ready in 7 minutes cooking time.I love this Presto model cooker, because it has all the safety features, but still allows careful monitoring of the""jiggle top"", and allows me to judge how fast the dish is cooking. This is a heavy and well-built unit. The safety precautions are easy, and are fully described in the accompanying manual.I also recommmend Lorna Sass' book ""Pressure Perfect"", for beginners.  This book is a well-written primer on pressure cooking, with recipes that are reliable and carefully written.  The recipes have a degree of creativity, but are all things that ""real people"" eat.Happy cooking!",positive
Good cooker but I had trouble handling it with my severe arthritis in my wrists- just too heavy for me to handle with food in it.  Cleans up easily & love the fact it is stainless steel.,positive
"This is an excellent pressure cooker. I also have the 8-quart stainless steel model by Presto and I don't like that one as much as this one. I like the little rocker on top better because I know exactly how much pressure it has. It is super easy to carry this extremely lightweight pressure cooker to the sink, run water over it, and in 5-10 seconds the pressure is down! It is not heavy or hot. You just have to be careful when you do this. I actually prefer this method of quick cooling to the method used in the 8-quart, which is to open the little weight and let the steam shoot out the top. That method takes about a minute, plus there's steam all over the place. That seems more dangerous to me than going to the sink.This model is a smaller version of the 6-quart, so if you think this one is too small, that one would work for a family. This size is just right for one or two people. I always make very small quantities of food in it anyway as I don't like to have a lot of leftovers.Cleanup with this product is very fast and easy as it is so lightweight. Another nice thing is that replacement parts are very easy to obtain (rubber gasket and overpressure plug).I highly recommend this pressure cooker and the 6-quart stainless steel model as well.",positive
"Reviewed many pressure cookers before deciding on this one.  While it requires a bit of assembly (handles and valve) these are minor issues.  Very well made cooker and the 64 page booklet included useful information and recipes.  Bought the 4 quart model since use for one person most of the time.  Not having used pressure cooker before appreciated the warnings and useful tips on how to use safely.  Like the fact that Presto has replacement seals when needed.  Obviously cooker is useless if do not have this seal and in time am sure will require replacement.  Buying one for my daughter as well who is busy career woman and wants to eat healthy and quickly.  Keeping nutrients and vitamins in the food a plus as is the savings in time cooking a good meal.  Easy to recommend this item.The instruction book that comes with this cooker is probably one of the best I have read in recent years.  At the same time it is also very detailed in the care, maintenance and handling of the cooker.  For example, it recommends replacing the seal and the safety plug once every two years.  Of course that probably depends on the amount of use and the care you take of the product.  In any case recommends replacing the safety plug when you replace the seal.  Both are available on Amazon but this will mean a continuing cost to use the product. At the moment using Amazon Prime cost is about $15 for the pair of items or roughly $7.50 a year if replace every two years. I do highly recommend anyone wanting to use the product to read the instructions very carefully and perhaps highlight the key items.  For example what foods to cook and more important what foods not to cook.  What level in the pot to use for various items depending on their expansion during cooking.  Also you need to look through the hole for the safety plug to be sure it is clear and use pipe cleaners to clean that hole and also the hole through the nut, all explained very clearly in the instructions.  Various tips on how to clean (and how not to clean) the pot are very useful.  If you have induction stove you will need the stainless steel pot since the aluminum pots are not magnetic, but then you probably knew that.Today with so many instructions written in China often they are difficult to read or not very worthwhile.  The instructions with this cooker are quite different. They are important to use the product safely and to get the most value out of the product.  If you are someone who seldom reads instructions or is not willing to spend an hour or so learning about this cooking method or who will not take the time to follow the safety instructions then you probably should consider a different method of cooking.  But an hour or so spent learning about he product will pay off in better cooking, shorter time spent cooking and more healthy eating. I ordered a second cooker for my busy career oriented daughter but then cancelled the order after reading the instructions as I am not sure as busy as she is that she would read and follow them.  I plan to show her mine and see if she will spend the time to learn the system.  If so will order again for her.  Or give her mine and buy second for myself. To me it is worth spending the time to learn about safely using this product but I can see that it is not for everyone.  It is not a pot you just pour water into, stick lid on and fire up the burners.  But once you learn how to take care of it and use it I think you will be extremely pleased with the cooking experience. And the time spent learning and caring for the cooker will pay off in shorter and better cooking.  For those willing to invest a little time, bon appetite!",positive
"As many folks out there, including Anthony Bourdain I too was scared of pressure cookers. After I purchased this my first one I made sure to study the entire manual, as if for a school test. The rocker type is really totally harmless! Cooking times are slashed by at least two thirds, less gas and therefor less escaped heat and better inefficiency make this cooking method a winner. Cleanup is also very quick. The heavy base and material compound allows for some nice browning of meat, which is essential for good flavor. Anne Burrell always says:&#34;Brown Food tastes Good&#34;.",positive
This pressure cooker works great.  The rubber gasket and stopper can't go in the dishwasher but the other parts can.  I use this to make beans about twice a week and it produces a result much better than when I was boiling them before.This is also pretty big - would recommend looking at an equivalent sized vessel in person before purchasing.  I also like that's it's stainless steel as opposed to aluminum.,positive
"I ordered the Presto Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker, I have nothing bad to say about the product or about Amazon.  I got my order pretty much on time...1 day late with free shipping.  I've ordered from Presto before with no complaints or with Amazon at this time.Mookie in Chicago",positive
My husband & I live in a small apartment & enjoy this handy kitchen aid for its small size & good results!  We attempt to cook the majority of our meals & this pressure cooker helps us eat well & produces wonderful meals!,positive
"My good friend was longing for a pressure cooker, so I thought I would surprise her with an early birthday present.  She says she really likes it.  It is nice looking and has the same footprint as the 4 qt. cooker (which is nice in a small kitchen).  She brought some beans she made in it to a cookout, and they were delicious.  I think it is a good value for the price.",positive
"I have always been afraid of pressure cookers because as a child my mother always banned me from the kitchen when she was using one. Well, twenty some odd years later I finally purchased this one.  I read the instruction booklet and the first night made mashed potatoes and a pot roast.  Wow!  My 12 year old son loved the meal and said these mashed potatoes were the best he ever ate and the meat was so tender.  It was so easy to use and easy to clean.  I am already planning on making BBQ pork ribs next!  Whoo-Hoo! Buy it! Use it!....but read the instructions first! Enjoy:-)",positive
"Only thing that surprised me was that I had to put peas and lintels in a pot, inside of the pot.I bought a 10 dollar pot to fit inside and now I can dal with the best of them.",positive
"My mother bought me this nearly exact cooker many years ago, and it got lost in a move about 5 years ago. I just now replaced it. I had used my old one for about 7 years and it was fine. No problems with my old one with the stainless steel either.I got this NEW one today, and washed it and peeled about 3-4 lbs potatoes and sliced 3/4 in thick, and added 2 cups water, two tbsp dried onion flakes, pepper, and garlic powder. 16 minutes later, drained the water off and used my handy dandy mixer and had the best creamiest fluffiest mashed potatoes ever. I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT ALONG WITHOUT IT THESE PAST FIVE YEARS!!  I CAN'T WAIT TO USE IT OFTEN!!THE BOTTOM LINE:Inexpensive,functions very well,looks nice,parts easy to order, (Walmart sells parts for it I heard)easy to clean,has two handles,AAA+++ for price and function.eta: I HAVE NOW HAD THIS PRESSURE COOKER FOR ALMOST 6 YEARS, IT IS STILL LIKE NEW, WORKS GREAT, NO PROBLEMS, I USE IT TWO TO THREE TIMES A WEEK. IT WAS AND STILL IS A GREAT COOKER. I COULD NOT GET ALONG WITHOUT IT.",positive
"I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.  My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet), the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that, unlike my 8 qt., this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve, so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the ""jiggler"" steam valve is reminiscent of much older models, Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority.",positive
"I've owned and used a 4 quart pressure cooker for 38 years and have been delighted that parts are still easy to get for it.  So when I decided that I needed increased cooking capacity, I was happy to see that the current models are similar to the one that I bought in 1974.The cooker is pretty much what you need to cook with little more, no basket you might find convenient for jars used for canning.  Other models specifically for canning have this.  It is, however, well designed for cooking and the design well executed.  The handles (there are three) are not attached but are easily assembled using 5 phillips screws.  I used some heat resistant anti-seize compound sparingly on the threads.  The same as I use on the spark plugs in my car.  The handles on my old 4 quart cooker are slightly loose but the screws are hopelessly seized, despite being made from stainless steel.The handle and helper handle on the opposing side is just right for managing it on the range.  The low aluminum rack, called a trivet, has not changed at all, it allows the food to sit above the water in the bottom and prevents it from burning. The pressure regulator has changed little and the over-pressure emergency relief plug is the same, except that the poppet valve is now incorporated with the lid pressure interlock.  The poppet valve allows steam to escape until the rate is high enough to close the valve and seal the cooker allowing the pressure to begin building.  The lid interlock prevents the lid from being opened when the pot is pressurized.  This strikes me as a redundant feature since it is almost impossible to open the lid when even it is under even a small amount of pressure, but I guess someone has done it.  Consequently, with the safety interlock, closing the lid must be done with a little more care than on my old cooker which did not have it.  It just takes a little more attention to alignment.  The lid sealing ring is thinner, but is actually easier to grease and install in the lid.  Finally, the gauge of the stainless steal is exactly as thick as my older 4 quart cooker although it appears thinner.  The sides, lid, and bottom of the older models are uniform thickness and are heavy enough to spread heat evenly.  This cooker now has a layer of aluminum to help spread the heat evenly across the bottom of the pot.  This layer is clad in stainless steel, so all exposed surfaces, most importantly, the bottom, are stainless steel.  The pot and lid are highly polished, but the bar code sticker was a little difficult to get off the side.  There are indented markings at the levels of 1/2 and 2/3 capacity which are visible on the inside and outside of the pot, a nice addition.The inside dimensions are 8 1/2 inches in diameter and 6 1/4 inches deep same diameter as my 4 quart and about 2 1/4 inches deeper.I cooked a 15 lbs pumpkin using it an my old 4 quart in parallel (cooking several pots in each cooker) and I'm with happy with the results.  Despite the extra complication of the lid interlock it proved easy to operate and the thinner seal seems less likely to leak as sometime happens with the older cooker.While I was a little put off by the lighter-looking gauge metal (actually the same thicknes) and leery of the complication of the lid-interlock, after using it I was very pleased to see that Presto is still maintaining excellence in design and construction of a classic cooking utensil whose basic utility is often overlooked in today's gadget filled kitchen.  I can do things with a pressure cooker which cannot be done with a microwave!",positive
"I bought this pressure cooker to make chili. I've never owned or used a pressure cooker and was a bit nervous when I fired it up for the 1st time. It heat up real quick using a ceramic glass cook top, and I was to able to brown the meat realitively quick. The contruction of this pressure cooker looks very high quality and well made. The only thing I wanna add is be very careful with when to lower the heat and when to move the steam controlling top on the top. You can lower the heat as soon as you see steam coming out of the bottom of steam controlling top, and be very careful not to touch the top until the nipple on the handle drops down, indicating that there's no pressure in the cooker. Good investment!",positive
"This pressure cooker is easy to use and maintains the quality of the end product better than convential cooking ...You not only gain the benefit of ""speed"" (about 1/3 the cooking time of convential cooking time) but little or nothing is lostas far as flavor and seasoning ... I think anyone who desires to cook should have a pressure cooker and this is a verygood one ... RPH",positive
"I received this a few days ago from Amazon.  This is a great pressure cooker and the size of 4 Quarts is ideal for me.  I made beef stew (cuban style) which is stew beef and potatoes with olives.  It came great and this 4 Quarts is big enough  for this recipe, with gravy and everything.  I was right by purchasing this Presto.  This is a great product for its quality and price.  Extremely happy with this purchase.  Highly recommended.",positive
Got this cooker about a month ago haven't stopped useing it yet don't know how I got along without it for so long... glad i didn't get an electric one I saw on QVC.,positive
I use pressure cookers a lot and I was leary of the new designs with no pressure dial but find this product excellent and easy to use.  The pot comes up to pressure quickly.  It could use an improved booklet that is better organized (I end up using my old booklet most of the time) but the pot is good for cooking in general as well as the pressure cooking aspect. It works on my induction cooktop well also.,positive
"Does everything a pressure cooker should do.  A little delicate if bumped, and a little hard to clean,  but otherwise good.",positive
"My Mom always told me horror stories about pressure cooker, but I really wanted one after listening to my friend's successful experience with it. I got this 4-quart one several weeks ago, and I am super happy with it!!  I have been pulling an entire beef top round and pork shoulder straight out of FREEZER to cook in pressure cooker, and I was able to serve dinner in an hour.  It's perfect for a poor planner like me.I did read the manual over and over to make sure it is safe, and yes, it is safe!",positive
I've had one before and someone from the moving company we used stole it. We had used it for 10 years and it was still nice enough to take. And now I find it on Amazon for $29.99! Can't beat the price.I hope the stew recipe is in the new owner's manual. It was some of the best stew we've ever had. I love meals from a pressure cooker way more than meals from a crock pot anyway.,positive
It is an excellent quality pressure cooker. Sturdy construction and the additional support tells you that it was made with quality and comfort in mind. I doubt if you will find a 4 quart pressure cooker with the additional support handle. Check this out before you buy another one.,positive
Bought for my daughter and she has used it several times and is sooo glad to have it...she and her family have loved every thing she has cooked in it...she is very short on time and has found this to be a great time saver but still able to cook really super meals!!,positive
"Very nice pressure cooker.  I good some collards in this and it works just fine.  I prefer the stainless over aluminum.Presto is a good name and it's been around a while.  Actually, I prefer these first generation cookers where you have the jiggler on top that jingles when the pressure is built up.",positive
"Was looking around to see is there any way to cook some things faster and I found this Presto Pressure Cooker. I can't imagine how we (my wife and me) did all cooking before! It is soooo faster and easier with this pressure cooker. And the size is right for 2-3 people, I like fresh food and this one as I said is just right capacity for our family of 3. If you fill it at max, you even will have some food for next day, but because the whole cooking takes 15-20 minutes from very beginnings to the end it is no longer concern.Also found that I need to cook usually less time than it is in cookbook. Made in China, but quality is outstanding and overall construction is very sturdy and will last long. I feel it safe enought also, they are 3 different systems integrated so it will not blow in your hands. With no doubt, must have item for every house. I'll get 6-Quart Presto sometime soon to coock large quantities which I will pack using FoodSaver and store in the freezer. It definitely worth every penny and I can't believe it cost only $30.",positive
"I have had the 4 quart pressure cooker for quite some time,  and based on its performance,  I purchased the 6 quart for myself and one for my daughter as well.  We are very pleased.  This is a good product,  but it is important to read and follow the instructions for use and care in order to get the most satisfactory results. I was raised with Presto pressure cookers, and have used others.  None have performed better, in my opinion.  The reasonable price is an added bonus.5/10/08: Presto offers a stainless steel steamer basket and a glass lid as optional accessories that fit both their 4 qt. and 6 qt. pressure cookers.  I purchased the steamer for my daughter and myself,  and the lid for myself.  These products have been welcome additions to our cooking tools.  Do not be afraid to spend the extra money for them...they are well worth it!",positive
I was so delightfully surprised to see how quickly this pressure cooked cooked my meat and stews. This pressure cooker packs a real punch by tenderizing my poultry in a short space of time. Great value for such an awesome pressure cooker. Also very easy to clean. Very happy with my Presto Pressure Cooker.,positive
"Presto 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure CookerThis pressure cooker has many positive points:  stainless steel, included rack for inside the cooker, and a good locking lid.  I've cooked beef, chicken, and pork with it, and it performs very well.  It's far superior to the aluminum one I had.  The recipe booklet had excellent suggestions so I can easily adapt my other favorite recipies to the pressure cooker.",positive
Turned it on and then the stainless steel started melting on the stove. I sent it back to the manufacturer and didn't get my money back. All I got was a coupon and there items are higher than Amazon wants.,positive
Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker.  Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous.  This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear.  I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.  Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!  I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively.  Have no fear......!,positive
We actually wanted to just purchase parts for an older Presto Pressure cooker but was disappointed to find out that parts were no longer available so we ended up buying this unity instead. The thing is holding up and has not been discontinued yet so we are quite satisfied with it,positive
"I found this pressure cooker to be everything I wanted.  Great size, easy to use, easy to clean up.  Highly recommend it.",positive
I purchased this for my mother who loves to cook (for everyone). She uses it and has never complained. It helps her cut the cost of using her oven.A good buy.,positive
"I chose this pressure cooker because it's the only kind of pressure cooker I've had experience using, it is stainless steel (non reactive, heavy weight), it was less expensive than more modern incarnations of pressure cookers (electric countertop, stove non jiggle top), and the reviews and follow up comments were helpful in convincing me that this was a quality product.The reviews praise the quality construction of this cooker and I couldn't agree more. I have used both natural pressure release and the method to speed it up by sticking the cooker in the sink and running cold water from the faucet over it (it takes all of 20 seconds and doesn't have to be so complicated as making an ice bath for it in the sink). I have never seen any signs of the metal layers splitting, the pot warping, and there has been no denting from handling and washing. The 6-quart capacity is enough for me and my husband to have soup with some left over for lunch or another soup dinner, but not so much that we're sick of eating the same thing.If you are trying to decide whether to get a pressure cooker in general, I would encourage you to go for it. Most weeknights, I am too impatient to wait for time-intensive things like tomato sauce, stew meat, root veggies cut into chunks, lentils, risotto, or even just tender cabbage. Pressure cookers prepare these things quickly and make them taste like they've been cooking forever. Most of the pressure cooker recipes I use take 30-40 minutes total for prep and cook (I usually make soup in this cooker), so it's become a life saver when I come home from work late.If you already know you want a pressure cooker but are trying to decide what type to get, I would say that I don't mind the simplicity of this cooker. Normally the justification to get a product that is the ""latest and greatest"" is that you are certain it will get a lot of use so you might as well spend the extra money for extra features that possibly save you time. This basic model is fine for weekly use in my household. I am definitely curious about newer types of cookers, but personally wasn't ready to pay more money for something I wasn't sure I would need.",positive
I hate to cook and have never used a pressure cooker.  After reading all the helpful reviews I made the leap and bought this one.  I LOVE IT!!!  It is not hard at all and I can't believe how fast it cooks.,positive
"I bought this exact model from Amazon in October 2005 and have cooked a few meals fine.  I also use the pot to boil water and have noticed that each time I do so, a few more rust spots form, so now the ""stainless steel"" pot is rusted completely inside.  I also use other stainless steel pots to boil water and they're all fine.Another problem is that the pop-up thing in the lid gets stuck often and I have to tap it to get it to pop up.  This issue is mentioned in the manual but that fact that it happens at all is a sign of poor design.The pot is made in China.  I recommend getting other similarly-priced but potentially better pots.As a followup (3/8/2006), I returned the pot to Presto and they were very surprised by the rust and said they'd never seen anything that bad so they're sending out another one.  I'll update this review with my experience with the new one.As a followup #2 (5/16/2006), I got a second pot from Presto and the same thing happened.  Rust all over the interior, just from boiling water.  I'm hoping to get my money back.Followup #3:  Presto engineers contacted me and asked for a sample of my tap water to test.  I sent them the sample but they never got back to me with the test results.  Customer service did refund my money though, so that was nice.  I suspect there might be something in our town's tap water that reacts with the pot.",positive
"I had an aluminum version of this same pressure cooker that I loved and used for many years.  I finally boiled something dry in it and it warped the bottom to the point that I couldn't use it any more.  I decided to upgrade to a stainless version because aluminum may or may not be good to cook in depending on who you ask.  This pot is considerably thinner than the aluminum one which I chalk up to steel being more durable, but the big problem with this one is that the handle on the lid doesn't line up with the handle on the pot.  It ends up being slightly to the left so then I have to back it off a little so that the safety knob will pop up to lock the lid.  It doesn't feel unsafe and it cooks well, but it is annoying and feels cheap.  I guess I'm stuck with this one but I won't be buying another one online if I can help it.  I'll be opening the box in the store and making sure the lid works first next time.",positive
"I bought this 6-qt stainless pressure cooker and have been very pleased with it.  The bottom is triple clad, and heavy-duty.  It is 'induction' ready, too, for those who cook by this method.  This pressure cooker is well worth the money and works well, cleans up well, and can accomodate the same stainless trivet and ""little pan"" that goes into the 8-qt stainless pressure cooker (which I bought before I got this 6-qt one.)",positive
"I am very happy with the quality, price, and versatility of this pressure cooker.  I have made some great tasting quick meals in a pinch, and use it as a 6 quart sauce pan as well. It works well with my induction cooktop.  As with any pressure cooker be careful with moving it!",positive
"Extremely well made. Assembly was pretty 101 easy. 6 quart is the perfect size for beans and lintels. If we were omnivores we'd need a bigger pot, but for vegans, 6 quart is perfect.  Stainless steel is high quality and supposedly healthier than aluminum.",positive
"I was so glad I got this pressure cooker and use it fairly often. So far, I have cooked roasts, chicken, white potatoes and sweet potatoes in it and just love it as you can cook these items in a lot ess than half the time it would normally take to cook the items. I don't know why it took me so long to get one.",positive
"I look a lot of lamb and beef , this makes the job quick and easy. 1 min pressure and meat is tender but maintains flavor . Needs rubber change in 3-6 months depending on usage",positive
"This is nothing fancy, but it works wery well. Replacemenat parts are easy to buy. You can't open it if it's under pressure because it has a lock by the handle (safety feature). Actually I think it's very safe as it has other features as well.I think one of the most important things to look for is what it's made of (after safety of course!). This is stainless steel which is good because you don't want aluminum (aluminum will stain and get eaten away with acidic food such as vinegar or lemon juice...).Another thing to consider is that it takes time to heat up and cool down so even though all pressure cookers say it takes a lot less time to cook, they don't take the heat-up cool-down time into consideration, even though they are correct about the actual cooking time.Good pressure cooker.EDITIn 2007, I bought a Kuhn-Rikon pressure cooker and I'm even more pleased with that.It's quite a bit more expensive  (4-7 times?) but a *lot* quieter as it relies on an internal spring to maintain pressure as opposed to gravity for the Presto. The Kuhn-Rikon also allows less water to escape. I keep both of them but I haven't used the presto for 4 months now. Considering I bought the Presto in 1999, it's amazing that it works perfectly even though it got heavy use. I even put the rubber seal and the lid in the dishwasher every time and it still held up. It's my backup cooker now as I can't let go of something that still works fine.",positive
"This is my first pressure cooker and I really like it.  For this price, it is a good choice for those who aren't sure if they will use it much.  It is especially useful for vegetarians.  Beans that normally take 2 hours to simmer in a sauce pan are done in 20 minutes in the pressure cooker.  I was afraid to use it at first but there are safety features which should make you comfortable using it.  As long as it is under pressure, you cannot open the top.Although I do like this product, it is overly large for my needs.  If you just plan on cooking a cup or two of beans at a time, I would recommend getting the 4 qt version of this product.  Because the pressure cooker is so fast, there's really no need to make large batches of things.",positive
"I never really thought I would be writing a review to praise a pressure cooker. But, anyways I am. Some of the most common problems that people face with pressure cookers are: loud sound, too many whistles and food that sticks to the bottom never comes off while cleaning. This cooker is a pleasant surprise, because none of these problems happen with this Presto. I simply dumped lentils, carrots, peas and pearl onions altogether into this cooker and boom, after 30 minutes, the lentils soup was ready. Now, you may think what is so special about this. Well, here is the interesting part. Generally, when lentils are cooked in pressure cookers, they appear like separate lentil seeds cooked individually and do not gel with the vegetables together to form into a running soup. But, after cooking in this Presto cooker, the whole thing turned out to be a perfect soup, even without me putting any extra effort to mix the vegetables with a spatula. It blended the lentils and vegetables in such a beautiful way that it was just ready to eat. Now, here is the good part, it did not make annoying whistles, it did not pour even a single drop of water or soup out of the top and the inner side of the lid is immaculate even after cooking three cups of lentils. So, that means, nothing was spilling during the cooking process. It is the most controlled and well-designed cooker I have ever used in my whole life. Trust me you will not be disappointed. Whenever, you cook in this cooker, it will make you feel like something healthy is in store for you to eat and also gets you excited to eat it hot from the stove and of course contributes to a much more healthy lifestyle.",positive
"I love my pressure cooker. Super reliable and if you follow the directions, it always cooks perfectlly Brown rice is cooked in 12 minutes! My first lesson was to factor in the amount of time it takes for the pressure cooker to cool down enough to open the lid. That usually takes another 10 minutes - if you are trying to orchestrate all your food being ready at the same time for a hot meal. I am guessing the cool down time is also part of the cooking process. The instruction/cook book that comes with it is very right on and helpful. Very east to clean, make sure you take out the rubber gasket from the lid and clean it well after each use. I have read that pressure cooking retains more nutrients in the food than any other type of cooking. Makes sense because so little steam or anything escapes.",positive
"it cooked a nice meal, however, after very first time cooking there (whole chicken), the bottom of pan browned at some spots. I have tried everything, and cannot get those brown spots out :(. I used a good amount of olive oil, white wine, and 1/3 of water.",positive
"I have owned and used this cooker for several years. It is the perfect size for my 2 person household. Many empty nesters and those with small kitchens will find this a terrific product.The accessories make this pot multifunctional and expand its usefulness. There is :- a steamer basket- a glass lid- a strainer lid - which locks in place like the pressure cooking lid for draining hot liquid from pasta, veggies,etc. The locking capability of the strainer lid makes draining hot liqiuds very easy and safe.There are many books available for those unfamiliar to pressure cooking such asPressure Perfect: Two Hour Taste in Twenty Minutes Using Your Pressure Cookerand many others. The options are unlimited and so you are not stuck with only pot roast or stew. You can even bake  cheesecake in the pressure cooker. Pick a book and get started!The Presto website is another great resource with lots of recipes and tips.This cooker saves time, conserves energy (propane in my case), and prevents loss of nutrients in food while giving delicious results.Do not let the stories of pressure cookers exploding from way back when frighten you.  The newer cookers have safety features to prevent this.The Presto brand is very common across the country so the parts are widely available.The sealing ring must be replaced on all pressure cookers  periodically no matter who the manufacturer is. Many hardware stores (mom and pop as well as large chains) carry thePresto Pressure Cooker Sealing Ring/Overpressure Plug Pack (4 & 6 Quart). An important  consideration to make before purchase.",positive
"I needed a 4-quart stainless steel sauce pan and a stovetop pressure cooker.  This Presto cooker doubles nicely for both.  I already own an 8-quart electric pressure cooker but wanted something smaller for the smaller meals.  So far I have used it as a pressure cooker 2x, searing meat 1x, and sauteing unions 2x.  I'm glad I went this route instead of buying this Presto cooker and shelling out another $50-60 for another stainless steel sauce pan.",positive
"After reading a review that said go to Ebay, I did and got 20 belts for $17.95 and free shipping from one of their highest rated sellers.  They are bulk generic, just like these, but I have had good luck with generic.  I have a bag type commercial model from Sams Club and I was told before buying it that it was notorious for breaking belts.  Belt breakage is a small price to pay for the way the vacuum works.  It was suggested by the carpet installer that did our house and he was right.  No dust, clean carpet.  I guess I drifted from reviewing the belts, but Walmart gets $3.50 for two belts and I got these for less than .50 apiece.  Here is the link.[...]Hate to do this to Amazon, but if you have a commercial bag type it will last years and you will save loads.  If they turn out to be no good I will edit my post.  Amazon is still the number one by far for my purchasing preference.  Most of the time you can't beat the price and you will never beat their service, never.  fredt",positive
"It replaced a broken belt in the Eureka c2000 series upright, and after month later it still works.  The value was very good.",positive
"These are hard to find locally.  Although the description says Genuine Eureka belts, they came in generic plastic bag.  They seem to wear about as well as the original belt.  Price is great.",positive
"Buy a package or two to keep around so that when you get the urge to vacuum and clean house, you don't have the aggravation of being stuck without a replacement belt for your vacuum cleaner.  While you're at it, stock up on bags, too.  Like the old Scouting motto, &#34;Be Prepared!&#34;",positive
"I know nothing about vacuum cleaner belts other than I needed one.Fast service, belt was pretty easy to install and I have an extra one if needed.",positive
"Whats to say..They are drive belts for our eight year old eureka vacuum cleaner, they fit fine, fast free shipping, could not find a better price, very pleased.",positive
"These are the real deal.  AUTHENTIC Eureka belts for use with the Sanitaire's and any other of the older style uprights that have the belt running down the middle of the brushroll.  I have tried generic belts in the past and most have suffered from premature failure and ""burnout"".  Some have even cracked and broke as a result of the heat and friction created when the motor is running. It all depends on the type--and quality--of the rubber folks.  There is a reason manufacturers recommend sticking with genuine replacement parts.  Though generic belts/bags *may* fill the void, my experience has always been less than positive.  These fit my 30+ year old Eureka upright perfectly and make it run like new once again.  I also refuse to part with this machine because I firmly believe it outperforms many of the newer models on the market today.  What's more, the maintenance and design of these older vacuums are such that you can usually do the work yourself.  If you understand how these vacuums work and are mechanically inclined, they are virtually maintenance free.  There is literally nothing that can go wrong on these machines except the belt and the occasional light burnout.  I generally need to change my mine roughly every 2-3 months depending on use.  Also, carpets with tassels and loose threads wreak havoc on these things--get rid of them.  They are nothing but a nuisance anyway.  Overall, I'm quite pleased and hope that Eureka continues to make these available for the long term.",positive
"Do what they are supposed to, work well with my vacuum. Great value for belts. Good vacuum belts. Haven't broken yet.",positive
"Don't kid yourself into buying non-name brand belts.  These belts are not joined horizontally which would cause them to break much, much more quickly.  They're bonded vertically all the way around which makes them very strong.  It's worth a few extra pennies to buy something that's going to last much longer.",positive
"In the past I have taken my vacuum to a vac shoppe to have belts replaced.  Decided to try it myself, but couldn't find the belts in local stores for my vacuum.  These work and it was easy to do.",positive
"I got this for my old Vac.Fits fine, works, i have a spare, life is good. three more words to make 20.",positive
"I ordered this belt for my vacuum and it turned out to be the wrong one. GoVacuum customer service researched the correct belt and offered to not only give me a refund, but send the correct belt free of charge. Very nice people to deal with and extremely knowledgeable about products. They get a A+ from me.",positive
"So we've had this vacuum cleaner for a bit over a  year now. It was purchased September 8, 2009.Currently, my wife is complaining that the vacuum is not providing enough suction to pick up the dirt. The bag in the back was emptied so we know that's not the problem. Time is going to be spent trying to figure out what's wrong with it, and it may be finished das far as I know.My impression of the vacuum over time hasn't been that great. It performed rather poorly on hardwood flooring from the start, and I can't say I was overly impressed on carpet. It's clunky to move around, and when the bag approaches full it tends to tip over.",positive
"I've been vacuuming for over 40 years and I enjoy trying new products.I have a myriad of machines, from $100.00 to $1400.00.  No matter what I try, Eureka makes the best vacuuming products and this particular model is best for carpets.  The ergonomics are perfect, but the singularly winning aspect of this machine is it's strong suction and firm grabbing power as you pull it back toward yourself. It's easy use is a huge plus for me - no need to disassemble, re-arrange, clean or empty trays, reassemble, etc.  I just tap the 'On' button, release the handle and go.  I'll buy one of these for every floor in the house and keep each plugged in and ready to go.",positive
"I've only had this vacuum for 2 months but it's everything the other reviews said it was.  It's light and easy to maneuver.  I have two long hair cats and it has no problem with all of the shedding.  I like the carpet level adjustment so I can do the bare floor as well as the carpet (for thorough cleaning I use a small wand vacuum for the bare floors).  Assembly is a cinch, took me under 1/2 hour.  Returned my Oreck in favor of this one.",positive
"In the early 80's my parents bought one of these Eureka vacuums during a K-Mart Blue-Light Special ($60) and used it as their only vacuum until I inherited it and have used it since. It still runs, but the motor bearings are worn out. This one appeared almost identical to the original so I couldn't resist ordering it. The shape of the motor housing has been modernized a bit but most of the machine is identical, wheels, handle, belt, bag, etc. (Evidently Electrolux now owns Eureka as the ad says Electrolux, however, only the name Eureka appears on the machine, like the original!)Obviously, this is not the most powerful or sophisticated vacuum available, but it definitely has a place in the home. It has adequate power for routine cleaning. It is reasonably quiet, quite light, and is inexpensive. The combination of its adequate but not excessive vacuum and its good brush design makes it preferable to our bag-less machine for cleaning some of our more valuable rugs. (The bag-less is better on carpets.) In addition, it works well for use in our RV.",positive
"This vacuum really sucks....but in a GOOD way.The motor is plenty strong.  You can actually see it pick up the carpet.  Just be careful not to get anything (throw rug fringe, shoe laces, etc.) caught in it.I would give it a 5-Star rating except for the plastic handle.  It feels flimsy.  You'll probably need to replace the handle before the motor gives out.Overall, I'm glad I bought it.",positive
"Great suction/vacuum power. Used in an apartment with wooden floor. The $ (dollar) value of the vacuuming power is awesome. It is a great advantage to not have additional attachments that will take away from the main vacuum. At the value of this vacuum, one can afford an independent and highly effective smaller hand-vac if hose attachments are desired.",positive
"I just moved into an apartment with a new synthetic carpet that sheds like a pack of afghan hounds; it choked my bagless vacuum in under a minute.  I needed a sturdy, no-frills, bagged vacuum like the Montgomery Ward upright I used for over 20 years before it died.This model was almost identical, and now that I've had it for a few weeks, I'm happy as a clam.  It has an old-fashioned rotating brush/beater roller, 5 carpet height adjustments, great suction for 5 amps, and comes pre-fitted with a humongous disposable liner bag (type F&G;), plus a spare belt for the roller.  Some parts that used to be steel have been replaced with thick plastic, but it seems plenty sturdy, and it's much lighter to maneuver and carry than my old all-steel model.  The on/off button and lock/unlock for the handle are both on the base, so they're foot controls; carpet height is adjusted by a dial on the front of the base.  The long cord (20 feet or so) doesn't retract, you just wind it over hooks on the handle.  The spring-attached fabric bag has a full-length zipper, inside which the disposable bag (which fills the cover from end to end) slides on with another spring.  Quick, simple.One pass with this puppy picked up enough carpet fluff missed by the bagless to knit a throw rug, but there's still plenty of room left for future dirt.  It's also a lot less noisy than my smaller bagless.  The only qualm I had in buying this was the lack of attachments for cleaning upholstery & suchlike, but I found an inexpensive accessory kit made for it (crevice tool, round dust brush, upholstery brush, extension tubes, looooong flexible hose) right here on Amazon:  the ""Electrolux Home Care 60E 6-Piece Deluxe Tool Set,""  so my joy is complete.Though the image on this page looks rather green, the vacuum is actually jet black, and the bag is a black-white-red random print.  It comes in a flat box, minor assembly required.  Highly recommended for those who remember how good the old vacuums were, don't want to spend a fortune just to clean their carpets, or are into retro styling.",positive
"My original vacuum had a hepa filter on it that needing replacing and apparently the manufacturer no longer made them.  I ordered this vacuum because all it needed was a bag.  I am very pleased with it.  It is fairly quiet for a vacuum cleaner, my old model used to scream like a banshee,  and it doesn't have a bunch of hoses wrapped around it constantly coming loose like my old model.  It cleans the carpet just as well as the old model.If you just need to vacuum the floor, this model is great.",positive
"This vacuum had great suction but the body was not sturdy enough to match its force. I had to take it apart, change belts and many other things that I have never had to do with any other vacuum. Good in theory, not in practice.",positive
"Rated a one (1) simply because it was not assembled and I have no idea how it would work.That was unfortunate, because, I have an older model of this Vac and It was great.  I would had to  have taken this item to a Vac. repair to have it assembled.  This infor should have been on the web site.",positive
Great to be able to get replacement parts for my machine. Have enough to last me for guite awile now.,positive
"These are real Hoover vacuum bags. They're easy to replace, and they do a good job filtering the dirt out.",positive
"These bags are as advertised... They fit the model of vacuum I have and do a good job of filtration. Also, they were shipped quickly.",positive
"They fit the vacuum cleaner and they retain dust and dirt. What else is there? They work OK, in other words,",positive
"These are vacuum cleaner bags from the original equipment manufacturer. They are inexpensive, they fit, they work, they make you happy.",positive
Been useing these vacuum bags for many years they are good quality and the price here was very good wold recommend to others,positive
"Since I didn't write at least 20 words the first time, I'll more fully recommend these bags.  They are a lovely pastel color, and come in a sealed plastic bag, so if the mailman hangs the package from the mailbox when it is raining, they will not get wet.  They were also folded nicely.  I have Prime, and when I first bought them, I was not given the option of buying  nine, so I had to wait to buy something else to be able to get them.  I was not really happy about this, but I expected that Amazon would have them cheaper than I could buy locally at the &#34;big box&#34; stores.  I am a daily vacuumer, and bought a Dyson from Amazon, but it lost its suction in seven months, and luckily I had saved my two Hoovers... a convertible and a concept two (which I think is from the 80's, and still is wonderful) so I use a lot of bags.  I would much rather throw a bag away than have to empty that cylinder every day.  Well, since I found that I can buy them locally for the same price, or the Arm and H..... ones for half that price, I won't be buying them any more from Amazon, but I still really like the vacuum bags, and they have proven their worth.  Hopefully I have covered the subject well enough for Amazon.",positive
I am a Hoover fan and avid user of their vacuums.  Therefore I always purchase Hoover Vacuum Bags where I know I will get the same quality of bag as I have in the vacuum.  These never disappoint and a great prize on Amazon.,positive
"The filter bag worked as advertised. I don't know what else is there to say about a vacuum cleaner bag, but this one is a good one.",positive
Easier for me to purchase from Amazon than to go out to the stores. I am satisfied. They fit my vacuum perfectly.,positive
The bags were received promptly and are everything I needed (with the exception of 1 million dollars).  I am very satisfied with the order.,positive
"I love buying things I use constantly from Amazon instead of searching through stores looking for different items.  When you get a bit older and knees and arthritis bother you,  Amazon is heaven sent.  These bags work perfectly for my old Hoover vacuum.  Bought enough so I won't run out for quite some time.  Thanks Amazon.",positive
"There's not much to say about vacuum cleaner bags; if you need them, you buy them.  But I've had my Hoover upright vaccum cleaner for longer than I can remember, and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find these &#34;special&#34; bags that store dirt from the top of the bag, instead of the bottom...  Amazon to the rescue!",positive
came on a Monday when I order it on Friday it was rainin that day but thank god they had wrapped it perfectly waterproof and everything will be ordering more soon :),positive
"works in vacuum ,  ok",positive
These bags are durable and easy to install and remove.  I've used a number of them and never had an issue of bags breaking or leaking.  RECOMMEND!,positive
"Picture of bag says 'Genuine HOOVER Filter Bags. I was sold and shipped a 3-pack of genuine imitation generic bags instead. While they were made in the USA and may be just as good, don't bait and switch products on customers. I purposely choose theses because they were supposed to be real HOOVER bags.",positive
"I have an older vacuum and was worried that I wouldn't be able to find the right kind of bags for it, but I looked around on Amazon and found these.  They are allergen filtration bags and trap dust mites, mold and cat dander.  The Type A is still used in quite a few vacuum cleaners from what I read on the bags, so these should be available for some time.",positive
"The Hoover F4300 Floormax Supreme I ordered Dec. 29th arrived Jan 3!  Using Super Saver Free Shipping!It wasn't due until as late as Jan 16th, but there it was.And it is WONDERFUL!  The FLOOR I COULD NOT GET CLEAN WAS CLEAN! ...within minutes of completing the very easy assembly!This floor is one of those old linoleum floors with tiny grooves as part of the design...supposed to look like mediterranean tile.I don't plan to use it for rugs... I'll get myself another Hoover rug steamer with 5 circulating scrubbing disks for that!  But for cleaning the rest of my floors, the Hoover F4300 Floormax Supreme is my baby!Not only did it clean like a whiz....but it was so easy and smooth to direct it was almost like using a magic wand to scrub the floor!  It got right up next to the wall and pulled out hair and yuck...without splashing the wall!  It was amazing!I had one of these many years ago, but this one is even better!  It's far easier to handle and way quieter.My only regret is not ordering it a long time ago!Thank you Hoover and Amazon!",positive
"I loved it so much when it was moved where I could not find it readily, I bought another one! It is a great little scrubber. I have not used it to polish, but I'm sure it would do a good job. I just have a lot of hard floor to scrub.",positive
"We purchased this unit originally for our own use, because our relatives had one of these always available happily for decades, but later, we shared this unit with a close family who needed it to help them with maintenance of newly refurbished wood flooring, and now that WE are writing this review, WE are reminded that WE really need to purchase another of these units in the not too distant future, hopefully still available from Amazon, when it comes time for us to make another purchase of it, because WE feel after years of family use, that this type of unit really is the BEST to use to clean and polish floors and make the job at hand the easiest possible, and the family we shared our other unit with, also voiced this same response to us as well. Blessings to you in all your floor maintenance adventures.",positive
"The cord is too short but I use this to scrub tile, car/truck mats and have even thrown Ajax on my shower floor and patio and scrubbed them clean with this.  It's a life saver.  And it has lasted for years through a lot of abuse",positive
The liquid despenser not great.  But it is light weight and buffs my wood floors nicely,positive
"Although I haven't used it yet,(due to a leg injury) I had one years ago and I found it to do a good job on carpet and linoleum.  I am actually looking forward to when I can use it. The price is also well within range for the average person. I have used Hoover products regularly for most of my adult life.",positive
"Good product for the dough.  A bit tricky to put together, tube to the water dispenser didn't fit right, but I rigged it up and it works fine.  No other alternative in this price range, I'm overall happy.Mike",positive
"This is a GREAT, light weight cleaning machine. I'm cleaning a house to put on the market and this little machine has already saved countless hours. The entire lower level is tile and the upper level is carpet with a linoleum floored kitchen. I got the tile cleaned in no time with this machine, it did a beautiful job cleaning and restoring the tile to like new condition. I have started cleaning the carpet and am very pleased with the results. The brushes are powering out stains/dirt that the steam cleaner wasn't getting, and the brushes have raised the carpet pile in high traffic areas that were matted down. After using the Floormax, I extract the excess fluid from the carpet with a steam cleaner and then steam rinse with clean hot water; the results are amazing. The carpet brushes get right up to the baseboard so there are no dirty carpet edges. I also cleaned the old linoleum in the kitchen and was surprised how beautiful this old floor actually is. The Floormax removed all of the old dirt and stains, a coat of Future made it look brand new.I highly recommend this product - it's easy to assemble, a time saver...and a knee and back saver too! The only drawback is the excess fluid it leaves behind to be wiped up.",positive
Good product.  I expect to be using this buffer for years to come.,positive
"My Mom bought me one of these from Walmart when I was in middleschool. Ive kept it ever since... Its lasted through highschool, going to summer camp, it went to college with me (I used it as extra seating and as a bed a couple of times). It made it through moving 3 times after college and the only reason it didnt deploy with me (much better than Army Toughboxes) is that it didnt have wheels. its lasted half a lifetime and still doesnt even have a strach on it. I love this thing!",positive
"I bought four of these for $27 each at Home Depot.  I carry them in the back of my pickup truck when I need tools and toss them in the garage when I don't need them.  It makes it easy to load my truck in a hurry.What I like about them.1.  They will stack with the lid on.2.  They nest inside each other when empty3.  Lid is fairly sturdy--you can sit on one if you are careful.4.  Having a bunch of them, means they all are the same height if you want to build a platform.5.  With the lid on they are waterproof.6.  Locking handles have a solid secure feel to them.7.  With only one handle locked it act like a hinge--you can open it from one side.8.  You can write on the lids with a Sharpie pen.9.  Good size for lifting and carrying.  I've had something similar but larger and found it was too hard to lift when loaded.  These are a good size.What I didn't like.1.  One had a damaged handle.  I was going to return it, but they were out.  I can repair it with a drill and a cotter pin--so I decided to keep it anyway.2.  Hard to find more locally.I'd buy more of these if I could find them.  I use them to sort tools and activities by type.  For example, I use one for power tools, one for fiberglass materials, one for general tools.  I'd like one for camping gear.I'd give it five stars except for the one defective one I purchased.  Functionally they are excellent.  I'd recommend buying them locally and carefully inspecting them to be sure you have ones that are defect free.",positive
"Ipurchaed this packer cargo box in lieu of more expensive ATV boxes.  I use it on my 650cc atv to carry a multitude of items,  I did add some D rings to hold tie downs to hole items from bouncing around,  this works very well and keeps items in their place,  it has been used in various weather conditions and suffered no leaks, everything stays dry and in place now",positive
"We purchased two Action Packer cargo boxes to fit on our Valley Cargo Carrier.  The 48-gallon and the 32-gallon boxes fit perfectly side-by-side on the carrier. We expected the boxes to be rain-proof and waterproof, and they do not disappoint.  We have driven thru heavy rain with driving wind with these babies, and everything inside was a dry as could be - not a drop of moisture inside.  We leave them outside when we camp, through some severe thunderstorms and still no rain gets in.  They fit our purpose perfectly.We did not purchase the cargo boxes from Amazon; our local Wal-Mart had much better pricing in the automotive department.If you want to add wheels, the 48-gallon model has drill-out spots for attaching casters.  Personally, I don't want to do that because I want to keep the integrity of the water tight properties intact, and I don't want wheels on the cargo carrier.  But it is certainly an option for those who want it, and looks pretty easy to accomplish.So why 4 stars instead of 5? The handles. I wish that the handles were deeper or perhaps had folding handles.  The boxes are difficult to carry when heavily packed. I might try to drill out holes to add rope handles, but that water tight issue has stopped me so far. Other than that one detail, these cargo boxes are perfect for us.",positive
"I got the 35-gallon size to store some items in the basement that I wanted to be able to get to conveniently but also be able to lock up and keep out of the kids' hands. This box is absolutely perfect for what I intended. Maybe even a bit of overkill on my part (this thing is super solid) but better safe than sorry. It is very well made. Of course, I'm not truly putting it through its paces by using it in a truck bed or travelling through air ports with it or anything like that, but after receiving it and having a chance to see how well made it is, I have little doubt it would excel for those uses as well.Note: If you are looking on putting a lock on it, I recommend you get the ""cable"" style of Master combo lock that Amazon suggests. The latch hole might be a bit tricky with a different style of lock. Not impossible, but a heckuva lot harder to use than the cable.",positive
"OMG!!! this thing is HUGE!!!I just love these things. there is so much you can do with them.use them to store stuff in a home/apartment, on a vacation, a fishing trip, the list of uses is limited only by one's imagination.I have a 15 gallon one(not sure if they still make this size) & I thought that held a lot...this one is so much bigger & roomier...the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15, & is built just a solidly as the former.After filling this, it can be used for extra seating, a footstool, an extra table maybe...These things are built like a rock!!These are like the ultimate in storage boxes.Would I recommend this to my friends?  yes I would.",positive
"I bought this to mount on a bike trailer from CycleRevolution in Oregon. Excellent box: light, tough, waterproof, strong closure. Holds lots of bags of groceries.",positive
"I use this to keep packages on the porch safe to get picked up, but it could be used for all kinds of things of course.It's sturdy, moves around great, and it looks good too, people can even sit on it without worrying about breaking it.",positive
"I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof, animal proof, and that I can jam pack into the closet so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  This was perfect!It clamps down well, is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise, its a small, durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?",positive
"I took this from FT. Bliss to Iraq and so far it has held up 10X better then those flimsy foot lockers that they sell at the exchange. definately worth every penny. Still locked, still in one piece, lid still closes. Looks great, and everything inside is in one piece. wouldn't trade it for the world. May even buy some more!",positive
"Excellent durability.  Good space inside and latches closed.  Would be better if it was taller and not as wide so one person could carry it.  As built now, you will need two people to handle this huge bin.  Would also help if the handholds were deeper.  Overall, very good.Update 11/22/11:  Not as durable as I had originally thought.  Sat on one of these (I'm not very heavy) and the molded seem on the lid split, so now I'm getting water inside the hollow lid.  And yes, the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance.  Still, it's a decent box that continues to function okay.",positive
"I purchased 2 of the 24 Gallon size, one to use as an emergency medical supply container and one to utilize as a portable survival (bug out) box. I found that the 24 gallon size is plenty large enough for each of my intended uses, I kept my items limited to what was most basic and necessary and I still have room for some additional items.I am pleased that I got the 24 gallon size for my purposes because even when they are packed I can still lift them and they are easily transportable, I would think a larger size container that was packed may be too heavy to handle without help.I have posted some pictures, they have hard plastic handles that snap into position and they have a place for you to lock then. Sturdy enough construction and appear to be rugged and durable.",positive
"I fit a metric crap-ton of stuff in this thing. It does exactly what I wanted and is just the right size where I can fit a LOT of stuff in it, but it doesn't take up a HUGE amount of space riding in the back of my Suburban.",positive
"I got a lot of stuff. Thus I need a lot of tubs. These are durable and sturdy. Use it for a table when you're camping. If you drop it in the water it will leak, but otherwise this is the best tub ever.",positive
It's very durable & holds a lot. I bought it for the back of my daughter pick up truck (dodge Dakota). My only disappointment was that it wasn't long enuf to kinda touch each side of the back. I was hoping for it to fit snug but otherwise it's exactly what I was looking for just not long enuf.,positive
This Rubbermaid cargo box is really nice . I purchased it to store my hunting clothes. It has plenty of room for bulky down jackets and insulated coveralls.,positive
"This is a great size, It fits, snugly, in the rear of our Sedona van with all the seats in place.  It is a nice size I carrly my tirechains, washer fluid, oil, stc. and hav room left over.  Plus it looks very nice with our grey interior,",positive
Whatever issue the previous reviewer's had it has now been resolved. This is a great product and came exactly as described!,positive
"I bought an ActionPacker box exactly like this one many, many (20?) years ago to serve as a newspaper box on my front steps. It has sat out in broiling sun, freezing winter, pouring rain, and the worst that happened was that the color faded and it started looking a bit grungy. I was delighted to see that these were still available, and the new one looks just like the old one, but with brighter colors (and less dirt!) It should be good for another 20 years!",positive
"Not much to write about here, but it does exactly what it's supposed to. filters out the pop sounds. now my recordings are much more crisp. it is one of the lowest prices pop filters on amazon so might as well buy it, they honestly work the same despite their pricing,",positive
"The product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable.I did not realized it was double screened until it arrived, so it was even better than I had expected.As an added bonus, one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy I used to buy, so for reminiscent's sake, I cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording. :DIf you needed a pop filter, this will work just as well as the expensive ones, and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did!Buy this product! :]",positive
"The primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound, while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies. The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration. The metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached. The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it.",positive
Nice windscreen protects my MXL mic and prevents pops. Only thing is that the gooseneck is only marginally able to hold the screen in position and requires careful positioning of the clamp to avoid sagging.,positive
This pop filter is great. It looks and performs like a studio filter. If you're recording vocals this will eliminate the pops that gets recorded when you sing.,positive
"So good that I bought another one.  Love the heavy cord and gold connectors.  Bass sounds great.  I just learned last night how to coil them up.  I guess I should read instructions more carefully.  But no harm done, still works great!",positive
"I have used monster cables for years, and with good reason. The lifetime warranty is worth the price alone. Simple fact: cables break, but getting to replace them at no cost is where it's at.",positive
I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980's... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins.,positive
Perfect for my Epiphone Sheraton II.  Monster cables are well constructed.  I have several and never had any problems with any of them over the years.  Got this one because I wanted the 90 degree plug.,positive
Monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either. This isnt their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time. You cant go wrong with Monster Cables.,positive
"Monster makes a wide array of cables, including some that are very high end. I initially purchased a pair ofMonster Rock Instrument Cable - 21 Feet - Angled to Straight 1/4-Inch plugto use with my keyboards, but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar I thought I'd pinch a few pennies.  I am so glad I did.I compared this cable model to the more expensive models I previously purchased and, aside from looks, could not detect any difference in sound. I Swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards, ensuring that each model was used on each instrument - still no difference.What the more expensive model has going for it is looks. I am not sure it (the higher priced model) is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling.Bottom line: carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp - if possible - before making a purchase decision. You may find, as I did, that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value, even from the same manufacturer.",positive
I got it to have it if I needed it. I have found that i don't really need it that often and rarely use it. If I was really good I can see the need. But this is a keyboard not an organ.,positive
"I love it, I used this for my Yamaha ypt-230 and it works great, I would recommend it to anyone",positive
"I bought this to use with my keyboard. I wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. It doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano, which is what I'd always used. Doesn't have the same feel either. Nowhere close.In my opinion, a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. The only thing I've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals.",positive
"This Fender cable is the perfect length for me! Sometimes I find it a bit too long but I don't mind. The build quality is great and I know that it will last. The only gripe I have with this cable is that the metal sleeve gets unscrewed way too easily, requiring me to tighten it often.Sound quality is not affected, and the color is cool, definitely try this cable out.",positive
wanted it just on looks alone...It is a nice looking cord... I know it will perform...as for Sam Ash ...this cord was packed in a mailer inside another box with my Roc n Soc... his shipping team do great work..never any complaints from me... I love Sam Ash.. thanks Amazon,positive
"I've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well.  For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.Edit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves-",positive
Fender cords look great and work just as well. By adding the word California to the description I'm sure to sound like the Beach Boys...,positive
"This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. You'll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber, but other than that, the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that.",positive
The Fender 18 Feet California Clear Instrument Cable - Lake Placid Blue  is a very good extra cord for a good price.,positive
Very good cable. Well made and it looks great with my Candy Apple Red Tele. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it tends not to lay flat on the floor.,positive
"Got this cable to run a rockband keyboard controller to my M-audio profire 2626 to control midi in Pro Tools. Works great! Firm fit, solidly molded ends, reputable branded cable.(a bit on the thin side, but i haven't seen to have any issue due to this or anything. Couldn't go wrong for $5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility.",positive
"When I was searching for MIDI cables for my ART X-15 foot controller, I came across these Hosa ones, and they were $2 dollars each! As they are now $6, I realize I would still be happy with that price as well, as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors, and work flawlessly. You must realize that they are only 5 feet, as I overestimated it and now wish they were longer. For any connection from racked sound modules, this will be perfect.",positive
Cant go wrong. Great quality on a budget price  - Hosa is the go to when you need to hook things up,positive
"The ends of the midi cable look and feel like quality. Connection is secure, no worries about uneven connections, it also detaches without a hitch. Highly recommended.",positive
"Just trying to find a midi to midi was a task, and you have to make sure the pin config is correct.  This one is a good product and works just fine",positive
I bought these to go from my board to the amp. We use them for a mobile church so they take a beating. They are still going strong.,positive
"Sturdy cord and plugs, inexpensive, good value. I don't require professional-level equipment, so this cord serves my purposes well. Satisfied with purchase.",positive
"Use it every week at gigs.  Solid, no problems with the solder joints.  A good quality cable at a very good price.",positive
"Hosa products are a good bang for the buck. I haven't looked up the specifications, but I'm guessing the wire is 22 to 24 AWG, but since it's only 10' long, it's good enough.",positive
This was exactly what I was after. I have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect. Before I used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches. I highly recommend this for those who keep the mic on a stand and have a voice touch or other stand connected device for vocals.,positive
I bought these because I really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show. And these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself. Who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place? I bought two because I use a Digitech Live 2 Harmony processor and two XLR mike cords are required to make it operational. Good price here too. Hard to find just 10' mike cords. Usually longer ones are only obtainable.,positive
This cable seems like it will last me for a while. As it is only being used to connect a DI box it will not get abused as much as the vocal mics always do.,positive
"These are not the greatest but they're cheap and they get to you fast when you need them. I've only had one fail and I've bought many of them to use in our broadcast studio.Amazon is the first place I go when I need cables for audio, video, computers or concert lighting.Good music to all!",positive
"This is a fine cable at a decent price point, nothing exceptional mind, but it gets the job done well enough.",positive
"I've used a lot of cables and I always come back to HOSA, they are indeed some of the best audio cables in their price range on the market.",positive
"I bought this cord after returning a cheap one that I should've known better than to buy. My son, who has some experience as a musician recommended the Hosa brand when I was seeking a proper replacement.I bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Behringer Xenyx 302 Mixer, and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic; the sound quality is excellent.An excellent value for the money.",positive
"Nice solid cables, with excellent support at the ends.  Should last a lifetime of usage no problem and just what I needed to connect my tube preamp.",positive
Good quality cable and sounds very good,positive
"Zero issues with this cable so far.  It feels fairly cheap and light weight but it has survived for months of plugging in, unplugging, and packing between practice spaces.I'll update this review if/when it breaks.",positive
Realtively inexpensive patch cable for electric guitar.I have had it for a few months and so far it has held up pretty well,positive
"I bought this because I wanted a cheap replacement cable for one that had a short. I'm pleasantly surprised with this cable. It's decent sound and decent build quality, for a good price.",positive
"This is a very nice cable for the price. I already bent one end of it though, fortunately it still works fine. Inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic. Haven't noticed any hum or crackles. For sure a good buy.",positive
Cheap and good texture rubber that does not get stiff.  Only time will tell how well the soldering is.  Sounds fine to me.,positive
"Seems sturdy enough, and no noise issues, so I'm pretty much satified with it; it doesn't leave the house so I'm not asking it to handle a lot, but with reasonable care it should last a while.",positive
"I'm not a professional, but have been playing for many, many years.  This is the best cord I've ever had, though I'm sure Eric Clapton has something better.",positive
"This Hosa Cable is very well made, with good quality connectors and a nice long length. My son is expanding his collection of amps and effects pedals so needed additional cables to get everything connected. This 25' cable gives him flexibility to move around and it is sturdy enough that it can take being stepped on and pulled around.The cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable.Highly Recommended!CFH",positive
"Bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar. It seems to work well, no issues in the first couple of weeks.",positive
"It hums, crackles, and I think I'm having problems with my equipment.  As soon as I use any of my other cords then the problem is gone.  Hosa makes some other products that have good value.  But based on my experience I don't recommend this one.",positive
"I am not hard on cables.  I typically just plug them in to my guitar, dont move around much, and play for an hour or two a day.  this one seem to perform just fine.  no buzz, and/or other noises noted.  I have several of them and they have all performed well.",positive
"I have found Hosa cables to be an excellent value. More expensive cables may be more rugged, but for the price, I'm very happy with the Hosa's I have purchased.",positive
"This is good cable. Excellent 1/4&#34; plugs. The lugs and solder joints are covered with heat shrink material, which will hold everything in place for years. Grade A+ cable at a very affordable price. Definitely  going back for more. The 25 ft. cable was only a couple dollars more than 10 ft.",positive
"Pretty crappy cable. It works and gets the job done, but after purchasing this product and using it, I will shell out the extra bucks for better quality.",positive
I use this cord in my church to run from my pedalboard to my amp (which is in a soundproof box). The cord is reliable and clean sounding. I like it and have used HOSA products in the past with confidence. Excellent cord. Hopefully this review will be usefull to you.,positive
"This my second Hosa guitar cable.  (The other one is shorter.)  Like my first Hosa cable, this is a high quality item.  I'd definitely buy more cables of this brand.",positive
"Works for practice ... it's a guitar instrument cable, what can I say ... maybe not the best but it serves it's purpose.",positive
In my opinion it does not hurt to have extra guitar cables around. From experience they tend to just die without notice. I have a feeling this one will last a long time. It is built sturdy and sounds really good.I recommend this product.,positive
Hosa guitar cables work great. Never had any problems with them. I own several of different lengths and they all sound perfect.,positive
This product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price.  I have absolutely no complaints.  This is my first experience with the brand and I am not disappointed.,positive
"Good quality guitar cord.Very low noise, repairable, effective strain releaf,thick rubber cover!! This is a great buy, under 10 bucks for a quality cord.Of course I just got it..it might not be durable but it looks durable.If I change my mind about anything I will update my review.For now, I would say, buy one!!Joe",positive
"This is a good solid cable with no problems. When I'm on stage, I like a longer cable but at practice I don't need all the extra length tangleing up on everything...",positive
This guitar cable is very nice.  It looks high quality and has the white ends.  Fantastic deal for this cable.,positive
Good product at a good price. Have used it multiple times and works well with my guitar and speaker. Great to have when friends come over to jam.,positive
This item is well built and I like the terminal ends and how they have the spring built in. These aren't going to be the most durable road cables but for home and light road use they will work well.,positive
This amp plug is great for the price its 10 ft long the perfect size for jammin at home and it has a quality look to it aesthetically totally worth the price,positive
"Hosa Cable GTR210 Guitar Instrument Cable - 10ft. is a High quality Instrument Cable, but low cost, won't break the bank. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",positive
...unbalanced guitar cable is notoriously noisy especially around florescent lights. These are no different. I would prefer to use cables with better shielding but cannot justify the expense considering how rarely these things get used.,positive
"This is your basic, black electric guitar cable but it works great.  So far the connections at both ends are solid and the sound from the amp is great!  Nice and rubbery and 10 feet is long enough.  If problems arise later with this cable, I will update this review, but as of now there has been no problems whatsoever with this cable.",positive
"Hosa cable quality can be all over the place, some of their products are good (sound good, reliable, long lasting) and some of their products are not good (affect sound negatively, break prematurely, short useful life span).These guitar cords are actually quite nice, they feel good (gooey soft rubber jacket like Mogami), they sound good and so far they are working reliably, the rubber jacket is about .25&#34; in diameter (by eye) and there is a short heat shrink overwrap to add strength where the wire enters the plug.I bought these when I needed cables fast for an internet concert, we had lots of pedals and signal splits to connect up. These cables arrived in good working condition and we've been using them continuously since.We have over a dozen tube amps and are very particular about sound degradation but so far these cables have not disappointed anyone.I would buy more if I needed them.",positive
"It's a cable, no frills, tangles pretty easy and due to it's design it might rattle a little when you move around but it works like it should",positive
"I never really considered a cheaper cable, I was always taught to get the best I could afford. When this showed up in a cable search on amazon, I jumped on it. I figured I had nothing to lose.To my surprise, this is an excellent cable, with good build quality and a strong, thick jacket that inspires confidence. The sound through it is identical to my Monster cables, and it cost one quarter the price....hmmmm, guess I should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to &#34;snobs&#34; for so many years. I will never do that again.This is worth the money twice over, try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye!",positive
"For the price, fantastic.They do feel light and I don't trust the build quality at the key stress points (where cable meets connector), but then again I am not going to push it.Set your guitar down on it by accident when it's plugged in and...who knows.But for seven bucks it gets the job done. Recommended if you are doing the ""beginner"" thing and testing the waters.Otherwise, spend a few more bucks for something with higher chances of lasting.",positive
"Hosa makes good stuff, this is no exception. I've trusted them for years, I can't think if a single Hosa cable I've owned that's failed.",positive
"Hard to day too much, but it works great. No issues to speak of. It does the job perfectly well",positive
"For the price, this works really well. I see no faults. It can unscrew pretty easily, but this is hardly a problem right now.",positive
"This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. It's quality outweighs its price. Let's face it, a cable is a cable is a cable. But the quality of these cables can vary greatly. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. With nothing changed but the cable, there was a significant difference in quality and volume. So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good. The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential. I've seen more expensive cables and this one is (so far) great.Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft",positive
I was looking for a long cable to perform live with my band and i'm glad with HOSA quality. It feels reliable and without adding noise.,positive
"These are Good cables at a good price!! Not sure they would hold up to heavy use, but for practicing at home they are really great!",positive
"very sturdy, high quality with little to no feedback, i use it for performing for my friends and they all love it",positive
"Unless you're going to go for the very top of the line most expensive professional chords, these will do for any medium sized venue.",positive
"I have many lengths of these Hosa cables and have neverhad a problem with them.I am not an active musician, so have not put any of them throughthe riggers of what happens on stage; so I cannot comment on thistype of usage.In my over 40 years (10 of them on stage) I have come to realize, thatyou should ALWAYS have extra cables (just like strings) with you, aseven the most expensive cables will sometimes let you down.",positive
"I've been using these for about 3 weeks now - they are strong but flexible and don't seem to develop kinks or bending ""habits"" if you roll them up the proper way.I've seen and used some better cables but not at this price point.  And I've certainly seen quite a few worse!  This is a pretty good sweet spot, in my opinion.",positive
Works great on my 100 watt Amp. Almost compares to a monster cable. And with Its length Its plenty of Room from your Guitar to amp. GOOD PRODUCT!,positive
"Good cable, as good as any expensive brand. Thick, a bit stiff and seems to be shielded. No complaints at all.",positive
"It is a decent cable. It does its job, but it leaves much to be desired as far as structural integrity is concerned. The mating part of the connector jiggles back and forth. The switch is also loose. The connector will move around 2mm out of the microphone without the switch being pressed.'I would not recommend using this cable for critical applications. It would be more suited to home or hobby use.",positive
the cable is great for connecting directly to the computer microphone to record live without a console or mixer...... its great  i recomended,positive
Bought this to hook up a Beta 58 to a Panasonic G2 DSLR and a Kodak Zi8 for interviews. Works the way it's supposed to. 90 degree TRS is a nice touch. Good price.,positive
"Just received this cord and it seems to work as expected. What can you say about an adapter cord?  It is well made, good construction and sound from my DSLR with my mic is superb.",positive
"If you're like me, you probably bought this to hook up an XLR microphone to a digital recorder or a PC.It works fine for the handy type recorders.But forget hooking this directly to a PC.  Way too much noise.",positive
"I bought this for my Canon Vixia HF G10 Video Camera and a Shotgun Mic that I recently purchased for it. I needed a 12&#34; wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic (which is mounted on the Mini Advanced Shoe) to the microphone plug on the Video Camera...The wire on this thing is *not* 1 foot long. the actual wire is under 8&#34; long itself. I would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth the hassle... I'd have rated it 1 star, but I tried it on my Nikon D3200 (Shoe mounted Shotgun Mike) and it worked out ok. Still a tight fit though (since there's only 8&#34; of wire)...I'd recommend anyone looking for a short cable go with a 2' adapter; worst case scenario, you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesn't fit.Also, not sure if it's the wire (so this didn't affect stars) but I hear a hiss when recording. Again; unsure if it's the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the DSLR or not (or my shotgun mic).",positive
"Well made, XLR 3 pin adaptor to mini.  Needed to get a real XLR mic into the computer and this did the job.",positive
"First, the reasons why I awarded this five stars: the construction is uniformly excellent. Both ends have strain reliefs, the 1/8"" connecter perfectly mates with the plug into which I insert it, and the XLR end is a quality component.I purchased this specifically to transform the third channels in myPowerwerks 50 Watt Personal P.A. Systeminto something more useable. This greatly expands the functionality and versatility of the portable PA by allowing me to plug in another mic. Since I have three of those units daisychained I was able to significantly enhance the entire system with this simple adapter.Another reason why I love this is it's noise free. In some environments in which I play there are sources of electromagnetic interference that cheap cables will pick up and transmit. I have not had that problem with this one, so it's another plus.Overall I am very pleased with this adapter and actually purchased a spare in case I damage or lose my primary one. It's a bit pricier than others I considered, but I feel that the quality and peace of mind are worth the premium.",positive
I use this cable to run a extra line from microphone podiums to a zoom H1. This adapter has never failed me and has been instrumental in capturing quality audio at live events. I own several of these and love them.I highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional. Also check out Hosa's sinlge XLR to double XLR splitter.,positive
"This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats.First, it's construction is pretty light weight. That means you will have to be ""gentle"" with it when using it. That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.Second, the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable, heavy duty, and with a longer cable for the same price. It pays to shop around!",positive
"Well made. Works as it should. However, seem to be getting a little bit of noise from a shotgun mic straight into a D800. (more than the usual expected)To see if it was the Mic, cable, or adapter; Tested it going straight into a Zoom H4 recorder.Seems to be a little but more noise going through this adapter cable than straight into the XLR input.No big surprises. Minor clean up in post.",positive
"Haven't used it yet but if it's like the other cables I have from the same company, it should work fine.",positive
Great stereo sound out of the keyboards.My keys had a single 1/4&#34; stereo out so this cable was needed to get it to convert to a true 2 channel stereo so we could EQ it properly and it worked like a charm. I highly recommend this cable.,positive
"When I ordered these I wasn't expecting a whole lot since the price was under two dollars for a nearly 10-foot cable.  It turns out the quality is quite excellent and these cables are not flimsy at all.  I plugged them into the mixer and waited to hear some static, interference or buzz to explain the low price and all I got was a nice, clean signal.  Highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable.",positive
"These are solid cables -- tight fit in receptacles, no introduction of noise, and no discernible loss of signal. Especially considering the price, these are brilliant. I was like some of the reviewers wondering if such an economical cable could be any good, but I trusted their judgment and gave these a try and so count me in among those who weren't sure but have become convinced that Hosa knows how to make a great cable, and to do so without the need to charge Monster Prices.",positive
"On my mixer, I have send/returns on the same plug using a 3 wire TRS with send on the tip, return on the ring, and a common ground.  But my effects boxes like to have separate 1/4"" TR ins and outs.This is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkBehringer Shark FBQ100 Automatic Feedback Destroyerto the 1202-vlZ3's send/returnsMackie 1202-VLZ3 12-Ch. Compact Recording/SR MixerI probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send/return.",positive
"I still operate in an analog environment quite often, so I end up using lots of inserts. I have 8 channels of compression, limiter, gate and expander, plus various EQs and effects processors that need to be routed and applied to specific channels. I have an insert snake that I use as well, but the individual insert cables (of differing lengths) that I carry are lifesavers that make me a more efficient soundman during setup and a more flexible soundman during the show!",positive
"I use these in my home studio as INSERTS and they work great. No complaints.On a side note, I always clean all my cables with CAIG DeoxIT Gold G5 Spray Contact Conditioner 5 oz.and hightly recommend it to all musicians, you will hear the differnce. I also spray a q-tip and and clean all the jacks on my guitars and instruments.",positive
"When you need an audio insert cable, you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs, such as mixer cases with processing gear, it's simply not cost effective, and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands, but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation, while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product, Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price, Amazon!",positive
I play my I-pod through a small guitar Amp.  Great way to wake up the kids.  Works perfectly for the purpose.  Keep in mind small end for I-Pod is stereo and large end that goes into amp in mono.  If needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else.,positive
"I bought a few of these to hook iPods/iPhones to live stage sound systems, most of which are not in stereo anyway, so why use stereo-to-mono adapters or 2 separate channels when it's not needed? Perfect solution, seems durable.",positive
"This is what it is... A super cheap mono cable. It should be sufficient for many needs and is cheap enough that thin wire gauge and such can be forgiven. Just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded, etc.For the price and intent, I almost gave it 5 stars. But it's not a 5-star cable... It's a fair quality ultra cheap cable. 4 stars seems about right. (Yes, this is almost exactly what I wrote about the other Hosa cable I reviewed.)",positive
"Cables are cables. They usually all work. And with Amazon, you will always find the best deals for the same quality.",positive
"Picked up a cable to test on my new pedalboard, and I couldn't be happier. Doesn't suck tone, cables are sturdy, and they sound great. This replaced a normal straight 1/4 inch cable and saves so much space on my board.",positive
"This L Jack is good enough to make connections between my guitar pedals and it works fine. Flexible enough. I don't like only the fact that it's made out of plastic and it looks cheap, but for the price i paid for it i don't really care.",positive
"These little patch cables work nicely, there's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine..I'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5. The product description says 6 inches, right? If you jump over to these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PGXKC8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) planet waves patch cables they're listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches, right?) The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches, whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another. I only used the Hosa cable as an emergency back up.To conclude, would I recommend these? Yes, if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable, go for these. But my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else.",positive
"If you need some 6"" cables to connect your pedals, look no farther. These cables are perfect. They deliver good sound, are very small, and very cheap. What more could you ask for?!",positive
Bought this Hosa Pedal Cable for our son to interconnect his guitar pedal. It works well and seems to be durable. It hasn't given him any problems so far. It doesn't appear to change the sound quality or tone. Great product.,positive
"Good little connector cable.  Well constructed, durable, built to last.  I would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes. Worth it.",positive
"These are great cables. The only con I could give is if they go bad...no opening up the ends to fix them, but in my experience they are durable. Most people are using these on a pedal board so there's not a lot of movement to wear them down.",positive
"Works just fine, great for little spaces between one pedal to another, if there's more distance, better use another type, bue generally works fine and it's a good quality product, clean signal no problems",positive
These are great patch cables especially for the price. They don't suck any tone they are reliable(I've had mine for 2 years)and are really great for players on a budget.,positive
"these cable came super fast in the mail, They deliver the level of performance you would expect form low cost cables. they work",positive
This is a very good cable. I don't forsee having any problems with it. It's just right for hooking my pedals together eithout the mesws of long cables. If you need this get it. The price is right and shipping was right on time.,positive
"This is not the fanciest cable you can buy, but it fits my low budget.  It works perfectly, it doesn't feel like its going to break anytime soon, and my pedals are perfectly connected.",positive
I typically use planet waves cables but tried these and there just as great. Never an issue. No loss of tone. Never breaks or fails. Quality product for a good price.,positive
"Really just some inexpensive and yet durable cables to link your stompboxes together. As of yet, i havent had one go all crackly, which, considering they get frequent use, is pretty good. Often, cheap cords die within a year or so. Every electric guitarist keeps a stock of these things, and this one in particular is cheap and accessible. I probably have around twelve of them.Enjoy!",positive
Hosa patch cables are the best for the buck. Great sound and flexible. I'm a firm Hosa cable fan. Love these little guys.,positive
These have a lower profile and can fit and bend into the places the ones with thick metal ends can't.,positive
"I bought 6 of these XLR to 1/4&#34; adapters hoping to connect my microphones to an old funky mixer I owned with 1/4&#34; inputs.  It didn't end up working because I discovered I needed to convert the microphone level to line level (which these don't do), however they do convert XLR to 1/4&#34; balanced quite well.  Just not what I needed in my particular situation.",positive
"I use this adapter on the interface/mix board end of 1 channel of my XLR cable snake, to change 1 channel into my monitor return. I plug an XLR to Female 1/4"" stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup. Now I can record with 6 channels, and monitor with 2. (It's an 8 channel XLR snake). Why do I go through all that you ask? because I have an 8 channel XLR snake, and instead of buying another snake, why not ADAPT the snake I have? hence the word adapter... :-P I love it. It's a great tool to add versatility to your setup, no matter what you're doing. Definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an XLR to balanced 1/4"" stereo... It's high quality, and very solid, I definately expect this to last me a long time.",positive
"I purchased this to work with my ION system and my shure mic. Arrived as expected, very solid great fit. It works!!!!",positive
This has come in handy many times in my studio Z108.net. We love having it around. Good quality affordable price.,positive
"This converts an xlr signal (for me, a Shure SM57 mic) into a 1/4 male (I run it into a guitar pedalboard and then an amp).  Have no issues with performance but the converter is a little bulky especially once you clip a mic onto that.  Could be tight fitting into certain places on a pedalboard but works great overall.",positive
Its affordable and it works.  Its a nice little adapter for your low impedance cable to your high impedance input.,positive
"I bought this XLR splitter to split the lead vocal from FOH to my monitor rack.  Used this way it worked great and I never had any problems with signal loss or power issues.  I began using a transformer isolated XLR splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter.  My only issue with the Hosa Y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short, so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when I plugged it into our lead singer's microphone.  It would be great on a guitar mic or something that's close to the ground, or horizontally placed, but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand.",positive
As expected from Hosa another great product.  Solid construction and great sound reproduced.  i would recomed this product to everyone.,positive
"I use this to run a single, mono XLR shotgun mic line to two audio channels on my Tascam DR-40, which saves me a step in post-production.  The quality is fine and it does what it's supposed to do.  Good price for a good product.",positive
"If I didn't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldn't do it, plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I can't find in RadioShack, Best Buys no where else, I have done a lot of Purchasing not just for myself, but for business. These Ladies and Gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way, I would like to apply for a position with them.Regards,ffsalsa",positive
"This is a solid product. I ended up not needing it so... I returned it. However, it worked fine and gets the job done.",positive
"This Dual splitter works perfect. I own a live event video company and I shoot a lot of weddings. The most important part of video is the audio. you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal. I always say, half of video is audio. For years I used to run a line directly out of the DJ's mixer to get my audio. The issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking. Often though, the signal is to hot, the music is crap, or the dj says something stupid. With just the DJ's voice I can edit the way I want and compress time. This product has improved my productions beyond it's price sold. I use them to run a separate clean audio line from a DJ's wireless systems to my own audio recorder. They work perfectly and haven't failed me once.",positive
"This was recommended to me by the top engineer at Genz-Benz bass amplification company.  Andy said that this product is far superior to any other.  He was right.  Fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my Shuttle 6.0 amp.  Also fixed the effects loop jacks, which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90% of its power on gigs.  Not good!  After several gigs worth of testing, both problems are resolved!  Andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating, cleaning and coating effect on the components.  Wow!  And no, Andy does not own stock in, have affiliation with, or represent in any way the manufacturers of De-Oxit.  Nor do I.",positive
"This thing is like a magic Spray! Hah!Seriously... I used this on noisy hinges, car doors, etc.I really bought it to clean the POTs (volume controls and knobs) on my Guitars, pedals and equipment. It really does work and gets rid of the static noise you get when you turn your volume control on your radio or guitar for example.",positive
"I bought this product to use on my amp pots. It restored the sound,power and clearity of my amps.It doesn't evaporate right away, but after a couple of minutes your good to go!",positive
"Back in the 1980's I bought a can of deoxit(not the right name but can't remember it) which worked much better and cost much less. It was made for the military. The spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high. It does work but the stuff I used to have was much better. I don't see much else out there so I may have to stick with it.It is just very wasteful for the cost. I have had good luck with wd40 too, but it is very flammable. I would call it average.",positive
"Before you pay some tech to fix the knobs and switches on your guitar, stomp box or amp, try this.  95% of the time, this will take care of the problem.  If your amp cuts in and out, also try spraying the effects loop and pushing a 1/4&#34; jack in and out of the socket a dozen times.  The very first can I bought probably paid for itself a hundred times over.  Good stuff !",positive
"I deal with quite a bit of electronic musical instrument gear from guitars, basses, amps, FX, MIDI gear, etc.  Over time most of it starts suffering from scratchy / noisy pots (knobs), input and output jacks that are crackly, etc.In the past I've tried some Locktite electronics cleaner, which is provided in a similar can. It would rarely work.In contrast this has cleaned every piece of gear I've used it on saving me from having to physically replace the pots and jacks. It's really like magic in a can.",positive
"This stuff works great and is well worth the price, I used it to clean the pots on several guitars and a bass amp along with various effect pedals, no more scratchiness, no more jarring volume spikes, all my knobs glide now better than the day they were new, I'll always keep a can of this around, nothing more to say, great stuff.",positive
Fantastic stuff....I sprayed it in my bass guitar's pot and now its like new. Wish I had found this stuff sooner.,positive
"What was it, brillcream? a dab will do ya?Something like that -This is all you need for contact cleaning. Worth the coin.",positive
I've got an old mesa boogie that has developed scratchy controls over the years.This stuff cleaned most of them out pretty well but my midrange pot is starting to crackle again.I hate to tear the chassis out again but it'd gotta happen,positive
"The pots on my bass has become &#34;scratchy&#34; so I sprayed a bit into them, turn the pots back and forth a few times and no more noise. Great for what I needed.",positive
"For the money, this karaoke mic does a decent job for any vocal use. Good to keep as a spare in the gig box.",positive
"i was truly surprised when i saw how nice it was, has weight to it ,and has good sound , looks nicely made,very good deal for the money,,can't go wrong,, (not a very cheep made microphone ,, MUCH BETTER THEN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ! ) its nice,",positive
"The only reason I give 4 stars is because I ordered 2 of these and 1 had the chord with it and one was missing the chord... I ordered both at the same time, other than that they are good hot mics...",positive
"As a freelancer, I occasionally work with a band that plays the Midwest, performing on a near-weekly basis.  These are seasoned veterans who have no interest in gear per se and even less interest in brand cachet.  It's all about money to them.  I couldn't believe it when I first saw the group using these Nady mics (even lower-priced several years ago) and insisting they were as good as Shure SM-57's and 58's.  I still don't believe the quality of workmanship compares (any casual empirical test of build quality will prove as much).  But these Nady's handle the announcing, the vocals, and, when needed, the softer sounding instruments (flute, harmonica), and none has broken or quit on my watch.I'm a keyboardist, so mic power and fidelity don't affect me.  I'm only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the all-important ""gear component.""  At the same time, my embarrassment, I confess, is not unmixed with a bit of demonic glee.  After all, who's playing--and getting paid for it?",positive
We bought this mic after seeing how our grandson was handling the mic that came with the karaoke machine thinking that mic would not last very long.  I hope it does because this nady sp-4c is a very impressive mic for the price.  We our using it with our Roland cm30 cube and plan to use it with a Roland micro cube also.  I would have given it 5 stars if the cord connection to the mic was not a little loose.,positive
"I bought this cable for my band's live show setup.  I bought it almost a year ago and still currently use it for the same application.  While not the best quality cable, the length and price make it a good value for the money, especially if you're buying several at a time.  I don't use these cables in the studio but for live, they're fine.  I'd recommend this cable if you're on a budget and looking to buy several at a time.  If you're only going to buy one, I'd look into Canare or Mogami, they're a little bit more expensive but easy to get and worth the price.",positive
If they're used for live performances they will not last very long! Good for the price. I need to resolder the ends after a concert though.,positive
"There's nothing complicated about this purchase. It's a cable. It works. It doesn't cost a lot. It's a great deal. Get it.I use it every week, and it still sounds perfect. Then, again, I never mistreat my equipment.",positive
"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables, and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g., running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell, and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them, and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies, so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all.",positive
I've had this cable for awhile and I'm not too impressed with the quality. The plug and jack look cheap and the cable is thin. I use it at home on a practice mic and it hasn't had much of a workout. I don't think it would hold up long on stage at a venue.,positive
"The Gain on this mic isn't the greatest, but for speeches and soft recordings: this guy can handle it all very well!",positive
"I have a few Shure SM58s which cost more.  I like the open sound of the PG48 but vocals seem to break up more at higher volumes than they do with the SM58s.  I like this mic ok but the SM58 is worth the extra money I think, especially if you expect to push its capability.",positive
I only do test recording with this digitally to get a better Idea of my learning process from the other side. It gives a clean crisp reproduction of every flaw I have.,positive
"I use this for Video Exchanges on a guitar instruction website. It's perfect for vocals, podcasting, video recording and so forth. Shure makes excellent stuff. What's also great is you save some money as an XLR cable is included. I'm very happy with this purchase.",positive
"4 stars instead of 5 only because this thing won't tune your guitar or carry your amp. I use this solo, in a duo with a bass player, in a trio with drums and bass. I have a regular gig at a medium sized club that is basically one large room. I use it through a Pyle Pro self contained Pa into which I also plug my Martin GRP elec/acoustic. The sound quality is excellent. The volume seems limited only bny what the Pyle Pro will put out. I would have no hesitation using this for bigger rooms with a full band and PA. I haven't heard a hint of feedback and the on/off switch is a plus.The 36.99 price might seem to good to be true but think of the things for which we are paying less for than we used to. I bought a 32&#34; Toshiba flat screen for around 230 bucks, Think of what that would have cost even five years ago or less. The same is true of a lot of Audio Gear. A lot of companies are bringing high quality elctronics and music to the market but it's great to have a company like Shure make something so good and so affordable. They have always made a high quality product and now they have one that almost anyone can afford. I cannot recommend it strongly enough.",positive
"So far, I'm very happy with this Microphone. Tone quality is fine and does everything I need it to do for backup vocals in my band. Although a longer cable would be nice, it's great a cable and was included in the package.",positive
"It is so hard to get an honest review of any mike that isn't a Shure SM58. This is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured. Of course at least part of this reputation is deserved, but perhaps more for the durability of the SM58 than its sound. I have a couple of SM58s and a couple of PG58s. I was considering the SM48, but the PG58 has slightly better specs, and almost identical price.The first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier. It also has a different switch than the SM58. The metal screens protecting them aren't interchangeable. I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical. I tried both mikes, one after the other, first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar, and then I changed the settings, or more specifically, the effects and the EQ on the PA. I repeated the experiment, speaking and then singing while changing between mikes.Here's what I noticed: The SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid range. The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence. They are about equal on volume. The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone controls. Neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop.I haven't tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice, as it's too time consuming and interferes with playing. It's difficulty to judge in those situations too, or at least awkward, but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference, except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58, but that could be just the settings.I looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side. The SM58 is a little flatter in response, especially at the high end, over 10K Hz, and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58, somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz. However, since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 Hz, neither of these seems likely to have much effect, although the SM58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singer.I also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike. The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures, sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity. These mikes sound almost identical (The B 2000 and the Shure SM). The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued, though, and replaced with the 1800XM, an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50.I then plugged in a Radio Shack mike that was a spare backup, not even taken out for practice. The model number is 33-3001, probably also discontinued. This was an excellent sounding mike, with good volume, presence and tone.I didn't have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment, but I did reach some conclusions:There is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones, with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard. They ARE sturdy, and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable, at around $100. However, there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable, at lower prices, including the Shure PG58, and most likely the SM48, though I didn't have any of those to test.I wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer. I'm giving this 4 stars only because I haven't had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the SM58.",positive
This microphone is great for singing with a PA and an electric guitar. I sing worship/praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely. I don't think it is the same as an SM58 but it is exactly what I need. Built to last and it is a Shure.,positive
"Just got this, have used it for recording and rehearsal, it works well so far and I will revise the review if that somehow changes in the next few years.  Right now, though, I'd say great product.",positive
"I bought this one to replace a Shure 8900. It's a big step up from that one. I am pleased with it. The old one had a lot of handling noise. This one has a little but it is very good for the money I paid for it. My next one will be an SM58, but that will be awhile from now. I'm very happy with this PG58.Update:December 2012The handling noise is definitely something to consider. It would keep me from buying another one of these. Other mics I own don't have this problem to this degree.",positive
"I started with the Shure PG58 and most recently acquired the Shure SM58.  I'd probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a Neumann or Telefunken mic costing 5 G's simply isn't that much better than a Nady mic costing 10 bucks.  But with respect to the Shure, I'm less sure that the SM58 isn't worth 40% more than the PG58.  Perhaps if you have a sufficiently high-powered and ""clean"" amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice, the two mics could be mistaken for one another.  It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency P.A. that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58.  Switching to the more common, admittedly more expensive mic, gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements).P.S. I notice that the head of the PG58 is larger than that of the SM58.  Since the rise of the ""digital audio workstation"" (who doesn't have a computer with free, included Garage Band on it?), large, even gold-plated, expensive-looking but cheap mics are on display all over the place.  Despite appearances, when it comes to mics, size doesn't matter--except for appearances (directors of high school show bands will dispense those headsets that wrap half-way around the face, knowing that the girls in the front-line think they're cool--they look just like Madonna'a or Janet's headgear). Some of the best mics are tiny, with an opening the size of a pin-hole.",positive
good mic for simple live stuff that isn't too expensive.  it gets a good clear sound and has an on off switch that helps with all kinds of things,positive
This is a proven classic.  Using it to mic my Mesa Boogie Mark V 1x12 cabinet.  Sounds fantastic and is solidly built.,positive
"This is the #1 mic you should get, recording or live, instruments or voice, it always come through  with a great sound and seems almost indestructible.looking forward to work with it on future projects, can't believe it took me so long to get one of those",positive
"Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic, that was not always the case and I've actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a ""Shure Model 545 Unidyne III.""  That mic got stolen about 2 years ago, but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an on/off switch function.  I've owned or used countless modern day SM-58's and SM-57's along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers.  I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I don't need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57.  To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away.  I'd only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive.  By design the SM-58's require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57's.  I prefer the SM-57's over the SM-58's for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end.  The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled.  The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic I've ever used.  If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58.  If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals I'd recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it.  That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57.  The SM-57 will pop like mad without one.  The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days.  I can't find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere.  However, if you've ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability. For my money, the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes.  For studio vocals I'd use an SM-7, which really doesn't sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like.  The SM-57 and it's predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable.  You can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen.",positive
"Good all around mike. If you are looking for a solid mike to start your studio, I recommend this one. Best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals. Best mike for the price and purpose.",positive
"Seriously?  The Shure SM57 sets the standard, which by all other instrument microphones are judged.No kidding.  They work great with guitar (for a REAL acoustic guitar sound, drums, congas, tablas... You name it..  if it's an instrument the SM57 delivers.I hear it's good for vocals as well.  When the President gives a speech, the SM57 is there.In my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the SM57.  The SM58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's).For instrument sound reinforcement...  bar-none... the best.",positive
"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums, its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor, PG seies, digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure.",positive
"There's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these (and if it doesn't, it should).  This is a great all purpose dynamic mic, I use it for instruments, vocals, even field recording sometimes.  The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals, but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned, and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably, then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon, but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics, you can't go wrong here.",positive
I use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets. It works as well as most mics and is more durable than most. I have used this in the studio when nothing else was available and it worked fine. As long as I run sound for a living I will keep some of these mics.,positive
"Considering that the SM57 was introduced to the world in 1967, a year after the Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone, I guess the 58 gets Batman status, relegating the 57 to that of Robin. But that's not really a fair assessment considering the 57 and 58 were developed at the same time, and except for the 58's acoustic foam lined cage pop screen, the two mics are identical electrically.The SM (Studio Microphone) 57 was designed to begin it's life in a recording studio, as a dynamic microphone used to mic the ever increasing volume of rock and roll amplifiers, drum kits, etc. In that capacity, it had no use for the pop screen of it's cousin the SM58, still one of the most sold vocal mics in the world to this day. So the SM57 slimmed down and even though it's still a fine vocal mic, you'll see it used mostly mic'ing instruments, which it excels at.One of it's long time and most important roles has been the official podium mic for the White House. A pair of SM57's is always seen on various White House podiums for press conferences and there is even a VIP bundled kitShure SM57 VIP Dual Microphone Kityou can buy for this exact type of use.The SM57 is an extremely rugged mic, built to tough standards and can take lots of road abuse. That's one of the things that makes it popular with touring bands and sound companies. And on top of that, it's just a great sounding mic for the price.There is a Performer SeriesShure Beta 57A Microphonethat looks very similar to the SM57 but the Beta 57 has a different mic capsule and transformer and sounds different. So make sure you try before you buy.Bottom line is the Shure SM57 is one tough road mic that sounds awesome and is not overly priced. A best value for sound companies, home studio recordists and touring musicians.",positive
"I use this for recording guitars as well as live vocals.  I've knocked this microphone around a decent amount, and it is plenty rugged.  I couldn't be happier with it.",positive
"I bought this for my teen son for Christmas. He loves to play his bass and sing along. He had a different Shure mic and it was totally flat compared to this particular model. Nice and clean sounds, plus it seems pretty sturdy. We did get him a mic stand and it fits on it perfectly and stays put. Shure knocked this one out of the park.",positive
"The industry standard for live performance, the SM58 has withstood the test of time and for good reason. These are the only microphones that I perform with, and the on/off switch makes it easier so I don't have to power down all of my gear when I am done practicing...I just turn the mic off.",positive
"It is not a bad mic for the price ( If you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over 600 bucks) but it is no comparison to a studio mic since I have worked in a recording studio. Now, you need to decide what you want, getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for; it is like having HD TV and BD player but playing an ordinary CD. You would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer, speakers and so on. If you are a home or hobby user, then go for this mic. This mic is quite good for its price. I would probably say, it exceeds your expectations.Arrived as promised in a frustration free packing. Also, make sure you buy a foam mic hood for the mic to save it from unwanted dirt and spit.The only reason I did not give 5 stars is , mine had a little dent on the body ( may be due to transportation) but it has nothing to do with the function but just the looks.",positive
"How do you review an SM58?? I've used these most of my life, and will continue to. Very durable, I got this to replace the same, a 20 year old, rusted / dented grill 58 :) I also use a D5 (AKG - same price) and a line 6 wirelesss, but the 58 is always reliable first choice or backup.",positive
"The first rule of microphones is that, ""No one microphone is perfect for every purpose.""  Rule two is, ""Experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound.""  I've used Shure SM58's along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968.  I primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but I have used (and still do use) them for singing some back up vocals.The SM58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use.  Some people, me included, actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic, the Shure SM-57.  The SM-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice.  For example, anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the SM-58.  People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM-58.The SM-58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect (which means the bass increases the closer you get.)  This mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away.  The reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type Shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they don't sound right.  On the other hand, the SM-57 sounds best several inches away from the user's mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away.  While the SM-58 is certainly the number one professional PA vocal mic, there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly.  It works ok for conga drums and the like, but the SM-58 is about the last thing you'd want to use to mic a sax or guitar.  Personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice, but for some people they sound great.  The live vocal mic that works best for me is the Shure SM-57 with a windscreen.  However for other people the SM-58 works better.  It depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do.  If you have a very deep voice, the SM-58 might be the second best choice after the SM-57 which has a better low frequency response.One certain advantage of the SM-58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability.  This mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying PA squeal.  Another advantage of the SM-58 is that it is still available (at a slight extra cost) with a built-in on/off switch.  The SM-58's ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars.  I've seen SM-58's dented, rusty, dusty, smoked up, spit into, with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet I've never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on/off switch that got dirt in it.All the pro-line Shure mics are top quality.  The pro line Shures also hold their value well.  If you buy one and decide you don't like it, you can get about what you paid for it on eBay.  I would compare as many mics as possible before buying one.  Senneheiser's EVOLUTION mics sound really good too and are worth a look. The SM-58 will be the number one on-stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice.  These things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today they'd still be around for another 20 years at least.",positive
"legendary performance indeed! works perfectly, extremely easy to set up, very good sound, good price, that's 'bout all you need to know!",positive
"Great all around mic used for vocals.  No frills, tough as nails, and great sound for live music.  If you're buying your first mic (or switching from a cheapie) and intend to use it for singing/vocals, this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation.  I've never used another one since the first time I switched from a cheaper mic (that came with some bundle) 10 years ago.  I depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds I like perfectly.  You can stand 3 feet away and really wail, or get up close for some bass response, or anything in between.The SM58-CN comes with the mic, 25-ft cable, cable tie, carry pouch, and mic clip.  The standard SM58 does not have a switch (one less thing to break and I don't miss it)  but the SM58-S does have it for a few dollars extra.",positive
"I've just got the Shure SM58 microphone.As expected, this is a real workhorse of microphones; the sound is clear, crispy, robust, high quality product.Also, I've bought it at Amazon and they sold through J&R; Music and Computer World which is an excellent supplier. They shipped in less time than expected.I'm a really happy customer now.",positive
no complaints here! the quality is great! the sounds is excellent! and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp. use it all the time.,positive
A nice addition to my recording home studio!  I recommend it for any one who records ballads or light classical music.,positive
This mic works better for some people than others. That being said it is the first mic I put in a lead singers hand upon meeting them. If it doesn't sound good then I try something else. I have no complaints it is my GO TO MIC.,positive
"I bought two microphones, a AKG D5 and SM58.  I like AKG D5 a little better than this because the vocal sounded a lot clearer and crisp on the AKG.The SM sounded muted compared to D5 without any sound modification out of box.  The output is also a little less sensitive than the D5.However I like the look of SM58 and it seems to be extremely durable.",positive
"In the immortal words that John Cameron Swayze used when hawking his Timex watches during the early days of live television, the Shure SM58 Vocal mic fits perfectly into that same category.Before I found a career as a film and television sound recordist and mixer, I played in rock bands and did live sound mixing. One of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the SM58. Introduced by the Shure Brothers Company in 1966, the SM58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructible.The mic capsule is of cardiord (heart shaped) design which helps reject sound from either side. There is a 4K bump in it's frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise. Construction is rugged, frequency response is 50 to 15,000 Hz, and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noise.We used to joke about the SM58 in that if you needed a hammer and you couldn't find one, just grab one of these, they are that tough. I've seen some of these on the road that you couldn't believe still worked, but they did and sounded great.The cage style pop screen gives the SM58 not only it's distinctive look, one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced, but it's part of the functionality. Internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam, the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element. As a frame of reference, theShure SM57LC Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic Microphoneis the same exact mic and capsule, but without the pop screen.Shure also sells a Performer series mic, theShure Beta 58A Supercardioid Dynamic Microphonethat looks almost identical to the SM58 but uses a totally different mic capsule and transformer and has a different sound so try before you buy.The Shure SM58 is still considered the industry standard of live performance mics today and for the price, they really are a good deal.",positive
"I made the mistake of thinking I could save forty bucks and get by with the Shure PG-58.  I'm no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp (rather than a P.A.). Whatever the reason, the PG-58 simply doesn't have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the Roland Cube / Peavey amps I try to employ it with (I use a 1/4"" adapter with the XLR connector that comes with the mic).  When I borrow a Shure SM-58 mic from someone, the difference is instant and dramatic--it's a far more efficient (i.e. louder) mic, producing a full, clear sound, and without additional pre-amplification, demonstrating why it's the most popular microphone in the world.  For five bucks extra, I can't fathom a reason for avoiding the SM-58S, the version with an on-off switch.  It's a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick-up of ""private"" comments by indiscreet band members.  And even if you're an instrumentalist, it may be wiser to select the SM-58 over the SM-57.  The former mic is a little more ostentatious, but it's also slightly more adaptable, and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non-musical sounds. Above all, the SM-58 has proven itself to be the Sherman tank of microphones, simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability.[I see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of ""this seller.""  Perhaps a good point unless it's in reference to Amazon Prime, which is the Shure SM-58 of commerce: competitive prices, no postage, easy returns.  But anyone who returns an SM58 probably had no business buying it in the first place.  They are the populous drones of the industry, invariably purchased by professionals who know first-hand what they're getting--reliability and virtual indestructibility.  In fact, it's the very popularity of the SM58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators.  Consumers require choice, but with the Shure SM58 there need be none.]",positive
There are plenty of flashier - prettier - modern-er looking or more nostalgic looking microphones out there.  Its all just so much marketing garbage. These mics are the best mic for the buck out there.  Anyone who claims to be able to tell the difference between this and far more expensive ones is blowing smoke up your a**.,positive

"I use this cable for small home recording projects. I do not take the cable around to gigs or shows, as I am pretty sure it wouldn't last longer than a few months of heavy use.

"Everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another.  I have a personal preference for the XLR ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside (first to slide down the cable) with a 4 legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters.  Unfortunately that design isn't used here, but I chose to award the 5 star rating for value because you get 15' of good quality shielded cable with 2 XLR ends (M and F) for well under $1/ft.As for pinout it's straightforward, pin 1 is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends, while pins 2 and 3 are run isolated between both ends.  The end design chosen uses the single set screw connector (the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart) and the rubber bumper design on the back which I haven't had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with, however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer's kit because they will be used not if but WHEN the need arises.Another favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite XLR ends mentioned above, which amazon will rush you:GLS Audio 3ft Patch Cable Cords - XLR Male To XLR Female Black Cables - 3' Balanced Snake Cord - 6 PACK- these are very easy to open an end, change phase, lift ground, or input someone's oddball source signal.  Having 6 on hand means you won't quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix.Back to pyle's product here, I basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and re-wire XLRs but gave them a star for value in the product since it's 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot.  It's also great when someone yells ""it's too short I need a cable stretcher at the podium!"" and quickly adds 15 feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn't planned for or got moved/quit working.  For the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing.I finally equipped my cable kit with the usual XLR to  RCA, 1/4 TRS, hi-z transformers, and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the XLR terminals if need be, plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems, and a roll of gaffer's tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards.  I used to have 2ea 50 foot XLR cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now I have one left for my kit. With all that I had to build an emergency XLR to 2.5mm TS all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin.  Even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on, so a bit of ""what if"" thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner's daugher's toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic.My last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made.  It will no doubt be needed again, and since you made it you'll know why, how, and where it was used before, thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem.  People think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position.  My only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn't serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted XLR 4 pin stereo Y splitter to dual TRS female cable I made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry.  I chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal, wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when I setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that (stereo) channel in rehersal at the console.",positive
This is a great chord for anyone needing to not spend the money on a high quality chord... It's no PEAVEY but it works just as good...,positive
"The product feels a little on the ""cheap"" side, but definitely does the job the way it should- so that's all I care about. It was cheap, and came fast. I recommend it.",positive
I bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine.  There doesn't seem to be any noise and they seem to be built to last.  They do what they're supposed to do.,positive
"This was one of two I purchased. Also bought the 25' Length and used them on an assignment recently.  They fit my RODE Mic nice and tight, other cords I have bought didn't and the sound quality is excellent. If Amazon allowed a link I would give you a link to a video I just finished on the Independence of the Seas.  Go to my website and look for it...IPA IMPRESS dot Com",positive
"Not much to say other than it's a good cable. Good solid connections with no play. After consistent use, it's going strong.",positive
"No complaints, it's quiet enough and the price is right. Is it a Monster cable? No, but it doesn't cost as much either. I've used this on lead vocal tracks into a studio condensor mic for professional album sessions and it was fine.",positive
well made and the perfect length for my needs. the shielding was great as well. the end connectors were well made and strong.,positive
"I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps. This requires, of course, the addition of a 1/4 inch adapter plug. The cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues. Recommended.UPDATE: I marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what I regarded as relatively light duty. The set screw fell out and could not be found. I've had similar problems with other Pyle products. If you buy them, I recommend tat you get a micro-screwdriver set as well so that you can tighten te connector screws before you have a similar xperience.",positive
"Like most products on the market, depending on where and how the item is used, your experience may vary. For me, this cable is going to be used on a semi-stationary mic stand in my project studio, and thus far, it's done nothing but an exceptional job. I tested the cable with a few different mics and in each scenario, the signal was just as strong as the some of the other, more pricey cables out there. Would I purchase this again? Absolutely!",positive
"The extra length gives me more flexibility and maneuverability.  Cord works well and hasn't been any problem, to date.  Plugs directly to the system, or my mini-amp.  Works well.",positive
"I have to tell you guys, these XLR cables that I have received recently are by far the best quality cables I have ever encountered in my entire music (professional) life.I would suggest these cables to any one of my colleagues.",positive
Got a packet to try but I found they are better than the Gator screws that came with my case! My equipment is very secure. Highly recommended.,positive
Good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment.  Arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice.,positive
Excellent rack screws with washers. Its fit very good to rack holes. Good presentation and well packed. I will buy again.,positive
So far the ones I have used have all threaded nicely into our 16u rack. There are exactly as described and do the job. What more can a guy say about a little box of screws? Maybe I should post some pics of the little buggers in action?,positive
"Pros:* They look very nice.* They cause much less wear than the 2nd hand rack screws and washers.Cons:* More expensive and I had to wait a few days longer than it took my rack equipment to ship.I'd purchase these again, but I now have 25 but only need 16 at the most once my rack is filled.",positive
"I replaced all the stock mounting screws that came with our sound rack cabinet with these, as they were nearly invisible with the black rails and mounting plates. The plastic washers also seem to protect the finishes better than metal washers on the equipment I mounted. Inexpensive, and worth it.",positive
"Donr be fooled by the imitations... should be their slogan. There are some real junky ones out there and these are great, love the washers, life savers. Thanks!",positive
"Great rack mount screws. Rubber washers are perfect, lets it give your item that tight fit without worry of the screws working out any time soon. I use them on my portable desktop rack with my mobile DJ equipment and they have held strong.",positive
"Other than that, when you need 10-32 rack screws, these are the real McCoy.  Wide enough pan to grab the ear, narrow enough to clear that next piece of gear!  Thanks, Raxxess!",positive
"There are other rack screws out there, but Raxxess makes the best quality screws and soft washers available.",positive
Well if this review survives the censors just know that these are great screws when you run out of the original screws you were supplied with your new rack.  They work.,positive
"Mics are like pants, you have to find the right fit. This one I like for my vocals live. I sing fairly low and airy - works great for me. Also used to mic resonator guitar through a tube mic preamp live, very sweet sound. I prefer it to the 58, seems a bit more bright and natural. Might purchase another one eventually...",positive
Why drive a Pinto when you can drive a Cadillac? This is the industries best mic as far as I am concerned. I had a Shure SM 58 like everyone else owned but there is no comparison between this mic and a SM58. SM 58 is garbage compared to the Beta 58A. Spring for the extra bucks and be happy. That's what I always say.,positive
"I have one of these, as well as several other microphones. The SM58 is a good all around mic - the reason it's an industry standard/go-to, but the Beta 58A is a better (in my opinion) vocal-specific mic...basically giving (again, in my opinion) a higher quality sound. The SM58 by comparison sounds muffled/muddy, where the Beta58A is clearer, stronger, and more articulate. If you're used to the SM58, then the Beta58A can sound thin and harsh, but, that is adjustable at the board - end result is that it's a tighter sounding mic with more clarity.Pattern-wise, it does better at rejecting unwanted sounds - I play drums and use this mic for that reason, is that it picks up less of my drums than a SM57 or a SM58.",positive
"Yes, it costs considerably more than the SM58 and I'm not sure if I could pass a comparison test between the two, but I love this mic!  To me, it sounds slightly brighter and clearer than the 58s I have used in the past.  If you are a musician who is strapped for cash or trying to make ends meet, get the 58.  If you have the extra dough and want a confidence boost, go for the Beta.  I would buy this again.",positive
"I'm an amateur sound tech. We've been using SM58 in our church for years now and our singers/song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we've had before. Our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this Beta58A because of the good reviews. When I received it I cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah.. For me, it sounded better than SM58. My songleaders have tested it and guess what... they dont want to use the SM58 anymore :)",positive
"While the Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone seems to be the running staple for live performance vocals, and rightly so due to its comparative value and amazing quality in sound and craftsmanship, the Beta 58A needs to be given its due. The Beta 58A is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin. That is, the Beta 58A, in the confined live scenarios in which I have utilized it, has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues. For vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high (or, really, any) notes the Beta is a dream. This same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or ""popping"" complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it.While I wish that I had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon, I can confidently say that the Beta 58A is the best vocals microphone that I have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment. Quite honestly, I would not be at all surprised if the Beta compared well even in confined recording situations. The bottom line is that the Beta 58A might be more expensive than its popular cousin, the SM58, but it is worth every penny. Anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority. Six out of five stars!",positive
"The Beta 58A along with the original SM58 are industry standards, that's well known. As a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there. Quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their go-to house mics. In fact, I noticed Betas all over the place at a small theater (with a high-end system) that I played at just recently.I had used the old 58 for years before moving to the Beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two. The Beta is definitetly hotter, with a more sensitive response. Your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to. Mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll-off to avoid that boomy, muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close. You definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight. This is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected.""Built like a tank"" is probably a bit overused when describing products but Shure's vocal mics truly earn that title. They can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter. Toss it around, drop it, bury it under other stuff, etc., NO problem. When you are maintaining a bunch of music gear, it's nice to have tools that you never worry about. For that reason, I'd highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal. Chances are, its in working order no matter what.",positive
"I actually replaced a BOSS TR2 with this pedal. Does everything it is supposed to do without the ""perceived"" (that's was they say) volume loss typical of many tremolo pedals. If it's perceived, then how do you explain how good this sounds? I have since had the pedal rehoused in a metal enclosure with a better switch because I was scared of breaking its plastic housing when switching it on and off.",positive
"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Dano stomp boxes.  I probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make.  This pedal does a decent job covering your tremolo needs, but IMHO the tremolo from Dano's Cool Cat line is a much more durable pedal for only $4 more (at the time of this review).  The switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link.  I don't think it's true bypass either.  The Cool Cat has a metal enclosure, true bypass, sturdier inputs and knobs, and a much better on/off switch.  The features and sound are the same.  Spend the extra $4 and you will have a much more bullet-proof pedal with the Cool Cat trem.",positive
"Hey, it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several ""cheapo"" pedals, and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic), at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound, not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough, it doesn't take up much space, it sounds great, and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND, if you are like the typical musician, you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank.",positive
"When I first started setting up my little studio, I wanted something that didn't break the budget.  I tried a couple different combo pedal boards, (Digitech 500, Boss ME-70), but quickly realized I wasn't getting my sound and the money was quickly drying up.  With not much left, I tried a Tuna Melt as an example of Danelectro.  Who would think?  This thing is stunning in its ability to manufacture vintage tremolo sounds, as are most of this line of pedals.  I now own about 12-14 of these of all types, and have never been dissapointed save it's very hard to chain them without a lot of noise.Then I got into guitar building, and they all got put away.  Lately, I have been trying to make time to improve my playing skills, and joy of joys! I am rediscovering all these pedals and I absolutely love them.Forget the FAB series, they are not so hot.  Buy the old style as the Tuna Melt, or the big metal ones like the Dan Echo.  You will NOT be sorry!",positive
"Hello Musicfriends - This is built cheap but sounds great. Good controls too. For me in the studio/songwriting  its perfect but I would not exactly go on tour with it..... There is something about the knobs I still love, even if all my other digital units have a tremolo hidden in it... may be  the age thing...",positive
"it sounds great.  nice and warm and lush.  one of the better trems i've had the pleasure to use.  however, i hate the plastic housing, and how the input/output jacks are located.  I don't have heavy feet, so it will probably last a good long while on my board, but i really wouldn't want to put too much weight on it.",positive
"It is exactly what you need in a capo! You can cover all six strings, move one string over to get a drop d tuning or turn the capo upside down to get a partial capo (though a bit of adjusting may be needed to get the strings held down.).All in all, a great capo that is well made and will last forever.Kyser is an awesome small Christian company and I really like their products and supporting them with my purchases. :]",positive
Love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours.  Prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses.,positive
"The title says it all.  I got it for $16 (free shipping with Amazon Prime), which is cheaper than my local music store.  I keep it on the head of the guitar, and it is easy to add, move, remove.  With the trigger-type release, it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used.  It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  And best of all... it works!",positive
"I like it, it works well with my takamine acoustic jasmine s35 guitar. And it looks good. Overall, I recommend.",positive
"Quick to clip on and off. Really... Is there anything else to say? What else do you want it to do?These suckers are wonderfully reliable.I've had one for about 10 years. The only thing that went wrong with it was the removable rubber on the ""bottom"" of the capo became damaged because of my own neglect. However, for a $1, keyser sent me a bag of a about 6 of them. Can you go wrong? NO!Great product!",positive
a couple of bucks more than dunlop...which i have not tried..i own a couple wish they were cheeper i would have one in each case..but it works fine..and is well made...arrived on time..enjoy,positive
"Like this camo capo's simplicity and its unique color.  My friend got a new one after seeing me using it, but his is a bit shorter than mine.  Mine works both uke & acoustic guitar, I have no problem to use it on single hand.  As the manufactor suggests for its duration, I don't clip it on the guitar when it's not in use. :)",positive
"This Capo looks great and does the job. It does take a bit of pressure to open the camp, but its better then the winding versions.",positive
"Purchased the 6-string Kyser capo when I meant to get the 12-string version (slightly longer, stronger spring?), but find that this 6-string Capo not only works great on my 2 6-string acoustics, but also works on my 12-string acoustic with a little adjusting.  Quality seems top notch, design is simple and effective.",positive
I've owned the same one for 10 years and it's still going strong after many gigs. The spring tension is just right.,positive
"high quality hassle free design.  Very quick and easy to install and remove in a hurry and dosn't mar the finish or use excessive force,  but strong enough to move the capo all the way close to the next fret closer to the headstock to allow maximum room for my fingers without any buzzing.  Very happy with this purchase.",positive
"I have had one for two years and no complaints, needed another for my travel guitar.  The lever arm is coated with a soft plastic sleeve which protects the neck, the spring is firm and in 2 years has not given up any tension. Finally on the string compression side the material is firm yet supple.  I take particular caution to make sure that I don't leave it on anything that would indent that material permanently...",positive
I've seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but I've never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this Kyser one.  It is by far the best I've ever seen and I've been using it for years now and it still works fine.  It makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn't corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years.Very highly recommended!,positive
"It is very well made, is easy to use, and holds down the strings just fine.  It is well protected as to not scratch or nick your guitar.",positive
"Durable, affordable, easy to grasp and use.",positive
This capo is as good as I've ever used and its in pink which perfectly matchs my shell pink strat. Great deal.,positive
"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across, doesn't require tension adjustment, and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second, it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard, it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets, causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby.",positive
Easy to useGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand. Thank you very much,positive
"Got what I needed - a basic capo for a good price.  The tension is a little tighter than I'd like, but works for me.  Covers all strings, and depresses them fully.  I don't use it often, so I can't speak to its longevity, but good for me!",positive
"I've played guitar for 5 years. Seen many different capos, but none that quite satisfies me as the Kyser.You really can't go wrong with this capo. It is very mobile, easily adjustable, sturdy, and durable.What's good about this capo is that you can use it as a regular 6 String capo and still turn it around to use it asa Cut capo. The transparent rubber piece does the same job.It comes in different colors also.I own the black, silver, gold, and camo Kyser capos.I also own the Cut Capo for other styles.I recommend it!All the capos I've had from Kyser are still in great conditions.Use them all the time at church and at home",positive
I started using Kyser capos a couple of years ago and have never looked back since. I now own several of them and have not had any problems with any of them. They work great on acoustic and electric guitars and they have survived the many children I teach lessons to even though they get treated rather rough at times. Great capos. You won't be disappointed.,positive
What's to say?  It's not a high end capo and for the price I can lose it ( like most of the other capos I have owned).  It's not a high quality capo and it does take a few adjustments to get it seated properly.,positive
"I originally bought this for my guitar and it worked very well for that, so I tried it out on my 4 string uke and it works just as great. It's so much better than the elastic capos. So, it's doing double duty and going strong.",positive
"This style of capo CAN throw your guitar out of tune if you don't put it on right. When used correctly though, it does it's job just fine.",positive
"I can only repeat what everyone else has already said: this Kyser capo is designed and built very well. It's easy to put on and adjust, and just as easy to take off. There are probably a few capos out there that are a bit flashier, but this is still pretty stylish. And the price makes it a real bargain.",positive
"I don't believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo, but this one is quite good.  For those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use.  It does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built.  It is as with all capos,  important to take it off when not in use so the ""rubber"" does not get grooved.  This is just good common sense.  If this lasts a couple of years I will definitely purchase another.",positive
I bought a 12 string one in blk.  Love it for simplicity and needed it so I didn't have to keep searching for the other.  Got gold to remind me it is for six strings.,positive
"I have used a few different capo's this is far and away my favorite. Very easy to take it off, holds the strings tight. What more can you ask for? Does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive.",positive
It does what it says. It a Kyser Quick Change capo. This capo is great for changing keys in the middle of a song or anytime you are in a hurry. Highly recommended.,positive
"It's a capo... nice fit... yet, sometimes I wonder if it fits too tightly, as when I use it, and of course the strings are tighter, sometimes I feel that playing with this particular capo makes my strings too tight...yet, it is a capo, structured very well.",positive
I am very pleased with this purchase. The strings play very clearly with zero buzzing on any position between frets. I can dramatically hear and feel the difference than when I used a cheap $5 capo before. This is well worth your pay :),positive
My husband usese this capo almost everytine he plays his guitar. His old one lasted about 10 years. Worth the cost.,positive
"Long time Shubb user, but decided to try something different.I think I've found how lazy I am. I ended up using the Kyser more often than the Shubb because of the fact that you can put the Kyser on the peghead.Reaching my hand to an always available position on guitars (i.e. the peghead) for the Kyser turns out to be much more convenient than reaching to something that is not on the guitar and that could change according to situations, e.g. maybe just by my side on the sofa in my living room, maybe a table or the floor in some other places, for the Shubb.",positive
These Capos are wonderful. Perfect all the way around! long lasting and backed up by the company. I have three!,positive
Good strong spring and good strong materials.  The only improvement I would make is the clear protector that holds behind the neck.  The protector needs to be longer.  As the protector ages it slips off the end.  If it had more surface extended from end to the base where it pivots it would help.,positive
"I bought this Capo for myWashburn D10. It works on my Orlando classical guitar as well. I wanted a capo that was simple to operate and wasn't too expensive - and the Kyser Quick Change Guitar Capo fits the bill nicely:[Update 7/25/10: My Orlando guitar was stolen. Boo Hoo!!!]- Easy On, Easy OffThe spring mechanism makes it easy to put the capo on or take it off.- Rubberized ClampsRubberized clamps helps prevent the Kyser from scratching or marring the neck and the frets.- ErgonomicThe arched arm with the weird-looking loopy looking thingy and the other straight arm help you to firmly grab on to them without slipping so you can easily and quickly remove or reposition the Kyser Capo.- DurableThe Kyser is made from durable aluminum.[Update 7/25/10] I've had this capo for almost 3 years and it's still working like a champ! (According to Amazon's Instant Order Update for moi, I got this capo on  November 22, 2007.)- The Same Capo Colbie Caillat Used in BubblyCheck out the music video! It's the same capo Colbie Caillat used inBubbly!---The Kyser Quick Change Guitar Capo is excellent! I don't think you can go wrong with this one!",positive
"I have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently. The price is right for these, and they work just fine. My only real issue is that sometimes, they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret you're going to bar, thus producing a sound you weren't looking for. Some of the higher end capo's counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring. However, like i say, these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard, and are from what i can tell, the most popular model on the market.",positive
"Easy to use capo. Good strength - holds the strings down well.. Not sure that it's as good as the G7th capo, which I still find is the best for holding the strings down evenly so that they stay in tune, but the Kyser is much cheaper and does a good job.",positive
"Probably the best kapo out on the market. Very high quality and a sleek look. Easy to use, what more could you want?",positive
"I use the capo for my guitar and it sounds awesome. I like to put the capo on the first fret and when I play a song I made, it sounds really really good. The capo is very easy to use as well.",positive
"I really like my capo, the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic, and it works as it should. However, I feel like it deserves 4 stars simply because it could be a much more robust product. For example, I think the bottom part of the clamp should be a little longer, and rounded (the back side of a guitar neck is rounded, after all). The spring could definitely be tighter...I do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough. Also, the design is fairly nice, but it's mostly aesthetic...it's not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily.Don't get me wrong, this is a rather good product, and it's priced about right. It just isn't a high end product/5-star perfect.",positive
The package arrived on time. This is the best capo around and works great. Does what it is supposed to do.,positive
"works great. Just clip it on and jam out.forget the screw on type, and spend the few extra bux for this one.  you'll be happier, trust me.",positive
I chose the patriotic design for obvious reasons.  It is lovely.  Clear shard silk screening.  The capo itself is really good.  It is very snug on the strings.,positive
"i got pink cause nobody would steal it, and we all know how often capos get stolen from people pink is great",positive
"This capo is awesome, it looks and feels very nice and premium, it works on all of my guitars not much more you can ask for.",positive
These Martin strings (M170) aren't bad. They just are not the sound I was looking for. I ended up like the Ernie Ball Earthwood extra light instead. The Martin's are little shallow on the low end unlike the Ernie Ball. Other people will love them though. They are easy to play.,positive
"These are good for the average guitar player who doesn't want to much strain or pain on there fingers. Not the fullest tone, but you wouldn't expect that with extra light strings.",positive
"I have an electro acoustic Martin (second hand but without a scratch). I got it with .13 strings and well, is simply too much. Is good to play rithyms but can't do pretty much nothing else.I have installed a set (I got 8) and it sounds really good. Not as solid as the .13 but now i have more range to do solos and go up and down much easier.Recomended",positive
"Martin makes great sounding strings.  I decided to use Light Martin strings (.12) because they sounded louder and better, and I could play them just as easy as the lighter strings.",positive
Strings are not just strings. Guitar strings are another very important part of playing GREAT Guitar. And all Martin products are second to none.,positive
"I replaced a set of strings that were very used with these Martins.  They are, as named, very light.  They are easy on my fingers and give great tone.  Quality company, great strings, great price!",positive
"I ordered a couple sets of this strings so I would have some extras for myself and my 6 year old son who is just starting out on guitar. this strings have good sound and hold a tune well. the best thing is the price is great. Like I said I am usinging these on mine and my sons guitar and my son was breaking string from playing to hard, but with these string it does not break the bank to replace them as needed.",positive
"The name Martin says it all & has for many,many years.Grab some extras because you will want more, Great price,great strings.",positive
"I love these strings, and use them for all of my acoustic playing. Best of all, I can find them here for $3.49 per set, so I'm not dumping a bunch of money on strings all the time. Easy to play, and they sound great.long lasting if you take care of them by wiping them down every time.",positive
these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven I use them all the time,positive
Good strings with good sound.The Extra Light is easier on the fingers - but they sound thinner too.Go for the Light gauges for more solid sound if you can handle the pressure.,positive
"This is my third pack; the 1st pack has been using for two months, the sounds are rich and full, and the feels are still good.  I broke the high E on the 1st attempt of restringing, and luckily I had bought 2 packs at the same time.  So, I want to keep a completed pack for back up.  I have been fingerpacking for quite long time recently, sometime, i will practice for 4-5 hours+ until i'm tired for the session.  I have used light steel strings on my acoustic, but these ones are easier for fingers even just tiny lighter.",positive
These are okay strings for the Folk Guitar.............nothing special but the price isn't out of the world either. Good buy for the money. Tried them on a Gibson J50 and they seem to do good.,positive
"I am yet another one of those ""Forever Beginners"" when it comes to playing the guitar. Never mind that...these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better! After putting in new pegs and re-stringing with these strings...it sounds so much nicer! More richer! Now I see I need to replace the saddle and bridge on it as the pegs keep coming loose. I think that once I do this and then re-string these same strings on it...I will be set to go!I like that these strings are light as due to not having had much practice for a number of years...let's face it...my fingers get sore when playing! I also have small fingers and hands.I intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use.I recommend!",positive
"I restrung my Martin 0-16NY with these strings and found them to be excellent.  As a new guitarist,the light strings were very easy on my sensitive finger tips and have a very warm and rich sound.",positive
"Even though these are folk strings, I put them on my 35 year old dread and they sound really good.I hope they last longer than some of the reviews indicate.I also wipe them down after playing to minimize tarnishing.So far so good",positive
"Great,great sound. The sound of these strings is different than any other strings you could get. They also teach a guitar player to use a lighter touch while playing to produce beautiful sounds. Well worth it.",positive
the string work well but did not give the mellow sound on my guitar that I was looking for. The shipping was quick and the strings were recieved in good order.,positive
"I love these strings.  I bought a set awhile back for my Ovation, but never used them.  Then I came into possession of an old Yamaha acoustic guitar which was pretty beat up and needed new strings.  I put these suckers on there and wow was I impressed.  Even that old beater guitar sounded great and played easily with these strings.  So... I bought another set for the Ovation this time!",positive
I bought this pick holder because I hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you can't play with a pick in your strings. I originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock. Boy was I wrong. The picture is misleading.  This thing is tiny and barely goes across three string. It wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks (maybe more if they are thin) into the wedges on top. Stays in place well and is very convenient.Only negative is I don't know how long it will hold up. I think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better. I can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks.,positive
I really like these things.  I don't stick tape and stuff to guitar body which if they do make a double sided tape similar to post it notes might be a good idea.  Bought a few while back and just bought a few more.  If you drop a pick there is another right there.  Have fun.,positive
I love the idea that you don't need a pocket in your strap or elsewhere to store your pick. Further it will not add something else to find/loose in my pants pocket.,positive
it's good but think its a bit expensive for just one they should give you two for that price or lower the price,positive
"Doe's not stay on to well, moves to much even if you go for the pick lightly could be redeisigned.",positive
Excellent simple product. Fits all of my guitars and stays out the way while playing. Easily holds 2 picks at at time on each end. Has grooves on ends and one can slide it down so that at least 2 strings fit into the grooves.,positive
Since I bought these little gadgets everybody playing guitar around want them.I use to misplace my picks all the time when playing and now I do not have to look around for them any longer as I know where to find them.  I like to use different gage picks therefore.  I have ordered more for Christmas stocking stuffers whicdh will be enjoyed by my friends.,positive
"It's a lot smaller than the picture makes it look, but that's a good thing. It serves it purpose and fits snugly between the strings on the headstock.",positive
"I'm using this right now on my acoustic and it does its job in respect to holding your picks. It was smaller then I would have pictured, but it still is a good product. It can hold light to heavy picks and its super easy to put it and take it off. Only problem I had was that it moves a lot when putting my pick back in. Besides that, its highly recommendable to anyone. I will definitely pick up more for my other axes.",positive
"Not too much to say, it's made out of foam, made to slip between the strings, made to hold two picks.  I have several of these, for acoustics and for electrics.  My son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it won't be dislodged, still, it does stay on majority of the time.  I do recommend this.  My son's guitar teacher calls this a ""fancy little pick holder"" and I've had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time.  One must also be careful, my son lost one of these so I know it is a possibility of it falling off.  He lost it after performing in a play on stage.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.",positive
"I have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar, as I often find myself playing with fingers, then suddenly a ""pick song"" starts and... where's a pick? I usually have to offset it, and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick, but I still find them indispensable. And no tape or other sticky stuff!There is also a model made specially for bass. [Updated] I now have the bass model on all of my basses. It is definitely better for thicker strings.The guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer. I do love it, but the ""spreading strings"" on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. So, still highly recommended if your headstock has a ""straight through"" design, not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock. (They should make a Metal Edition for that. :) )",positive
"I was thinking it may affect the ability to tune properly, but it seems to have no affect at all. Super audiophile tone hounds might say it affects the resonance and sustain, but just take it off when recording. Very handy to have two picks with you at all times. It's great not to have to make a trip back to the mike stand to get a pick or having to attach something with sticky tape to the guitar's finish. Me likey!! Price can't be beat either!",positive
"I bought one of these to try on my Asher Junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick. Worked, but it was difficult getting all three picks in one Wedgie so I ordered a second one. Between the two of them, between the 2nd/3rd and 4th/5th strings up next to the nut, works pretty good holding these types of picks (which admittedly, the Wedgie was not actually designed for). Liked it so much I ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass (the bass version). Only down side I see is -- they DO seem loose like they could fall out AND I doubt the picks will stay in place when I case my guitar (haven't tried it yet). But otherwise, worth the price and a good doo-dad to have around. Especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself (real help to me staying organized!).",positive
"I've played string instruments for the better part of 55 years... Starting with a cheap Tijuana Wood box as a 5 year old, progressing to Martin 6 and 12 string Acoustic guitars, and a few electric Fender and Gibson units.... All good in their own respect.I decided to treat myself to a Les Paul for my 58th birthday but, not having the financial resources to buy a $3,000.00 git, I shopped and shopped... Finally settling on this Cherry Burst LP-100.It arrived in perfect condition, the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding. It was even ""sorta"" in tune... but a quick dial-in with the electronic tuner brought that right.Simply put, Nice guitar. After allowing the strings and neck to settle in together, I spent a few hours a week later adjusting string height, intonation, and pick-up distances, and now this LP *ROCKS* !!!If you're going to spend mid-range $$$ on a fine practice / performance guitar, you can't go wrong with this one, kids - Two Thumbs Up ![Suggestion: A Fender Mustang 1 or 2 amp makes this guitar sound even better...]",positive
"exactly the same as describe here, love the sound and easy to play. great price for excellent sound, highly recommend to everyone.",positive
"This is a fine guitar, but it isn't amazing.  My particular instrument has some issues with the finish in a couple of places around the perimeter of the guitar - they look like black splotches underneath the sunburst paint and clear-coat.  There's one near the top strap post and another near the place where the pick-guard mounts to the underside of the body.  Neither would be apparent to someone who wasn't appraising the guitar, but they are there and don't look normal to me.  Maybe I got the first one off the line after they switched from black-painted models?  My guitar also has a weird V shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesn't match at all - I'm guessing that it's a joint that has been glued together.  I know that the better Les Paul guitars have a one-piece neck, and since I didn't read about this one having something different, I assumed it would be the same.  Glue is stronger than wood and Les Paul guitars have a tendency to break in that area, so I guess my guitar should be more durable than some. Still, it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery.  I'm not sure that seeing these finish issues before-hand would've dissuaded me from buying the same guitar, but upon reflection it would've been much smarter to visit a music store and examine the guitar before buying.My remaining issues with the instrument have more to do with the general design of all Les Paul guitars versus my particular instrument.  The guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap, even while sitting.  The top strap peg is angled up slightly, where guitars with horns have them angled down, which means that investing in the install of a straplock system of some kind is a good idea with a Les Paul - the pegs just don't stay in the strap holes as well as on some other guitars.  It's great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that &#34;real&#34; Les Paul guitars do, but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup.  The range of adjustment on the saddles is pretty small, and I found it impossible to setup the guitar for coated .09 strings without additional hardware.The guitar sounds decent, it looks pretty great (although not quite as pretty as the pictured one), and due to its shorter scale length it is a tad easier to play than some other guitars.  Note: the shorter scale length is characteristic of Les Paul guitars, it doesn't indicate that this is less than a &#34;full-sized&#34; guitar.  Though this is a fine guitar for the price, I'm not sure that I would make the same choice if I were in the same position again.",positive
"I have been playing guitar for over 30 years. I've owned and played a variety of guitars in my lifetime. My wife bought this guitar for me as a gift. I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this guitar. It is a solid, well built guitar. The finish is beautiful. The pictures do it no justice. It sounds incredible. It has great tone and sustain, wonderful harmonics. The clean tones are nice and warm. The neck is fast. No fret noise or hums. The pickups are really nice. Its very versatile and you can play just about anything with it. From blues to hard rock & metal. I would perform live with this guitar in a heartbeat. You cannot find a better guitar for this price. I would have expected it to cost much more. I am extremely impressed with this great guitar. You can bet, when I add the next guitar to my collection, it will be another epiphone. Well done Epiphone!!",positive
"I had been learning on a Squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar. After doing research, reading reviews, and checking it out in a guitar store, I chose this one.It's much easier to play than the Squier, and it has a better sound. Like the Squier (but not as bad), it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. I suspect it might need to be adjusted, but I don't have a clue as to how to go about it.It's also a good choice for women. I'm a small woman, and I really like that the neck is smaller. It's also fairly lightweight.Overall, I'm happy with my choice. A guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500. Maybe. I expect to be happy with it for a few years before I upgrade again.",positive
"I bought it 3 years ago here at amazon and I couldn't be happier.  This was my first electric and after over a year of owning it, I got a way more expensive Fender Strat and I still prefer how this Epiphone feels; it is really lightweight, a lot more that even other Les Pauls and the distance between frets is smaller than the one in other guitars I have tried, this makes it VERY easy to play, it stays in tune and it looks really REALLY lovely.I like it so much, that I decided to add a pair of Slash's Alnico IIs on it, that cost more than the guitar itself, this only made it sound incredibly awesome and improve the sustain, good ol' crunchy-bluessy rock.Call me cheap if you want and I wouldn't care, this is one of those items that makes you wonder, how come there's others way more overpriced and just don't find a way to justify that a ""real"" Gibson Les Paul will sound $800 - $1000 better.It wasn't until recently (after 3 years - I estimate somewhere around 1000 hours of heavy use) that it started fretting and that's why I gave it only 4 stars; but what would you expect from a $200 guitar...?  I'm sure this can be easily fixed by any guitar tech and it will continue been the sweet-tone machine it has always been.  If you're learning, looking for a first electric or just want a ""practice"" axe that will not dissapoint you, just go ahead and buy it, don't give it a 2nd thought and do it.",positive
"I have been playing guitar since I was 6 years old (over 3 decades) and I must say this was a very pleasant surprise.  I haven't had an electric in years, and didn't have the budget to get a Gibson, so picked up this Epi Les Paul 100 instead, along with a Fender Mustang I Amp.  Great combination.  This guitar has a very sloid feel, and came set-up perfectly right out of the box.  All it needed was tuning.  Unlike others, I didn't feel that the strings I got needed to be changed right away, but probably within the first two weeks you will want to change them.  Replaced mine with Ernie Ball ""Not Even Slinky's"" and couldn't be happier with the way this thing plays and sounds.  Great sustain, beautiful harmonics, the clean tones are warm, can get nice blues tones out of it, and superb thrash metal too.  Very versatile.  It does not quiet do country or jazz, but it wasn't really meant to.The action is extremely easy, fret board has a great feel to it, good width on the neck, not too slinder but not too thick.  It just feels good in your hands.The finish on this product is very nice.  One thing though, the pick guard is kind of a tan / cream off white color, not bright white as pictured, but it still looks great.Also, not mentioned in the description, but this does come with a 12 foot cord, but it's not the best quality.  Would recommend picking up a new one when you order.Overall, this is well worth the $500 that they list as the MSRP.  At less than half that its a steal.If you are considering this instrument, don't hesitate.",positive
"Well, the Epiphone Les Paul came in earlier this morning!Am I impressed? U bet cha!This thing is simply beautiful! It arrived well padded in a double box. Initially, I spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if I could spot any flaws. NONE! Not a finger print on it anywhere! This guitar is extremely well made and put together right. It was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter. The neck is slim (which is good for my thick hands) and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities. I put a quarter under the 10th. fret and it's right on the &#34;money&#34;!It's considerably heaver than than I thought.  I would imagine it weighs about 10-14lbs. I have a strap ordered and on the way.The maple top is a work of art with a superior finish. All the metal hardware appears top quality as are the Duncan pickups. This Epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing I ever had.  Your hand floats over the frets!I don't think you could get a better piece for the price point.",positive
"This is one awesome guitar!  I also purchased the Fender Mustang I Amp, Epiphone custom case (fits like a glove) and Planet Waves Planet Lock Leather Guitar Strap (comfortable and very secure) which made for an UNBELIEVEABLE combination along with Rocksmith 2014.  I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination.  The only problem in my household is....who gets to play next.",positive
"Waited two months before reviewing my les paul 100 to make sure there were no issues.  I am very happy with the guitar.  It came well padded and was in excellent shape.  It was set up well and has played well out of the box.  Just did my first string change making sure I used the same gauge of string and didn't have to make any adjustments to the guitar.  Played as well after the change as it did before.  Was a little nervous about an online purchase and not being able to play the guitar before buying but when you live out in the sticks and it's a major trip to get to a real guitar store you sometimes take your chances.  Anyway it all worked out as the guitar is very easy to play, free prime two day shipping, no sales tax, and saved about $80 in gas it would have taken to make a trip to buy one in a store.  The savings in gas and tax paid for about half of my new Mustang 2 v2 amplifier.The only thing is on the epiphone site it states all their electric guitars include a cable in the box.  This one did not and from reading their forum it seems it is almost a normal thing for cords to somehow disappear before reaching the customer.  It is not a big deal to me but I thought I'd mention it for those thinking of buying a epiphone.  When I ordered this one I wasn't really sure if a cable would be included or not so I ordered one at the same time, I'm glad I did.",positive
"First off, the shipping was fantastic. It shipped the very next day and came VERY well protected in perfect condition. It is an extremely well made and solid product. I think a few people have given this Les Paul a rep of just being a ""Starter Guitar"". Trust me when I say, I have no problem leaving my Les Paul Standard at home and taking this one to a gig. It plays well and the sound?? INCREDIBLE. It even has a great acoustic sound to it when not plugged into an amp. I can't say enough good things about this guitar it's that good. If you're thinking aout buying this guitar, don't. Just buy it!! BUY IT!!",positive
"It'd been about 6 years since I've had an electric guitar. I traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned. I decided recently after moving back to my home town that I was going to get back into playing electric guitar, only this time I wanted it to be more than a &#34;hobby&#34;. I fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will EASILY deliver.It came in perfect condition. The action is set perfectly and I don't have any issues with buzzing strings. It comes with clear (black) control knobs, which I'll likely replace with something a bit prettier. But overall this is a great guitar. It even sounds amazing, it really does have that ballsy sound of a LP..... because well 0_o it IS a LP. Its no Gibson, but it IS a LP!Very happy with this purchase!!!!",positive
"Purchased primarily for Rocksmith and it works very well for that.  Still learning how to play, but like the feel of this guitar.  Looks great and plays great.  Was packaged very well.  Only needed minor setup adjustments. I would recommend getting strap locks.",positive
"I am editing my previous review on this little guitar after taking the time to properly set it up, dial it in and play it for a while.  I edited yet again as someone didn't appreciate my ""gloating"" over other guitars I own.  Sorry to offend YOU.I made a knee jerk review (again) right after I got this.  But in all fairness I received my Gibson Les Paul on the same day, buying IT from my local music store and professionally set up, ready to go.  I was comparing apples and oranges, so to speak.  But now, even after comparing them to each other, they really aren't that far apart.The Gibson is the best guitar I've ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it.  But this little baby is now my second favorite.My other review was NOT FAIR!!!!!!  I paid a lot more for the Gibson and 149 bucks for this Epiphone.  Dollar for dollar this little Ephiphone is a steal!!!!  WOW!!!I must honestly admit, the edge goes to my Gibson, but not by as much as you'd think.  This little Epiphone is an outstanding guitar, regardless of price.  If I were to play them each blindfolded I would never guess one was $149 guitar, ever!  The tone of the Epiphone is much like the Gibson Les Paul.  It's easy to play, comfortable and has a sweet sound.  I can either rock out with it or mellow out and play the blues or classic rock.To be honest, I will probably play this Epiphone a LOT more than the Gibson.  After all, if I ding this one up I haven't broke the bank.  I think I'll tend to use this one a lot more than the other.I am very happy with this Epiphone Les Paul and will proudly play and OWN it.  I am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge.  I may purchase another one and put it away as I'm sure the price won't stay this low.  PLUS, I'll get another one in a different color!!  You can never have too many guitars..  I am going to an a pickguard to this one.  The finish on it is outstanding and I'd like to keep it that way.If I were thinking of learning to play the guitar, this one is a no-brainer....BUY IT!!!If you're an established player looking for a really nice practice guitar, I'd buy this one is a heartbeat.  I was shocked at how sweet it sounds, how good it looks, how comfortable and light it is and how well it plays.  Sure it was way out of tune and required a few height adjustments but now it is FANTASTIC.New rule for me, no writing reviews until I own the product for at least one week!!!!!",positive
"this is a beautiful guitar...the finish is amazing...and the tone is very clear...if you can't afford several hundreds or thousand for a les paul...this is a fun and very good guitar for the money...has 6 strings,,,from e to e...and if you know the g chord you will have lot's of fun...the volume control goes to 11 ,if you want to kick it up a notch...(only kidding)",positive
"Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar, EbonyHello again. I have written a review on this guitar just after I purchased it and now it's been over a year and I still stand by my positive review. I own about 8 guitars now and this guitar is one of two of my favorites. My other favorite is a Dean electric 12 string.  When I hold and play this Epiphone Les Paul special 2 guitar it feels and sounds like something I could take on stage but it doesn't have the cost associated with a Gibson. What's also amazing is that it's still around a $150. It's well worth the noney. It stays in tune and it high quality. Well worth the money. I just purchased an electric/acoustic Epiphone ukelele today for my Chiropractor. I will review that later. If you are looking for a Les Paul guitar this is not one. Not his typical style although Amazon does sell one for about $250 so don't let the name fool you. It's still a very nice guitar though. Very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners. I highly recommend this guitar. Buy it!  Thank you.",positive
"I've been playing for over 40 years. I currently own 60 or so guitars. My problem with LP's is they feel like a boat anchor around your neck, I've bought and sold quite a few. Another problem with real LP's, you only get one chance to drop one, just see how many used ones have head-stock repairs. They ARE beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play. I deal in used guitars, picked up an Epi Special ll along with several other guitars at a resale shop for very cheap. I didn't mess with it until I was ready to set it up for resale. I fully expect to do a fret level on most guitars, even a lot of higher end guitars need it. I found on the Special ll the frets were actually very well done (Chinese version from 2011) and only needed a slight leveling (would have played fine without it but I am very picky). It didn't take much to get it set up, small truss rod adjustment, new set of 10's for strings. little bit of adjustment to the bridge, cut the nut a bit....note it played well the way I got it, just like my stuff perfect. Got it set-up and plugged it in to check the electronics and that's when I started to really become impressed with this guitar. Cheap pickups are supposed to sound muddy with no character, these sounded pretty good, actually very good, nice and bright with a nice tight bottom end. I check sound also by cranking up a backing track to stage level and playing a few tracks. It cut through really well. I noticed while doing this test that the volume had a very nice sweep to it and didn't lose any highs when turned down. The tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep, very nice. I popped off the back cover to check what was in there, full sized pots, maybe not the best quality but much better than expected. I normally upgrade electronics on my personal guitars to get the controls to operate the way I like but no need to fix what's not broken. Yup, I said ""on my personal guitars"" because I am keeping this one for myself. The neck is very fast and comfy, it's NOT a boat anchor so my shoulder will thank me. The tuners are the lower end trapezoid type but turn smoothly with no backlash and keep the guitar in tune fine, once again if it ain't broke don't fix it. Please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut. I've set-up hundreds of guitars and almost all of them need nut work, doesn't matter what price point you are at. This also has a bolt on neck. A lot of players say you have to have a set (glued) neck. I feel glue actually deadens the sound a bit, I prefer a good solid bolt on to transfer sound, IMO. I have found that the quality level of the low end foreign guitars has become very good. I know that corners have to be cut to get to the price point of these budget guitars but all in all the Special ll is good to go right out of the box with just a little tweaking. My advice is to go try one, my taste may not be the same as yours. There are a lot of good value well made guitars now-a-days, I just found at this price vs quality ratio the Epiphone Special ll really is special. Get one, get it set up for a few bucks if you can't do it yourself, and you will have a good instrument. Oh did I mention this is a very good looking guitar?",positive
Good overall but pick ups are terrible - Might be better replacing the pickups but I wasn't willing to spend the extra money,positive
"I got this pretty fast. I took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it 5 stars just for value alone. I'm still shaking my head in disbelief that I got this guitar for the price. First, the 'tuner' issues that I've been reading about. Replace the strings! I stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune. A set of D'Addario 10's cured that straight away (or whatever you prefer just change them). The tuners aren't the best but they are not to blame, it's the cheap strings. Now, technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box. The neck angle was so off the A string rattled no matter how high I set the bridge. The guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle. Yes I could have sent it back but I suspect I would have gotten another just like it. I had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck AND the nut (Never had to do this to the nut on an electric, not even on a used guitar. The nut slot was cut too deep), as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable. It required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most I've ever had to use. After I got that straight I removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws. In my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter.If I bought this used none of this would have been a big deal. But as I'm looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work I'm steadily staring at the 'QC passed' sticker. Must have been built on a Friday afternoon or something.--- NOW--after I did this it is sweet!!. I play through a Peavey Valveking 100 and it rocks as good as my Strat w/  Duncans and Dimarzios. The quality of the electronics is not sub par at all. After adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them,  I'd argue that this is as good as any Epi I've ever played as far as pups and all, so don't hesitate there because I don't really care for Epis and I'm in love with it. (I bought this to sell mainly, but now????)  The build quality; hmm, if you can do guitar work go for it. Otherwise I'd highly recommend a more expensive model. The $299 models are great right out of the box usually.",positive
"If you are considering this guitar, I have to assume you're shopping for an electric guitar at the lower end, not trying to decide between this and a Gibson Les Paul Custom.  It is in the category of beginner/intermediate guitars that I rate this a 5 star instrument.I really couldn't find anything ""wrong""  with it.  Yes, it has shortcomings as compared to the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls, such as having only two controls for volume and tone, rather than four, which also means it has a slightly different look that the famous Gibson.  But you weren't planning to try to fool anyone, were you?  Beginning players would be well advised to focus on developing their skills and honing technique, rather than fussing around with tone controls anyway.The sound is good, and I found the appearance and finish of mine to be just fine.  The pickups are surprisingly good.  The same electronics are found on some of the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls.  It was no great surprise to find that the strings are no good, although it would sure be nice if they didn't cut corners on such an inexpensive component that is also integral to sound quality.As for fit and finish, reading the reviews has convinced me that there is a lot of variation in both, and it is luck of the draw whether you get one that was made on a Monday after a long weekend of partying.  For several reasons, if I had this to do over, I would not buy it online (nor would I buy it from GC).  Better to inspect the actual guitar you'll be buying, and don't be shy about asking them bring out another one if you don't like the first one you see.I discovered too late that my local music shop would have sold me this guitar for about the same price, but they would have included a full professional setup, including string change.  You are likely to find a similar deal where you live, because the smaller shops are having to do more and more to compete with the Internet and GC.As it is, I took my guitar to the local shop and paid for a setup.  It had some intonation problem, the action was too high, and as others have commented, the strings on this guitar need to be changed immediately.  I asked the luthier his opinion of the tuners, as I'd read a lot of people trashing the tuners.  Bearing in mind that he had a financial incentive to steer me toward replacing them, he instead assured me that they were fairly decent, and advised against changing them unless a problem develops.Out of the box, I was a little unsure of my purchase.  However, now that it's been fully set up  and new strings installed, I am quite pleased with this guitar.  I don't believe you will find a better guitar, or even close, at this price level.I did a lot of shopping, and considered guitars up to $500 for my first foray into electric.  I was tempted to go with something more expensive, on the theory that in a couple years, I'll want to upgrade anyway.  Now I'm glad I chose this one.  For one thing, this is a guitar I'll always enjoy having around.  There is nothing cheap or toy-like about it.  In 2-3 years, my tastes may change.  I may want something completely different down the road, and now I still have that option.  Had I gone with a more expensive model, I'd feel locked in.  No good!BOTTOM LINE:  If you're shopping for a guitar in this price range, I think you'll be pleased with this guitar.  Buy it locally so you can see the exact guitar you're buying, and negotiate to have a setup included, because it will almost certainly need one.  Have it set up right, install some quality strings, and you'll be very happy with the Epiphone LP Special II.",positive
"I got one of these a while back and being like I am with guitars took it apart to see just what it's made of.Mahogany ply maybe or capped with real, but it's plywood body inside.Kinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go there...Otherwise decent build, basic original lp design bolt on, surprisingly good electronics w/ full size pots and open back 3 way toggle, good neck but bad tuners.... Note: any 45% mount tuners, meaning mount hole at 8 and 4 o'clock position respectively... Will fit with the bottom hole of the 2 screw junk tuners mine had.  So add 10$ to get more than 30 minute in tune play here.And you can fill the other little holes with nail polish like it was made right to begin with.I like the style, and though there's plywood involved still good fit and finish, though many disagree it makes no real difference what electric guitar body woods are, only in looks.  Electric guitars don't resonate, that's why pickups are important.I don't like the idea of this as beginners choice for the simple fact of cheap tuning keys.You lose interest learning on something that can't hold good tuning.  So that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that.It's likely they'll keep this style but revise it some... to be hardwood body and real tuners as I  think the price point demands it.  Otherwise a decent piece good wiring, decent pickups... But...",positive
"Pretty sweet guitar for the price. Sounds like and plays like a Les Paul. I really like the vintage sunburst color (It's more orange than what the picture shows). The strings were setup on the nut close to the fret board the way I like it already when I got it. I just replaced the strings with heavier strings for personal preference. Overall, sounds and looks awesome! Would recommend it for anyone on a budget that wants the sound of a Les Paul.",positive
"My axesEpiphone LP Studio deluxe plustopFender MarauderTakamine G320Squier Standard StratSquier Standard PJ bassBeen playing 20 years.I had a Squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar I didn't care about that I could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with. But it got old and I wore the frets out so I needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith. I picked up the LP special 2 in black at Guitar Center for $130 and they kicked in free strings.Bought it for a game, but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good, played so well, and had a killer tone.My LP Studio had it's pickups replaced with the Zakk Wylde 81/85's which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have. Imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain, tone, and playability. Considering this thing is almost the same prices a Bullet Squier, it is easily twice the guitar for that price. You literally cannot find a better guitar for $150 than the Special 2.....Sound: 5/5Two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs, deep lows, and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound.The pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect.The pickups are high output and feel like AlNico more than Ceramic. Not sure which they have.So much sustain for a bolt on neck. I was shocked.Build Quality 4/5I did have 1 problem with the high E tuner. I didn't notice in the store but the string peg was 1/4"" up out of the headstock. When I discovered this I loosened the string, whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way.Intonation required no adjustment.Action was exactly the way I like itNeck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow.The finish was perfect. No nicks, blemishes, just oily black goodness.Neck was flush with no gaps or seams, and professionally shimmed. Damn good for a bolt on.Hardware is typical for the price but does the job, stays in tune very well.Back bending headstock and 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable.The bridge is similar to my LP Studio with the tunamatic setup. Individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts, IE can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings.Weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but I soon got used to it. No pickguard and it doesn't need one. Lots of relief between strings and body. You won't find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick. Makes it easy to clean too!Truss rod is behind a nice body color plate.Frets were smooth, rounded, and played nice. Could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough.Neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to. I would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top, soon got used to it and it wasn't an issue.500k pots and side body 1/4 TRplug keeps the cable out of the way.Overall 5/5Came with hex keys for setupCame with an awsome poster with all the Epiphone guitar modelsCame with a nice bumper stickerNo manualBody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks, about the same as any other $150 guitar.Summary: This guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument I own. It sounds good enough to gig with out of the box. IT's well built, plays well, and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music. The frets are medium jumbo's and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re-fretting than a typical Affinity or Bullet (2 squiers in this price range).I would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music. I did blues, metal, country, and pop. The pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a Fender, not as much of those nice Fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity.One thing I like about Epiphones and Gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge. This makes it VERY easy to palm mute and play with high gain. I lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my Strats the damn volume knob is in the way.As an experiment I took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if I could get a single coil sound out of it. What happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got EVERYWHERE. The tone was a little brighter and output a little lower, still no hum but you wouldn't fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil. I ended up putting the screws back in.I will likely put my LP Studio stock pickups back in (hell yeah coil tapping here I come!) and move my EMG 81/85's in this LP Special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitar.Do yourself a favor, buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar. It's cheap enough that you won't care if you bang it around a little, and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years.",positive
"This guitar is very attractive looking, and plays well right out of the box.  I am a beginner guitarist, so please take this review for what it's worth.  I am extremely pleased, and don't plan on ever upgrading.  This guitar is a darker cherry red wood color in the center than shown in the picture.  So expect it to be a different color than what you order.  See customer pics.It comes with strings installed and almost tuned.  The volume knob is well designed for smooth and convenient use.  The tremble and rhythm switch is far enough out of the way that you're not going to accidently hit it while strumming.  My only gripe is that the high E string gets caught on the top pickup when I'm playing hard, but maybe I'm just a novice.  I will say that it's very easy to play.Everything on it is very adjustable which I also like.  The only BUYER BEWARE statement I can think of is: you're going to be addicted to it!",positive
"I purchased this when it was on sale during the Christmas season - I figured that for the asking price at the time I could not go wrong.My expectations were frankly low. I had heard nothing but horrible things about Epiphones, with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune. Other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability. What I received was the polar opposite: I received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish, and one that stays in tune (amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when I unboxed it.)I am not wild about the strings that came stock, but I am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums. I guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads. In the near future I intend to restring the guitar withD'Addario ECG25 Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Light, 12-52, which, while thick, should make the instrument jazz-friendly. I realize that flatwound strings will require a new set-up and intonation, but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me, the new strings and work will be an investment.Out of the box, though, the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared [to my novice eyes and fingers] to be properly dressed. I have already invested in a good - but not great case:Guardian Hardshell Electric Guitar Caseto store the guitar (I also uploaded a customer-provided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fits.)For the record, I use the following amp, which I have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar:Kustom Defender 15 Watt Class A Guitar Headthat I run through aKustom  The Defender 1 x 12 Guitar Extension Cabinet for 5H Head.Bottom line: this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players. The price is right, and the quality clearly shows that off shore manufacturers have made significant improvements over the past year.",positive
"Listen,If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability, buy this one.  Period.I bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work, in case the guys called for a practice session, so I wouldn't have to go all the way home to pick up my gear.I have other, way more expensive guitars, like a Gibson ES-335, Dean 12 string, and a Fender Strat, but I gotta tell you, I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others!  No kidding.And if it gets banged up, so what???  It costs a buck thirty!  Buy another.  In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes, just for a cheap change up guitar.Dig it.",positive
"I'm updating a previous negative review. I had some issues with this guitar when it arrived. I couldn't get it setup, the action was very high and I couldn't set the intonation. Notes at the 12th fret were very sharp, and I couldn't lower them with saddle adjustments. I missed one vital checkpoint, the bridge needed to be lowered. Setup is finished, and I can now agree with most reviewers. For the price, this guitar is far better than any others in the price range. I know my grandson will enjoy it, at least for awhile. If it ends up as a dust collector, I'm not out much on the purchase price. I'll add it back to my own collection, and upgrade the electronics.",positive
"The Epiphone Les Paul guitars don't particularly sound that great, but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price. If your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar, but you're not completely sure if they will stick with it, if you can spend another $100 and get a used mexican made fender strat or tele. The reason for this is because for 1, if they decide it's not something they want to do anymore, you can resell it at the same price you bought it for (as long as it is still in decent condition) and little no money is lost. Second, if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a &#34;better&#34; or more high end guitar, Mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use. I have a couple different high end guitars and I will not get rid of my Mexy Strat because it sounds great still. I'll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this.",positive
"I purchased this guitar after much thoughtful consideration of other possibilities, but the nearly universal high marks for this particular make and model finally persuaded me to go with this one, and I do not regret that decision.First of all, it is a beauty. Initially, I was a little disappointed in that very little wood grain shows through the orangish finish. (My guitar was made in China, which may account for the darker hue.) I thought I had wanted a lighter color, but the more I look at it the happier I am with what I have. Second, this instrument is no light-weight, either in heft or playability. It is solidly constructed, very well put together, and plays like a dream. (I lowered the action until I encountered some fret buzz, then backed off the adjusting screws just a bit; that's basically the only adjustment I've made, or likely will make.)It's been barely a day since the guitar arrived and, as yet, I've only played it unplugged. I can't wait to hear how it sounds amped up.",positive
"I have been playing for about 7 years now and have a Tak Jasmine Acoustic and a Jay Turser Strat knockoff.  I really love the Les Paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the Les Paul price.  I've read just about everything I can on these Epi's and finally went to my local Music store to try one out.  My initial impression was somewhat mixed.  The sound was good but the action seemed ""off""  After playing a few scales and a couple easy chords I began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar.  Then I switched from the rear pickup to the front and BANG there was that sound I was looking for.  Classic Gibson Les Paul sound (in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat).  After playing around a bit more I asked to try one in the cherry finish.  They unboxed a new one for me and WOW this guitar looks AMAZING!  I sat down plugged it in and played a bit. Instantly I was in love.  The action was perfect (despite the some what heavier strings than what I'm used to).  The sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated.  Tuning is a breeze, and is held as well as any other guitar I own (I always retune before every session anyway).  Epiphone really did everything to capture that Les Paul sound in a economy guitar.  Yes I know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck, the cheaper humbuckers, the flat top construction, and the basswood body.  I point to the angled headstock, mahagony neck, rosewood fret board, and Gibson electronics.  I love the simple volume and tone controls (yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups) and the tun-o-matic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze (so much better than having the try to thread thru the body).  Even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing, oh and the sustain from it well lets just say I hit a low E last night before I went to bed, and I think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning (lol  If your looking for a Les Paul sound at a discount price- consider this your answer. Oh and my local shop was able to give me this guitar at $20 less than any place else, AND they will do a FREE setup for me after I've played it for a while (so far it's been perfect out of the box).",positive
"Wow, you would have thought this was the Holy Grail when it arrived at my house.  My son practically ran to the UPS man when the truck pulled up.  He is thrilled with this guitar.  Great purchase.",positive
"I got this guitar at Guitar Center, i was scared to get this guitar from amazon because of a review saying it looked like a toy, so i wanted to see it in person, i saw it, i tested it out at guitar center and it was amazing, its better than my other les paul special ii, this guitar plays great, its set up very nicely, the pickups are very nice, the electronics work perfectly, i have no problems with it, but the guitar is very beautiful, i would highly recommend getting it, i just dont know if anyone elses will be the same, not all guitars are made the same right?",positive
"A friend showed up at our monthly guitar club meeting with this and I loved having an on/off switch right at my fingertips. Genius!I bought 2 immediately. The shorter one goes from my guitar to the pedal board and the longer one from the pedal board to the amp. Works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears.Two issues to consider. The right angle plug was a mm or 2 short of being able to stick into my Tele and my Takamine. It would not seat properly and would slide out. I had to turn the cord around and use the right angle on the pedal board side, where it worked, but now the switch is &#34;down there&#34;. I don't think Planet Waves is the first connector that I had a problem with that so I dont blame them, but maybe stick with the straight jack if you are not sure. Second issue is simply that these little button-switches are fussy. You have to make sure you have it in the right position by looking at them - feel wont do. (If you see the white edge they are &#34;quiet&#34;)",positive
"This is my third circuit breaker cable. I play in church and no one wants to here the ""POP"" if I have to leave the sanctuary. Why three: 10foot, 15foot, and 20foot depending on the setup for the group - I hate cable jump rope. I really like the right angle connector makes it fit no matter what guitar stand I use.",positive
I love this cable. It is perfect for making guitar changes without noise. The cable itself does not seem quite as good quality as my other Planet Waves cables but it is still better than most others. The switch is easy to use.,positive
"So far I am a very satisfied customer with this cable.  For what is worth, while I have used these cables before, this is the first one I have ever owned, so I am no expert.",positive
"A nice concept that actually works, The cable is very nice, too with an adequate gauge. Try it out for yourself!",positive
"Update: The right angle switched end started developing crackling issues and is now intermittently cutting out. I've had it just over a month, so Amazon won't help me. Despite the lifetime warranty, Amazon has only offered to let me pay shipping and to give me a partial refund. Despite being an ""authorized retailer"" for Planet Waves, AMAZON DOES NOT OFFER EXCHANGE UNDER THE PLANET WAVES WARRANTY beyond the standard Amazon 30 day return policy. Amazon support referred me to the manufacturer. I've emailed Planet Waves, but the instructions for the warranty are to return it to a dealer for exchange. I don't have a dealer within 100 miles of my home, so unless the manufacturer comes through, this one is quickly becoming unusable and it looks like it might cost me to resolve it.I frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly. I've used cables with the G&H; quiet plug (which also works well), but the switched connector on this has an advantage over the G&H-; you can use it as a mute and tune with a head stock tuner without unplugging your instrument. The cable itself is a bit stiffer than I'm used to, which makes coiling for storage very easy, but it can quickly become a twisted mess on stage if you more length than you really need. The little elastic cord keeper strap works better than I could ever have imagined. I've never given the sound of a cable a thought, being a bass player who doesn't use much for effects and who plays mostly passive instruments. But using this with my Genz Benz Shuttlemax 9.2 and fEARful 15/6/1 cab, I really notice a pronounced difference in clarity and dynamics. The sound is much more alive with this over any of the other cables I have from a variety of manufacturers (Hosa, Proco, Whirlwind, etc). I've never had to warranty exchange a PW cable, but others tout the easy swap at any PW dealer as a great reason to buy them. I like knowing that. ** EDIT: AS STATED ABOVE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE IT THROUGH AMAZON BEYOND 30 DAYS **",positive
"Wow, these cables are made really sturdy. And the noiseless feature is priceless. Definitely a real good value for the money.",positive
30 feet of cable for what I paid for a 10 footer from my local guitar shop.I highly recommend!,positive
A long time Planet Waves user I trusted that the circuit breaker cable would be up to their usual high standards... IMHO it is not.The plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip. I like their old cables that had a long cable protector extending from the plug allowing the cable to flow gracefully from the guitar (and into the amp at the other end). The actual cable is horrible.... it is a hard plastic outer shell and does not lie or flex well like a good cable should (e.g. like my old Planet Waves cables do). They claim that the shielding is excellent but I find it to be mediocre. Very disappointing purchase.,positive
I'd chose this cable cause I own an older one with the angle plug and needed another longer cable with the straight end. I like the idea that you can cut the power  and remove the cable from the instrument with having  mute the amp or mixer. I recommend this product to anyone who likes the ability to disconnect without doing anything else.,positive
"I purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago, and have always loved it. I only use 3-4 pedals, and this is always one of them. It sounds great, is indestructable, and takes up almost no space. The controls are great, and you can get a large variety of sounds. I have played ""boutique"" chorus pedals, and the Boss is loads better in every way. You will not regret this purchase.Pros:-easy to use-no hum-small-sonds awesome-indestructabecons:-NONEIf you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever, will last forever, and sounds incredible, get this.",positive
"I bought this little pedal back in 1996, about a year after I got my first guitar.  I've tried other pedals, but ultimately, this one gives me the best sound.  It's very versatile and it's really easy to dial in just about any sound I want.  You might get a more dramatic effect from expensive rack units, but for cost and practicality, this pedal is your best bet!",positive
Very very good product! I have no complains about it.  Definitely a great buy and a Must have in your pedalboard.,positive
"First, let me start by saying this pedal has been part of my setup for nearly 7 years now and still looks/sounds as great as the day it came out of the box.Its a Boss product, which means you are going to pay for what you get.  You get the best bang for your buck with Boss products.  Solid, rugged construction that is built to last (no chance of breaking one of these things) and an outstanding analog stomp box with a genuine sound.  Good customer support as well and if you ever feel you need to sale your Boss pedal, resale prices are always good.While this pedal is capable of hundreds of tones and sounds (chorus is one of the most useful and versatile effects in my opinion)  Here are some of the best uses I have found.1. Tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect.  Perfect if you want to fatten up that really heavy chorus in a song and make it sound really full.2. Dime out the speed and depth for those crazy out of this world Korn type effects.  This is a really handy pedal for imitating tones of other bands because it can do so much.  There are a lot of bands tones I can come close to exactly matching, tones that took them 2 or 3 pedals to achieve.3.  Liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads.  This pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out.  If you play any kind of Christian music you will soon learn it doesn't matter what you do as long as you put chorus on it.  Walking in on Sunday morning and turn out some Slayer while using a chorus pedal and they will go nuts.  Chorus is just one of those effects no matter what type of music you are playing, you will always find a use for it, so there is no excuse for not adding this pedal to your rig.In addition you have some great features, easy access battery compartment, accepts a 9v power supply, works well with both guitar and bass, 2 out puts so you can run to 2 sources if desired, and all the controls you need to really be in complete control.  You HAVE to get this pedal!",positive
"Sweet chorus, I have the CE5, the CE20, a CE3 and this one. This chorus is my favorite, it sounds just right, the analog CE3 is awesome but too weak, Boss should include a level knob instead of a stereo control, anyway this one is a keeper!",positive
"OK... I am a pro musician & rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road. I was using an old Ibenez Chorus Pedal (one of the first to hit the market) of which I did not use much basically due to it's used for certain songs. I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the Boss CH-1 Super Chorus to add to the collection. After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit. I am certain there are units that may boast of being better but, I have found through my 40+ years of playing that more money is not always better.Great tones! Easy operation! And it is the best bet for the money!",positive
"I like the product a lot. For me, the only problem is the time of the ""sustainer effect"".It is not so long as I thought. I though it would be like the piano's sustainer. But it's a good pedal effect. My guitar get a good sound with the ""attack effect"". Thank you.",positive
"As several of the previous posters astutely mentioned, 'you will need a noise gate to use this pedal'. I completely agree with that. And it will sustain your notes. It will actually raise the volume to make them sustain. But you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up. The only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate. I use the NS-2 when I use my chain of pedals. That said, this pedals has some wonderful uses. Every note will have the same volume. You can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume. You can set it to sustain for days. Again, you will need a noise gate. There is nothing transparent about THIS compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors, but none of them are as ""ACTIVE"" as this one. Perhaps that's the price you pay for what this pedal can do. I recommend messing with it quite a while. You can do some incredible funk, jazz, metal vibes out of it.",positive
"Man this is perfect! Some people says that the cs3 is noisy but I thinks that depends on what type of electric conections you got at home or place you play, if you don't have a independent circuit for your pedalboard there's gonna be a lot of noise, most of all bcuz of the compression (obviously)... For me this is PERFECT, doesn't make any noise with my conections... Tottally recommend this!",positive
"The Boss CS3 is right for me, I have been using it with excellent results, I have many compressors, Line6, MXR, Behringer, Digitech, and although I alternate their use the Boss stands out on many rig configurations, it can feel a little bit overcompressed sometimes but in general a very good product, I highly recommended it as your main compressor, if you dont like it probably you dont know how to configure it, good luck.",positive
"It really pains me to give anything but a 5-star review to a BOSS product, since I'm such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall.  Those compliments apply equally to the CS-3 Compression Sustainer.  And it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less-reliable brand in my signal chain.However, there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know.  The two most common complaints that I see are that it adds ""noise"" to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit.  The former complaint is probably true, though if you're enough of a hobbyist to use a Compression Sustainer, you're probably already contemplated using a noise gate/suppressor, such as the BOSS NS-2.  Problem solved.As for the latter complaint (changes tone), that's also true, but it's not necessarily a bad thing if you LIKE the tone that results.  The whole point of the CS-3 is that it's supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it.  This can result in a muddy, ""neutered"" tone, though you can play with the TONE and other settings to help it.  I also find that with the settings all at 12 O'Clock, the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings.Really, while BOSS pedals are considered to be ""expensive"" compared to many of the other effects out there, the CS-3 should really be viewed as a ""budget"" or ""entry level"" compressor, when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a Keeley Compressor costing north of $200.  The best thing you can say about the BOSS (even compared to the similarly-priced MXR options) is that the CS-3 gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price.  The biggest negative of the pedal, in my opinion, is that the resulting sound might seem a little too...compressed.But there are a lot of things you could do with a CS-3, and it works best paired with other pedals (chorus, delay, some distortions) that you're trying to smooth out.  Ultimately, it's a pedal that could have been better, though there aren't too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of $100 anyway.",positive
"As a pro musician, I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board, I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner, Digital Delay (2 of them), Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really, really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the ""On"" position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars, especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own.",positive
"Guitarists have become a bunch of cork-sniffers. There are so many players more concerned with the name on the headstock of their guitar and their amp and the endless ""boutique"" pedals in their collections that many seem unable or unwilling to give a listen to ""stock"" gear, or anything that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.The fact is that if you're a gigging musician, and I am, you come to realize that all those subtle, detailed nuances of tone that so many want to obsess over get lost in the band mix, and in the poor acoustics of wherever you're playing.  Yes, we want to sound good to ourselves because that's inspiring, but frankly, I don't need $200+ dollar distortion/OD pedals to be inspired.I haven't owned a DS-1 in a long time, but recently got one because I was looking for a distortion pedal on a budget.  Frankly, I'd forgotten how musical this pedal is.  With the distortion set to minimum (it never gets clean) it's a good, moderate-gain overdrive that still lets your guitar's basic tone get through.  I play a strat & and jazzmaster - those guitars still sound like themselves with this thing.  With the gain at halfway you get great AD/DC crunch.  And even with the gain maxed out you still get excellent note definition on chords.  What more could you want?  Sure, it's ""old school"" rock distortion. The usual ""may not appeal to metalheads"" caveat applies, maybe. Combine this with an eq and you could scoop the mids as much as you want.I also have a Barber LTD (great, relatively cheap ""boutique"" moderate gain OD that doesn't break the bank) and a Visual Sound Route 66, which is a tubescreamer clone (with much more gain) and a compressor in one pedal.  Both the LTD & Rt 66 have the usual TS9 midrange hump, though much less pronounced on the LTD.  What's refreshing about the DS-1 is that the strong mids are there, but the overall tone is not in the same realm as a tubescreamer, so it can sit well on a pedalboard and bring a different flavor to the party.  The tone on the DS-1 can get very bright, but as I indicated I play with single coils, and I have no problem finding sweet spots on the tone knob - I generally run it around 9-10:00.Overall this pedal is a steal - look around and find a used one for a good price. I'd considered a modtone Speedbox, but decided to go with the generally bulletproof Boss instead, for basically the same price.  I couldn't be happier.",positive
"Think of this as an artist's tool.  And for every job there is the 'right' tool.  Is this the best distortion pedal?  That really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other gear/technique you are using with it.  If you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles.  It will not make your 15 watt solid state Ibanez Soundblaster amp sound like a raging Orange Rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like EMG 81/85s.  But arguing over what pedal is 'best' is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise.  This pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion- but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp - if that makes any sense. It it doesn't make sense, there are ample Youtube reviews you can check out before pulling the trigger.  It has been used by professional players like Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Kurt Cobain. It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians.  It's built like a brick and durable as all get-out.  I found mine used for $20, but the new asking price is fair. I would like to see Boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use, but admittedly I don't detect any tonesuck with it.  I've run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking.  It also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads.  With the exception of 'modeler' type pedals from companies like Tech 21, I do not think that any dirtboxes- this included- perform optimally when run into a solid state amp.  So if you are not happy with the way it is distorting your Marshall MG, the problem is in your amp.",positive
"I have had this pedal for about 15 years, just replaced the old one a month ago. It distorts sound, not quite the way you would imagine though. This effect sounds really good through a fat cab or a larger amp that can let the cabinet give the tone a little color. I use it through a Epiphone Valve Jr and a Marshall 2x12 stack with JTM45 on top and its fine. This thing through a Champ or smaller amp will not give you the meat you are probably looking for without a EQ pedal.This does just what it says it does. One Volume knob, one tone, and one distortion knob. CRANK IT.",positive
This pedal is a must have for any pedal board. I love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray. Thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best.,positive
"This was the first pedal I ever bought when I started playing guitar 15 years ago.  It's still in my primary set up!  The sound it puts out is very balanced:  you can get a subtle overdrive-like sound out of it, or a high-gain hard rock/80's metal sound out of it.  For those looking for insane crunch, this isn't for you.  Anyone that wants a nice, versatile pedal, this IS the one you want!",positive
"This is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says, it distorts, You want something to make your guitar sound like junk, this will do it. Why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me. This is not a boutique Distortion pedal like Hendrix would use. Boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.These things are built with heavy metal, it should last, I kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion",positive
"This is a distortion pedal. It will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl. It's pretty harsh in tone - kind of a white noise distortion. The DS-1 DOES NOT warm up the tone in your amp. You can dial the tone in, but it's a pretty harsh sounding.That said - the DS-1 does exactly what I wanted it to. My amp gives me a nice warm crunch, classic rock style. The DS-1 gives me the 80's metal and punk rock sound I wanted, and it does so flawlessly.It took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the DS-1. It's BOSS, so it will last forever.Th only drawback is that it's an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere. Usually Amazon catches up with that sort of thing, but word to the wise, don't pay more than $40 new for this thing.",positive
"I find that if I play this pedal along with my Boss Super Chorus pedal, my guitar with Tex-Mex pickups captures a lot Gilmour's sound tonality.",positive
"This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at $40. The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube amp.Different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise, it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.The guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals. Buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone.I may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass.",positive
"From Greg Abrams review, entitled ""For all but the tone snobs,"" a review further down on this product's page:""Alright, so you want to get a good (if somewhat ""basic"") distortion sound for less than $100? This is your deal.""I strongly disagree.  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less, even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.I've played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they're available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn't always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc...).So I plugged it in and didn't really care for it.  The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy.  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very likeable to me.  I've read the Japanese made DS-1's are better in sound than the newer, made in Taiwan models but, either way, the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.But, like many newer players, I didn't know any better at the time.  Fast forward a few years and I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals.  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.  All of them are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol' Amazon.com, and are rugged enough to last for years:Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I'm a Boss hater (I'm certainly not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I'll start with the DS-1's big brother.  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1, the II setting is a brighter, richer tone.  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2's all over ebay for very cheap prices.  A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many.Pro Co RAT2:  Great dirty distortion pedal.  Probably my personal favorite.  You've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years, its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists.  Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.  I've never heard a bad tone out of mine. Its great for getting a ""big amp"" kind of sound out of a small practice amp.  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume.  A truly excellent pedal.EHX Little Big Muff:  The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of songs.  Its kind of a fuzz, kind of a distortion, but definitely owns its own sonic territory.  Very big, saturated and warm.  Used heavily in the 70's for classic rock tones, also in the 90's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage.  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White.  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal.MXR Distortion +:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion, and can usually be found pretty cheap.  Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything, and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent, i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it doesn't cover over your equipments sound.  Used by quite a few famous folks, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II.  That's a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.  The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals.  Basically, its a pre-amp that sits on the floor.  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof.  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff, with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between.  It works well with any amp I've tried it on, and you can find tons of great sounds.  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal, and its even true bypass.  The best part is, Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30.  A true hidden gem that's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion:  This little guy surprised me.  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and, if so, that must be one awesome pedal too.  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box, and boy does it ever succeed at that.  Great crunch, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin' stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp, and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in), and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped, fantastic!Speaking of Joyo, I've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially theMOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moowhich honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played through).  So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz, od, and dirt pedals, check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere).Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for.  Also, if you can't actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you.  Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love, that's okay.  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information.  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that's affordable.  Find something you truly love and buy that.  If its the DS-1, one of the pedals I've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU.",positive
"Here's the deal with this pedal. It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money. In my opinion, for spending less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the MXR Badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it.",positive
"This is a little more expensive than some other brands, but i think it sounds great and it's way more durable than a plastic pedal.I'm pretty new to electric guitar so i'm not really a distortion and tone expert like some other reviewers.  To me this this sounds better and is easier to adjust than my modeling amp, so I think it's a good purchase.",positive
This is the best deal ever my first pedal was a zoom 505 gfx and it was really electronic and synthesized sounding alot of echos and stuff. Honestly the best effect it held was the phaser/jet pipe effect. I got this today and man it sounds so crisp clean and evenly distorted. It does the job distortion and sustain best buy for a best price!! bodow!!! from Trinidad!!,positive
"This pedal has been around for a long time, and though the overall quality has declined as Boss has cut corners to enable lower priced mass production of their pedals, the boss ds-1 remains the staple image of distortion stompbox's. The ds-1 is a no-frills tank of a pedal; it was designed to withstand a direct nuclear blast as well as Michael Moore stepping on it, so you know it can take any amount of punishment you might care to give it.This pedal doesn't replicate any type of amplifier-it's not a ""Marshall-in-a-box, or a mesa boogie, or a vox, or a Fender; from a tonal aspect it isn't complex or dynamic. It will add plenty of grind to your tone, and plenty of hum to go with it. If you're looking for your first distortion pedal to use with your 15-watt practice amp, look no further. If you have a decent tube amp, look elsewhere, because with this pedal, you get what you pay for, and it simply will not do a quality amp justice.Pros: Inexpensive, good build quality, distorts your signal.Cons: Lots of hum, the tone control gets really shrill really fast.Without the excessive hum and almost-unusable tone control, this would get 4 stars.",positive
I love these pedals. Inexpensive to purchase - easy to mod to your liking.This pedal received the gain and JCM mod.I will purchase more of these and will mod each and every one of them.This pedal is also good stock for a lead boost. Love this pedal.,positive
"There's some element of nostalgia with the DS-1 that I've just never understood.  I know they're cheap.  I know they're incredibly durable (as are all BOSS pedals).  I know everybody had one or tried one at some point, and Kurt Cobain (apparently) used them with his Fenders.But I also know that I've almost never been happy with the tone I get when I step on the pedal.  It's incredibly thin and harsh, and lacks proper sustain, even cranked all the way.  I've used it on Marshall solid state amps and Vox tube amps.  Fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers.  You can mess with the TONE and DIST dials all you want, but there has to be dozens of other affordable pedals, and even on-amp distortion, with a richer, deeper tone.Coincidentally, I also used the BOSS OS2 Overdrive/Distortion for many years, which is supposedly merges/blends a DS-1 with an OD-1.  That pedal isn't ideal either, but if I turn the knob all the way to ""distortion"", it's a much better tone than I ever got out of a DS-1.Then again, it is very dependable and usually only $40 (or less), so I can't really give it a bad review because it probably does belong in everyone's collection.  That just doesn't mean you'll want to use it all the time.",positive
"... it's a very generic-sounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp.  The same is true of many of the pedals from this era, including the (gasp!) Tube Screamer.  The Tube Screamer is a great lead boost into an already distorted amp, but not too many people will tell you that it's a great stand-alone distortion because it's not.  Same goes for the Boss DS-1.  Now, here's where things get interesting:  There are PLENTY of modifications that can be done to this pedal by Keely, Monte Allums, and others, that turn this otherwise mediocre pedal into a raging beast, dripping with tone and gain that sings for weeks.  For the cost of this pedal, and the $30 or so that it costs to get the materials for a mod, are well worth it.  Mine is modified with the Monte Allums Tri-Gain Rectifier modification and it's absolutely killer.  I use it as a lead boost, but by itself it's a nice overdriven tone that you'll find plenty of use for.  If you want a basic, solid, well-built distortion pedal, this is it - but by itself the Boss DS-1 is really nothing special.  But as a platform for great-sounding mods, you can't go wrong.",positive
"This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. It's very easy to use and rugged. If you play metal, you might want to get the HardWire TL-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount, if necessary) and more tone control, but it's also more expensive. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. The DS-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. I don't know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range.",positive
"First off I am no expert on these things but I can tell you in the brief period in which I have owned my DS-1 I have enjoyed playing/practicing a lot more with this pedal.  I have a Fender wannabe guitar, and a Fender Sidekick 10 which means my gear isn't the best but the pedal produces a wide variety of distortion and tone changes which keeps me interested.  I am having so much fun that I don't even notice my fingers hurt anymore.  Honestly, this is an essential buy when starting out along with headphones and a cord extension so the police don't come a knockin.(update Sept 2012)It is a year later and I have a much better guitar and amp and a lot more knowledge.  I am glad I got the DS-1 but for other reasons.  Sure it made me enjoy playing and practicing a lot more but I soon found the sound was off considering I like more blue and classic rock.  Again for the money I dont think you can beat it but more importantly when you have a few buck you can send it out for modification from Keeley.  Initially I had wished I went with and overdrive (OCD or Boss OD-3) but with the mod done by Keeley I have a super flexible pedal that cover just about all the sounds I need.  In closing, spend the $40 buck and get this....and then when you start wishing it could do more send it off to be modified and you will thank yourself later.",positive
Good metal distortion tone with bags of sustain but sucks a lot of tone (most metal pedals do) and is moderately noisy. If you are looking for classic rock sounds you won't find them here. Can get muddy at times but there are plenty of settings to tweak to get the sound you are looking for. I find it useful for high gain leads and palm mute rhythms but note definition is not so good with chords. For the price this pedal is a good deal though!,positive
"I've had this for about 11 years now. Even with some of the newer metal pedals on the market, this pedal still sells well. Not to mention, it's probably also one of the most modded pieces out there. Any number of mods can be found online to change the sound. They're usually on the side of improving the stock tone, which I'm happy with.I've always liked the parametric EQ on this pedal. The variable midrange allows me to get Marshall or Mesa flavors. For most metal/hard rock music, the gain range is enough for me. If I need yet more gain, I punch it up with an overdrive, or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost. Even without a boost, I can use it for death metal. I think if you play the tighter, more technical styles, it's better not to have too much gain anyhow.",positive
"To be honest, I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB. So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet, but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great, only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock, or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp, but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal.",positive
"I have a lot of pedals...  In fact, I have 2 distortion and 2 overdrive pedals (though only the MT2 and the OD3 are regularly in my rig.)  This pedal won't give you a ""cranked up tube stack"" sound.  No...  Instead, it's very edgy and smooth as can be.  It has a mid-sweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone.  I usually use it as a mid-boost for solos.  You'll find that you get amazing sustain and a huge sound that you won't be able to replicate (easily... I'm sure the huge Boss distortion box comes close, but for the price...) with any other pedal.",positive
"I bought mine used three years ago and it works great. It works for a Metallica, Pantera type sound. You can also get good rock sounds with the gain turned down and eq. adjusted.",positive
"Its a great pedal, sound really crunchy, I got a peavy vyper sometime I use this If I want a crunchy style, but the amp I got is really good and has its own distortion styles, I use the heavy metal config on this pedal, I recomend it to anyone... does not introduce noise, I run it on the stock battery, it still works, you can make your guitar sound like Metallica or Megadeth, of course it also depends on a lot of things, like pickups, amp, etc..., I also have a very old little peavey practice amp, this blows away the distortion that it has with less noise and gives it a new life.Listen to it on the Boss website, I heard to it and then I thought the sound was not going to be similar because of the equipment used by them, but it does sound really really close. regards. forgive my english... not from the U.S",positive
"BY FAR the best distortion pedal out there. No doubt about that. Several of my friends use this pedal, and they all love it. I also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal. It's great for medal. It have a nice punch to it along with a great &#34;cut&#34; so you're palm mutes don't blend into each other like other pedals. There are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations. AMAZING",positive
"First of all I want to say I love a tube amp distortion.  Overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be.  I run a Randall G3 hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state I've used or heard.  For recording I use a Peavey 5150 and its so sweet.  Tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard.Recently I started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that I felt like could only be achieved through a pedal.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals, I used the DOD death metal for years when I first started playing.  However, there is a downside.  Go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old AM radio, if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least $250.  Quality dist. pedals are not budget friendly.I chose the MT-2 because I know Boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using.  It gives a variety of sounds.  It can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones.  The controls make it very tweakable and I have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it.  Read the included book, look up some MP3s over videos online and check out other guitarists' settings.  It will help you tame this pedal into what you want.  Perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot.  There are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful.I've seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz.  I must say learn how to shape sound, spend time dialing it in to your rig.  Within 10 minutes I was pleased with the MT-2.  I used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick, heavy distortion with a good response.I say the MT-2 is worth an investment if you're looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal.  Surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board.",positive
"This is a great pedal I picked up used, they can be had cheaply on the used market. I actually use it with both an acoustic electric guitar to get a little distortion and the bass guitar for some grit. The 2 EQ pots on the front panel make it very versatile, enough to use with a cigar box guitar also.The pedal can preserve bass signal and still be EQ'd for saturated distortion. The other reviews speak for this pedal both here and on other sites and one can see why it is so popular. I also other Boss Distortion pedals. Like most people, I own a DS-1 and an MD-2 which are both cheap and effective. I own a HM-2 Heavy Metal 2 which caters more to the traditional metal sound and I actually think this pedal is more versatile IMO with different guitars where you may not want a strictly metal tone.I also own an older 80's HM-2 Heavy Metal which will run circles around the metal zone for classic thrash and speed metal tones and almost any other heavy distortion pedal that I could never part with, overall i like this pedal, but it cannot top the older legendary Boss pedals.",positive
Bought it as a gift. Friend loved it very much.,positive
"I love BOSS pedals. I owned a DS-1 (Distortion) and a MT-2 (Metal Zone) for years, and loved them both. This one, is a good ""meet in the middle"" of those two. It's great if you want some really good bluesy distortion, or you can crank the color and get some thick distortion.As always, this pedal is very well constructed and sturdy. I love it.",positive
"This pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years.  It really does have a ton of range, although it only does one effect at a time, so you'd have to reach down and change the knobs mid-show in order to get the other variations.  My most commonly used setting was with the overdrive-distortion mix knob at about 2 o'clock, which produces a very professional sounding Grunge-type effect.  If you want any of those 90's sounds, excluding the heavier metal sounds, this pedal will definitely get you there.",positive
"very simple, very user-friendly,and the feature that is most important i think, versatile. the OS/DS and drive knobs allow you to chose between a very different bunch of tones. and also, for the money, a great deal. 100% recommended.",positive
"I first used this pedal when my green screemer died. A friend had and os-2 on hand and let me use it. I had used Boss's metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking. So I plug into the OS-2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS-2 pedal produced. I play through a '59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones. I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed. I have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end, my search ended with this pedal. I highly recomend this pedal to any rock, blues, metal, country, or punk guitar player.",positive
"It's a good OD, but I thought it would be higher output, and more articulate. Just personal preference. I mean, the Pedal is a Classic for a reason.",positive
"This thing freaking rocks! I LOVE this pedal. I can't stop using it. Sometimes I just play long, drawn out chords so I can listen to this amazing tone [in combo with distortion on my amp - it's perfect metal!!]",positive
excellentI like I am very happyI am looking for money for the following purchase for amazonthe pedal boss arrives in the time necessary thank you,positive
"For the money, I have no complaints.  The enclosure, dials, and footswitch are all durable.  Not true bypass, but none of the BOSS pedals are.  It doesn't suck tone.  This pedal isn't the end-all be-all overdrive, but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that TS pedals don't. You lose a little low end when it is engaged, but that actually works pretty well for leads- especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of 'classic' distortion encountered with EL84s.  As a stand alone overdrive, I prefer other pedals.  But where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp.  You get singing, harmonic leads when it is dialed in right.  Like any overdrive, you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far.  I am a dirtbox hoarder and I like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations.  Lately, I am running this into either the V1 Cool Cat transparent overdrive (Timmy Clone - very, very nice) or the Behringer BO-100 (which is a dead ringer for the Boss Blues Driver) then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch (Jet City Combo or Palomino Combo).  As with any overdrive, this thing will not sound very good (IMHO) running into a solid state amp.  That's just not what it was intended to do. It was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but YMMV. Because I'm a cheapskate (and because these things are durable like bricks) I bought it used for $20, but it is well worth the new asking price.",positive
"It's yellow, its metal, its Boss.  If you want your drive sound to have definition this is the pedal to get.  The best OD I have ever owned.  Makes me want to see if my tone could cut board in half.",positive
"I picked this up in order to boost my gain on my amp a bit.  It does a wonderful job of that (Drive set low and the level set high.  Tone set to taste.)  The additional noise it produces is relatively low, so you won't have any excessive staticy buzzing sound to deal with.  As with any other Boss pedals, it's well made and reliable.",positive
"Bought one of these 15 yrs ago used and it died a couple years back. This is one of my favorite overdrive pedals ever. Smooth tone, the right amount of gain, perfect to push a tube amp. Plus there are now dozens of (DIY or pro) mods available which add a lot more potential. Recommended.",positive
"I bought this pedal used and have used it with both a Fender tube amp and a Marshall solid state using clean channels. I can get a variety of tones from it with different guitars, and reccomend it as a first overdrive or to add to a collection.While I have several overdrive pedals, this one is good at giving some basic overdrive tones while keeping the amps low end. I can get decent tones from a Telecaster and Les Psul by keeping the level and tone knobs below 12 o'clock and adjusting the drive to taste.The OD sounds great through Fender clean tubes and I also tried it with a bass guitar. With some adjustment of the tone and drive knob, the bass has an overdriven tone with a good drive.The other reviews here prove this pedal is typical and iconic Boss in build quality. I find the Boss pedals good for their purpose and have mostly modded the ones I've owned after some time, but I may keep this one as is and use it as a boost. These pedals last forever and I only paid $20 for mine.",positive
I use this pedal all the time now even more than the DS-1 . Great chrunch for the buck From classic blues to rock its very eash to dial the sound you want in.,positive
"I held out from trying the Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive for many years.  Like many guitarists, my first distortion pedal was a Boss DS-1, which was durable and aggressive, but also extremely frustrating.  I might have formed some negative impressions about Boss, when it was probably unfair to do so.The SD-1 is widely owned and very affordable (usually around $50).  It's similar in a lot of ways to the Ibanez TS-9 Tubescreamer, except that a Tubescreamer reissue costs twice as much.  A lot of guitarists consider the SD-1 to be more of a ""rock"" overdrive, while the TS-9 is more of a ""tube/blues"" effect.  There's probably some truth to that, but both of them are excellent pedals.However, the SD-1 really impressed me with its transparency and versatility.  You CAN simply plug into it and use it alone with a clean channel.  But that isn't necessarily the best use for the pedal - it excels as a ""booster"" pushing an already overdrive amp, or stacking with other distortion/OD pedals.  One of the best settings is turning the Level all the way up and the gain all the way down.  This adds just a little bit of grit to your tone, and really sounds great.A feel that lot of people give the SD-1 mediocre reviews for reasons that aren't fair.  You hear things like ""it cuts out too much bass"", when that's really what the pedal is supposed to do.  The midrange hump, when set up properly, can take away the muddiness of your tone and help you cut through a band during live playing.  And, like I said before, I feel as if it's MORE transparent in retaining elements of the clean tone than the TS-9, though preference between the two is entirely subjective.But you also know that it's a Boss pedal, which means it's as durable as they come.  The thing will stand up to years of abuse, and can be used in any number of roles.  If you're looking for a single pedal to make a small amp sound ""big"", there are probably better options in this range.  (Try the under-appreciated MD-2 Mega Distortion, or the excellent Joyo Ultimate Drive).  But if you understand what this pedal is supposed to do and use it for that purpose, you'll understand why this thing has been popular for over 30 years.",positive
"Great as a booster, as others have said. For solos, it'll boost your mids and your signal. As an overdrive, it's great, kind of a midsy, Marshally sound. It does suck out some of the low end, but you can fix that on your amp or board or whatever. It's a Boss, it's solid - and a great price. Remember, this is overdrive - not distortion. For distortion, look at other Boss pedals.",positive
"I have several overdrive pedals, some of which are much more expensive than the BOSS SD-1. For a long time I overlooked my SD-1 and used other pedals. But when I went back to trying the SD-1, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this relatively inexpensive pedal is superior to some of the pedals I had been using. I don't mean merely that it's ""very good relative to its price""; I mean that it's ""very good--period."" It easily outclasses some pedals for which I paid much more. The price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about $45 on Amazon. At that price, it's an amazingly good deal. Note: This is definitely an overdive pedal; it will not deliver metal distortion (at least not by itself). If you want to ride the crazy train, look elsewhere (like Deltalab's Metal Distortion pedal). What this produces is smooth old-style overdrive. It's excellent. It sounds especially good through a dash of chorus. I plug my SD-1 into a Fender Mustang II amp and turn on the amp's chorus; the result is delicious. I've used the SD-1 with both single-coil and double-coil pickups. Both sound good, though, not surprisingly, you get a heavier punch with a humbucker. But it sounds great with single-coils too.",positive
"Forget all the volume drop comments.  There isn't any and it does not color your tone one bit.  I have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals. They were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in.  I wanted something to dress up slow ballads, and of course ""Born On The Bayou"".  This pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it.  And no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on. I play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it.",positive
"Sure there are fancier Tremolo pedals out there, but I've always been a fan of the Boss TR-2. It's got a more mellow and vintage Fender Tremolo output, and suits my playing to a T. Pair this beauty up with an Electro-Harmonix Cathedral Reverb pedal, and get lost for days. Definitely worth the reasonable cost!",positive
This tremelo pedal works nicely and it's great when you're playing through an amp without tremelo. Problem solved! The price was also very good.,positive
"This is a great Tremolo pedal.It is very quiet and when used correctly, there is absolutely no signal drop or volume drop whatsoever.You can blend the Tremolo type from a smooth sinuous pulsing waveform to a sharper edged ""on/off"" type tremolo.Tremolo varies the volume of the sound. It does not vary the pitch.You have control over the ""depth"" or ""amount"" of effect, and you can control how fast the effect pulsates the sound.A very simple, popular effect that I wouldn't want to live without in some form or another.Pretty teal green color.As with all Boss products they are built like a tank and generally last forever if they are not abused or damaged.I have no idea how fast this pedal eats batteries because I use a power supply.There is no on/off clicking when depressed.There is no added hiss, hum or distortion.The battery compartment is easily accessed without having to unplug anything.Simply a great effect and quality product from Boss and tends to hold its resale value well.",positive
"I've played this pedal for a while now and really dig it. I'm old school, Fender Blues Deluxe reissue and Strats and Teles, this pedal has a great, warm, organic feeling tremolo that I use a lot. You can barely bring it in for some warmth, or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect.I'll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck. This effect will give you a nice almost Hammond B-3 type of organ sound.",positive
"This is a superb tremolo pedal: [1] Its dials allow for enormous control of the effect. [2] It's very sturdy--an often-noted feature of BOSS pedals. Further, [3] it's utterly easy to use, [4] allows for both 9v battery and power supply/adapter operation, and, most important of all, [5] it delivers beautiful tremolo. (Note: It comes with a 9v battery installed, but it does NOT come with a power source/adapter.) If the price is more than you're willing to pay, consider the DANELECTRO COOL CAT TREMOLO. This also delivers good tremolo, but it does not allow for as much sound-manipulation as the BOSS product; it's still quite good, but the BOSS takes the prize. I paid about $75 for mine and have zero regrets.",positive
"I own three units capable of tremolo: Boss TR-2, Line 6 MM4, and the Boss SL-20 Slicer (like a tremolo on steroids). Plus my amp is a Twin Reverb so it too has tremolo. If you are unfamiliar, tremolo modulates the volume as if turning it up and down rapidly.The Boss TR-2 is the simplest of the three stompboxes to operate, with three controls: ""Rate"" of modulation, ""Depth"" of modulation (how much does the volume vary), and a ""Wave"" shape (jagged, square, or somewhere on a continuum in between). Unlike the other Boss stompboxes I own (CE-5 & PH-3), the TR-2 does not seem to compress sound so that it seems like you're ""playing in a fishbowl"" (as another reviewer puts it).The ""Wave"" control is what gives the unit its sonic versatility, so it is a nice feature to have. Most tremolos have it, but not all. For the price, it can give you a decent set of classic tremolo sounds with nothing too crazy. It is the unit that Tom Morello uses on ""Guerilla Radio,"" and it does well with tremolo classics like the Smiths ""How Soon Is Now?"" I hear no volume drop problem like other reviews suggest, and this is something I am sensitive to because I generally turn modulations on/off over the course of a song rather than leave them on full time.Like all Boss stuff, the box is sturdy and I like their big, quiet footswitches over any of the little, clicky ones on other units. The color is a sort of a dull military dark green, not the most attractive thing but not bad either.The small Boss effects do not come with a power cable, so you will have to factor that into the cost. Boss instructions tell you that you need their particular adapter, but I don't know anyone who says this is a must. I run it off a pedalboard power supply and it seems to work fine. If it didn't I would not buy Boss product period.Bottom Line:(1) Gives a decent array of basic tremolo sounds, nothing crazy(2) Not a bad price (factor in a power cable)(3) Simple to operate(4) Nice casing and footswitch; drab color",positive
"Bought it for using Danelectro mini amp, so I don't need to worry about the battery.  It works perfectly as an adaptor should be, & you won't have any surprise by its performance. :)  two stars out because of comparing the price with the mini amp (less than $20), the adaptor is pricy ($8.50), but it still saves me $$ for the long runs.",positive
"I got this to power my Danelectro Honeytone amp since it eats batteries like candy.  It's a power adaptor, so it isn't too exciting, but it works fine.",positive
I use this mostly with my Honeytone mini amplifier and Reel Echo tape echo simulator. Works very well with no problems. A lot of Danoelectro pedals may eat up batteries and this is a great alternative when you have access to Ac voltage outlets.,positive
"I was having some problems with my Ego Compressor comp getting noisey, sent it back and found out that It Had been using a slightly drained battery, so I got one of these and it is great, nice and quiet again, half the price of the boss one.",positive
"This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I've used, and I've used many over the last three decades. It's exceptionally quiet, which many are not, and it puts out 9.6 volts, which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!I've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals, but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit. Still, that's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers, not a box on the floor. But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay, and a little extra gain driving the tubes, and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of, including the Boss ones. Dan has released some cool, well-made pedals in the past 15 years, and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.A very good deal at 15 clams.",positive
"As stated in the title, this adapter is what you need if you use your Danelectro a lot and are going through too many batteries. You can now plug it into the wall! As advertised, it keeps electric current hum to a minimum and has functioned fine for the year or so I've owned it. The reason I took off one star is because the wire is really thin and doesn't seem too durable, so because of this I have been very careful so it doesn't get broken. You might be able to find an off-brand adapter for cheaper but this one is made for the Honeytone so you won't risk ruining it.",positive
"...is a must if you have any of the Danelectro/FAB pedals.  As anyone who has one of these pedals knows they eat 9-volts like candy, this is the solution.  You get one of these and hook it up to a power splitter (Search for Visual Sound One Spot Multi-Plug 5 Cable) and you are good to go for up to 5 pedals!  No more battery swaps, no more searching for a 9-volt every 5 minutes...",positive
What can I say lower priced than most and very low distortion I could Not hear the hum but for multi pedals to save on cost I use a godlyke power supply but this Is a good power pack.,positive
Got this to use with the Behringer compressor I ordered with this. They are not indicated as compatible but it worked great! Price was right. I already own two and had no problems. Quiet. No hummmmm. Buy it if you need a wall wart.,positive
"My first wah was a Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie. I loved it. It's a switchless pedal that I put through hell. I had it for 3 months before I had to send it back cause it broke. It's still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal ""open"" to achieve a certain warm sound. That's when I went looking at the cry baby.At the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up. I put this one against the Hendrix, Classic, and 95-Q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best. The only one that sounded better was the 535Q but at over $200 it was out of my price range. I paid $97+tax for my GCB-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny. I don't even touch my Morley anymore. It's cry baby all the way",positive
"I've been using a Crybaby for going on 30 years now.  Some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way.  Well, I've never noticed.To me these always feel perfect.  Also, you can adjust which part of the sweep you're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little ""comb"" that moves the wheel on the pot.I've tried other wahs.  Morley doesn't do it for me, and the Vox is very good, I just have always gone with what I knew.  No complaints with the Crybaby.",positive
"I got this pedal cause is not so expensive, and I love music. I used to play in big concerts but no more but I can tell you that for the price is good who ever wants to have some fun and learn how to use a pedal.",positive
"Well, just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours...Now that's a Fun king wah wah!!It's big, it's hard and it's heavy but when you turn it on you understand why this is the original. It sounds exactly like how i always imagined, like in all those records...This one gets the big 5 for being everything i wanted it to be!",positive
"MY experience with crybaby is it has a great tone.  More overbearing than the Vox or cleaner wahs.  BUT I know several people who have had problems with the switch, and I have watched countless others stomping on their crybaby in futile attempts to engage or disengage the pedal.I actually use a BBE and Vox since this frustration with my 1st wah.  But I am not sure that I am giving up tone in exchange for the headache avoidance!  I kinda think I am.  The VOX and BBE seem to have a brighter sound which is less ""wah-ed"" if you will.  It could be accentuated by me playing a Strat instead of the Les Paul Custom/Boogie combination I used with the crybaby.",positive
"Great pedal, but if you pull it open and put in a couple of cheap mods, this thing is absolutley rediculous!  It's a boutique pedal with only a little time and solder.",positive
"WaWa pedals come and go, and get modded and re-thunk....But I always wanted an original Cry Baby... So this was a birthday gift to myself.Not disappointed.Down the road I MAY add some of the gazillions of electronic mods available now to personalize the sound, but for the time being I'm gonna enjoy this pedal ""As-Shipped"".Very Good Buy, Great packaging, earlier-than-expected delivery - Thanks Amazon !",positive
"My Cry Baby is about 20 years old and is the oldest pedal on my board. I have rewired it for true bypass and replaced the Potentiometer to give the Wah a broader range but it really doesn't sound any better. This pedal covers the &#34;White Room&#34; by Cream Tone perfectly. I gave it 4 stars because it hasn't been maintenance free. The pot came loose and the switch had to be replaced but considering the fact that it survived several hundred gigs in smoky dives, I probably should give it 5.",positive
"Sounds like my original.  Enough said.  Great pedal and it is still built like a tank.  I do appreciate that on this version, one can use a pretty standard AC adapter. A+.",positive
"The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on, which produces a sound.  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch, so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle, and just leave it there.  You can't really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah, but in my experience, the sound is equivalent on the base models.",positive
this is my first petal of  any kind.  I had read that the Wah shoud be your first so I went with that.  glad I did.  this Wah petal is so much fun.  you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow.  It is hours and hours of fun.  the sounds are great.  I have had no problem with performance.  it works as it should.  I highly recommend this petal.  it's price is attractive as well.,positive
I love this wah. It's just perfect. I really can't find any negative about it. It's just a perfect standard wah. You won't regret this purchase at all. Just put a good analog fuzz after it & you're good to go.,positive
I've got a MXR MC404 CAE for my concert line pedals... but this one is the one I use for local gigs and home use with Fender Telecaster and Hot Rod.,positive
"Finally broke down and got a new one after my original crybaby bought in 1976 finally died. A great pedal, well made!",positive
"If you want your guitar to sound like Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound, then get a BOSS GT-10 (guitar multi effects processor) and install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg. Search Google for BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.",positive
"It is a good pedal, but it just doesn't have the sound I was looking for. It is great for playing funk music, but for us metal heads, the wah is just too weak. For metal artists, I would recommend looking elsewhere. I am going to look into getting an Ibanez Weeping Demon, or a Morley, or whatever it is Behringer is limping to the barn with these days.",positive
"""Oh its a crybaby"", ""I have a crybaby wah"", ""You suck because you don't own a crybaby""...I'm tired of hearing these statements from guitarists that are so fresh they couldn't even tell you how many strings their instrument has!  This wah pedal just doesn't cut it.  Maybe at one time, but not today, it hasn't been up to par in a LONG time.  As a young player I insisted on having a wah pedal.  My mom bought me this one.  I thought it was awesome until I learned better.  It took me about a week to learn how to turn it on and when I finally did I thought I broke it!The eq on this pedal isn't good, there is no smooth transition from heel to toe.  There is a big drop in the freq. that kills the effect.  You have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop.  You have to pretty much push it toe foward and then literally stomp on it to turn it on and then follow the same steps to turn it off.  Very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board.  I can't say its just a complete piece of junk, it does give you a wah effect, it is a classic pedal but THERE IS BETTER out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing?  I even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue, I still had to slam on it to turn it on/off and it still sounded like a cheap wah.My suggestion?  The Mark Tremonti wah is great!  Kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use!  It may cost more, but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway, so just go with the Tremonti Power Wah to begin with.  What I use for wah is the Digitech RP250 processor.  You may say that this is a cheap processor, and it is, but I've been using it for years and I haven't seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters.  Why I suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity, how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on (I have mine set fairly light) and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily.  You even have presets (crybaby being one of them)  You can get an entire processor full of effects AND an awesome wah for a little bit more.If you want a cheap child's gimic-type toy, this is for you.  Want to get serious about a wah?  Spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere.",positive
"I've had my wah pedal for a number of years now. What I can say is that it has put up with a lot of use, no problem with the pedal itself, mechanically. However, the cheap rubber feet were the first victims of perhaps taking a few cheaper short cuts on producing the product. That is to say, the rubber feet began to come off in no time. If you mount it on a pedal board, you will probably remove those feet and this won't be a problem. Also, the power supply that comes with it does a stellar job of powering the pedal. If you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable, at least on my unit, the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts. Those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat. What I have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push ALL THE WAY in, otherwaise, ZAP. Other than those two issues, the power issue really no fault of Dunlop's if you use the supplied power cable, its been a great pedal. A classic that will surely live on.",positive
"the orig, still the best! do you like guitar music? chances are good you know the sound this pedal makes. it is the one. my only stand alone outside a multi effects unit",positive
"The Cry Baby has proven itself since the 60's. It is a very well made pedal that is a must have, if you play any classic rock. It takes a bit of practice to master, but when you have mastered it; you can take your music to a different level.",positive
"It sounds good but it adds soooo much noise to my pedal board. If that's not a problem, definitely worth the price.",positive
"Some things just don't need to change. Some Wah pedals try to tempt you with built in fuzz, eq, or other wacky add-ons but WHY? I'd rather have one pedal that does its job perfectly than a pedal that does a bunch of stuff but sounds less than great. The Crybaby is a great effect to have for any style; everyone from Jack White to Jimmy Hendrix have used some incarnation of this pedal. It's a must have and that's really all there is to say.",positive
"I acknowledge that this is a minority opinion - perhaps I just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards.  But while I loved the sound and functionality of this wah-wah pedal, it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable.  I suspected that the potentiameter was shot, so I had that replaced, but the same problems reoccurred.  Like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it.Good product, but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit I had.",positive
I keep a capo in each instrument nothing wore than showing up without one. I am using this on my Martin 12-string. The spring holds tight but can easily be adjusted with one hand.,positive
Best 12-string capo I have ever used--and that's over decades.  Works easily and flawlessly.  Very well made.  Five Stars,positive
This is my 6th Kyser capo.  This one for my new Ovation 12 String CC245 is what I needed.  I always recommend all Kyser Capos.They last forever and do not lose the strong holds.,positive
does what is designed to do easy to use seems sturdy should serve me well for years to come ...was not too expensive for such good quality,positive
If you play 12 acoustic you gotta get this one.  Just a hair longer on the padded area which is what  you need.  You can tell them from the 6 string version by the ridges being much closer together on this one.,positive
"This capo does exactly what it should.  It clamps the strings tight to there is no buzz and it does not change the tune of the guitar when used.  I have 4 Kyser capos, one for each of my guitars and will never buy another brand.",positive
"This is for theKyser Banjo/Mandolin CapoThis is one of three capos I use for a ukulele.  It works, and is my second favorite.  I can park it on the headstock of my ukulele, and it is easy to add, move, remove. With the trigger-type release, it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used. It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  I like how the trigger portion sticks upwards, and does not get in the way like myDunlop Trigger Banjo Capo, Black.  My favorite is still the G7th capo.  This is a close second to the G7th.My only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for Amazon Prime.  UPDATE:  I just saw that this capo is eligible for Amazon Prime.  Free shipping for Prime members!!!For the price and quality, this Kyser capo works on a uke. Highly recommended.",positive
"works great, stays out of the way... cant ask for much more than that. (and expect to get it) the price was half of what i was locally.",positive
It says for a Banjo or a Mandolin but ukulele is the first instrument listed on the box. It is just the right size to clamp over four strings and taking it on/off is really easy.,positive
"Costs about 2x as much as some cheap capos, and it's worth every single penny.  THis has a strong clip, yet does not damage my concert or tenor ukulele necks.  It won;t budge once you clip it, and it's low profile.  Made of metal, it should last a lifetime.I took off one star only for one thing: the hand clip portion of this does sometimes get in the way of fretting because it sticks out from the neck quite a ways.  Some other capos, like this oneJim Dunlop 7828 Russell Banjo/Uke Capodoes not have anything that you can hit your hand on when fretting.  Sometimes I try the Kyser on the opposite side, away from me, the player.  But, it seems to still hit my hand on some chords, just different ones.  That said, I can work around it, and it's a lifelong capo of fantastic build and keeps those strings from buzzing at all on all my ukes. If one was to have large hands, as I do not, this interference may be even more of an issue to consider.C ya.  Happy strumming.  Mahalo.",positive
"A very strong capo..too strong for bigger instruments, but works good on ukes and mandolins and banjos with not too thick of a neck.  I have several of these capos, one for each instrument.",positive
"Bought this for my husbands Mandolin and he loves it, it works great, we swear by Kyser that's all we use on our guitars is Kyser capos, great product, no complaints and the price is worth it.",positive
"Works great with my Baritone Ukulele.  Same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo.  Easily fits in my ukulele case, too.",positive
It's a very cute little capo. It works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course it's hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are VERY small. But it works.,positive
"Although this capo is marked as correct for a mandolin, it only works correctly above the 3rd or 4th fret on my mandolin. Any lower on the fretboard than that and this capo doesn't have enough pressure to work on the 1st or 2nd fret position on my mandolin, even though my mandolin has a fairly low action.I have a number of Kyser capos and very much like the style (I own at least six Kyser guitar capos and use them on all of my guitars from a Taylor 12-String to a Fender American Strat without any problems), but in this case the banjo capo didn't work for what I need. Perhaps the capo sent to me was defective, although I have enough decades of experience with stringed instruments to know that it didn't seem broken, just not up to the task.From feedback others have sent to me it is possible this capo may work for you if you wish to take a chance on it, but I know that I don't have time while on stage to take 20 seconds to set a fussy capo 'just right' to make sure it is holding just right and then hope it doesn't start to buzz on me in the middle of a song. I went with another brand after talking to some bluegrass guys who had better luck with another style of mandolin capo.",positive
I use this capo all the time on both instruments. A friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also. I did and they love it!,positive
"I have several types of capos, this one seems well built.  A little bulky for 5 string banjo especially if you are fingering near it.  I really don't need to change that fast so use it very little, might use more in a performance setting but that is a ways off.",positive
It's a good banjo capo.  Inexpensive  and it works well without squeezing the strings out of tune. End of story,positive
"I've been using one of these Kyser's for a good while now. I only have one so it usually stays with the mandolin but works just as well for my banjo. If you never used one, it's makes it MUCH easier to change keys although I usually only use it when I'm playing chords, when I solo I like to play with open strings and this makes it a breeze to pop off and put back on. With a little practice you'll be able to do it quickly without having the strings buzz.",positive
"This is such a nice bag for the price.  Nicely padded with an ample zip compartment that can hold your snark, capo, or whatever.  There is a handle and a shoulder strap.  Plus, it is reallly a nice looking bag, black with a little white trim in front.",positive
"These are the best strap locks in my opinion, good quality, easy to install and remove, secure, and they look good.  All my guitars have these locks on them and I'm very satisfied.",positive
"In particular, I favor the Dual Design. Why? If the need arises, it's possible to use a regular strap that doesn't have the button locks installed. I have two of the black ones on a 7 string Ibanez RG7321, and Laguna LE200QBC guitars. I have spare straps for both guitars, and sometimes I lock those spares with the plastic Dunlop discs.I have some older bass guitars with similar Dunlop locks (the standard version), two of which had locks installed in the mid 1990's, and one from 2003 with the gold DD. All three of them have held up with no issues. I didn't need to re-tighten the screws on those guitars until about two years ago. Then again, I don't tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as ... MetallicA. ;)",positive
"yes, if your willing to swap out strap locks with originals these work fine...i did have a problem with drilling new holes into my guitars...but its explained what  size bit to use so wasnt a big problem...i tried not to drill on most of my guitars  some fit without drilling some did not..good luck...good price welll made..",positive
"best strap locks ive ever used, dunlop has always had great products.easy to install and i highly recomend them to any bass player",positive
Almost dropped my bass on the floor a couple days before i got these bad boys. When I put them on I felt confident that I wouldn't have that issue anymore. It's easier to strap up because of the quick release tab. This should be every bassist/guitarist's best friend.,positive
"I tried this model a few years ago, and I never had a problem with them (once I got it installed), but I went back to the Schallers I had on my other instruments.  I thought (and this has been mentioned by others) that it makes the strap stick too far out from the instrument, which I thought looked goofy.  I also didn't particularly care for the push button release, and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge; these have a C clamp, not a nut, so there's no allowance for differing thickness. I also felt safer with the Schallers, which hook onto the end of the guitar strap button and didn't depend on a spring loaded button to keep the parts together.  As I said, I had no real problems with them, so if they look like they'd work for you, great.  As with all replacement strap locks/buttons, you have to make sure the screws are secure in the button holes before you start jumping off of drum risers, dropped out of airplane, or what have you.",positive
"I had to actually follow the instructions and drill holes as specified, then it worked like a charm!  Glad I got them, much less hassle tuning up for a gig.",positive
These strap locks were easy to install and use right off the bat. You may have to drill deeper holes into your guitar in order to use them. Just follow the instructions and you can easily attach and detach your strap whenever you feel like it.,positive
I've tried a few different straplock options and these are the best. Not only do they securely hold the strap to the guitar they also look pretty good. Highly recommend.,positive
"Great product, I've use them before and have always thought they were top quality.  They aren't much larger than the originals that came with the guitar and that extra piece of mind is great!  Easy installation without any modification (at least on mine) and they connect/hold very solid.  Just make sure the buttons are all the way in or you could have mishap ;)",positive
"they work well. For me, the instalition wasn't that hard, it took me maybe four or five minutes. The screws provided were a bit bigger than my BC Rich Avenge Beast's stock strap system, BUT when you read the directions and lube the screws up with a small amount of bar soap (or wax- i used the bar soap though) the installation becomes easier.Once you put your strap in, its NOT comming out unless you try hard to undo the system, lol.If you need to clean your guitar strap, take off the locking pin and use a flat head screw drive to pop off the retainer clip. Its a quick and harmless way to do it and it may take about a minute or two to undo both strap locks. Its not that hard though and the reward is worth it.",positive
"No complaints about this hardware.  Easy to install with patience, easy to use.  The click on/off system securely holds your strap, and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the post.These work like a light switch...on/off, so I'm not sure how you can rate them as poor.  There aren't really any directions, so it takes a little mechanical knowledge (just a little...it's not rocket science) to make them work.Quality metal, secure function, and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts.I've installed these on a 3/4 Hoener, Full Sized Squire Acoustic, and 2 Fender Strat's.",positive
"After receiving theDunlop Dual Design Straplok Systemalready installed on my Gibson Standard electric(7.36 lbs.), and liking them, I decided to try installing them on my Gibson Studio electric (7.23 lbs.). Noproblem. Just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly.I had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation. Money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground. Besides safety I also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars. It's a nice convenience. If you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars.If you are not sure if they will work on your brand guitar seek out an online forum and either search thatforum for the answer or join and ask your questions. You've got a pricy piece of wood there and will wantto take care of it properly.What I don't care for, but feel okay with because they work so well, is how big they seem to be. Theydon't get in the way when being used but look almost out of place. That is why I chose Black for mysecond set. Helps keep the product's profile down a bit. Other than that, the product works asadvertised....NOTE: As of June 2014 I have installed two other sets and all are still working as expected. Do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure. After repeated use the screws can come loose and therewill be trouble if this happens. Do NOT use any glue in case you need to swap out the Straploks in thefuture.",positive
"Very easy to install, rock solid, and in my opinion, look much better than Schaller locks.Grab a set, you wont be disappointed.",positive
"This product is a must.  Why?..... because it makes strap install and removal so simple and reliable,...and when the strap is clipped into place it is secure.  I've owned numerous Straplok systems on the various bass guitars I've owned, and would not ever own an instrument without installing this system.",positive
"I have two sets of these for my straps.  The push button action is most convenient vs. fighting stubborn leather openings, especially if new.  The gold finish matches my instrument's hardware and they are sturdy and durable.  Works for me!",positive
"It's worth a few extra dollars and a little extra time to install these. It sure beats fixing a cracked neck, headstock, or guitar body after a guitar slips off the strap pins and falls for a great height!",positive
"Oh Yeah, Love this item, sleek looking and very easy to maintain, would definitely buy again for next strap, thank you Jim Dunlop.",positive
"I have had these on a Les Paul for years and just purchased some more for the rest of my guitars.  Does what it says it will do - keeps your strap locked on.  I have had zero issues with these.  The installation takes 2 minutes, and has stood up to countless hours of play.  Highly recommended!",positive
"these dunlop straploks are amazing! never had them fail on me, and always gave me a good piece of mind knowing that my guitar is safe from hitting the floor on stage or at home, they stay secure when done properly, I've looked at other strap locks and tried some others but the dunlop ones just seem to work, and work well.",positive
Very high quality they look as nice as my Fender originals .  Make sure to take your time installing them correctly and consider using a quality wood glue / adhesive during installation.  You want to make sure they can be removed at a later date without damaging the guitar .,positive
"i've had these straplocks for a few years now and they haven't failed me once! i love them, and i never have to worry about my guitars getting damaged from a strap falling off or so. they rotate in full circles, and are super durable. you should buy them for all your guitars, and you'll never have to worry again. they are also very easy to use, and &#34;install&#34;.",positive
This is the first time I've used the Dunlop Straploks system.  I've always used the competition.  These work just as well.  I guess you just have to make sure you lube the little ball bearings once in a while.,positive
"What's great about the Dunlop design:They work!  The only thing you need to do is ensure you've got them engaged properly at the time you attach your strap onto your guitar i.e. just make sure you established a solid connection then go ahead and gig your rear-end off without worry.The design encorporates bearings that allow the strap to freely move around/rotate on the post, which is exactly what you want.  The schaller ones (see below) have a major flaw in them from my family's experience.  We will never run anything other than this design going forward.What doesn't work with the Schaller Design:Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist have been using Shaller-style locks for a while now.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend. The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.",positive
"I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops, and boy am I amazed!  Every straplock system I've used in the past, on friends' guitars, semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim.  In contrast, these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it's great!  Better still, the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes, making installation trivial.  And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch, using the posts like the OEM ones.  This is a great system, and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar.",positive
I use these on my basses and they do the job quite well.. They are easy to install on the bass and the strap.,positive
These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG. All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars. I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out. Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place. Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:1- Bulky. They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.For a few bucks more I'll stick with Schaller's. I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail.,positive
"I've been using the same Straploks on all my guitars for the past 10+ years.  I have not had one fail on me ever.  Just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure it's on right.  I've struggled with the C clip in the past, but what are you going to do?  It's a one time thing when you first install, so it's no biggie.",positive
"I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, here's what I recommend:Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1"" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesn't need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!",positive
"The very first thing I noticed about the design is how far from the guitar's surface the strap is actually connected.  What this tells me is there is considerable added stress to the screw and the wood surrounding it because of the added leverage to the guitar's weight.  The &#34;fulcrum&#34; is the surface of the wood, if this makes sense, and I can't help but wonder if it could eventually (eventually over much time and use) cause cracks or splits as a result.I found someone selling only the Dunlop strap buttons, which is a great idea for someone with 2 main straps and several guitars, and was about to order them when I found Planet Waves Elliptical End Pins.  I think this is the best idea yet for keeping a guitar on a strap, unless you're going to be spinning the guitar around your shoulders, and no additional stress on the guitar's body.  I've ordered a set.",positive
"Sorry, I don't like these as they're just too big. They stand out too much. They do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced. There are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap.  Again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant. I also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like I should be wearing big purple platforms when I play. Not cool.",positive
"Quick snap on and off. Sturdy.  If it is not convenient, it won't be used.  In this case, it is very convenient and easy to use, hence, your prized guitar will not drop to the floor by accident.  Well worth the money spent!",positive
"I agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy.  I purchased a set of these strap locks years ago, and I dont recall having this issue, so I'm thinking that Dunlop changed the screws at some point.  I was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle, and the locks are secure.  However, due to this issue, I'm considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks.  I hope Dunlop fixes this issue soon.",positive
"The Dunlop Dual Design Straplock System is a sturdy, fairly easy-to-assemble and easy-to-install alternative to guitar straps slipping off of instruments.  The screws that are used to attach the Straplok to the guitar are heavy gauge and pretty large--there's little chance that these are going to come out.  The locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance.  The only disadvantage of the Dunlop system to Schaller's system is that the the Dunlop sticks out measurably farther from the guitar's body.  Ordinarily, it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences.  On an instrument such as a Hofner ""violin"" bass, though, or any guitar with a strap button on the back of the instrument, this makes it difficult to hold the body of the instrument against your body for support.  Schaller's strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players.  The Dunlop Straplok System is sturdy, should provide a long life of service, and can be found at a better price than several of its competitors.  Recommended for most guitar body styles",positive
"Installed on two guitars and I love them! I can switch out many different guitar straps without worrying that they will fall off. Great product, would recommend to any guitar player!",positive
These are great.  I have these on all my guitars.  Only problem is the clip on install to the strap.  If you can't get it done google for install videos which will show you how to use a pliers to push the clip into place.  Once installed you are good for life.,positive
"I know this is a great product.  I've had a set before.  I have to knock off a star because a part was lost during shipping that renders the product useless.  The product comes in a clam shell package.  For me it shipped with some heavier stuff that impacted the package and let it open some.  There are two retaining clips that slipped out and since the main shipping box wasn't fully taped up one slipped completely out of the box and is probably on the floor of some warehouse or truck somewhere.  I found the rest of the small parts in the box and the larger parts still in the clam shell package but without the one retaining clip the system is useless.The product is too inexpensive to bother with a return.  If I find a retaining clip that will work (I do have one to compare with) then I can use it.That said, I'll say again, the Straplok System is a great product.  I know, I've owned another set for more than twenty years!",positive
"A little story to back these lock's integrity.  I installed them on a Korean made Washburn WG-587v.  Incredible guitar after tweaking.  I did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying.  The strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder.  The screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar!  The screw tore through about a half inch of solid wood (and I epoxy all my screws in) before the strap lock broke.  Amazing.Nice, tough hardware.  The only complaint I have is that you must use screws with small heads if you choose not to use the stock screws provided.  Easy to install, just unscrew your stock strap holder and screw in the lock holder.  Attach the lock to your strap and BAM quick release system.  Fast to take on and off of your guitar.I would suggest getting a tough, thick leather strap with a nice reinforced eye to install the quick release button in, cheap lightweight straps will eventually start to tear.  Also, the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps.I have now switched over to DiMarzio clip lock straps instead of the leather straps with Dunlop locks for many reasons and I am very happy, but this product is GRADE A! I always felt 100% secure with these straplocks.  Our bass player uses some expensive (and heavy) Fender basses and he loves these strap locks.",positive
"I've been using these straplocks for over 10 years now and never had a guitar or bass break free on me either live or in the studio...they simply work and cost next to nothing to boot. Folks, this is the best insurance you can buy for protecting you precious instrument from popping off of you strap, even if you do some serious gymnastics on stage it's not going anywhere. This is a must have, just buy it!",positive
"I'm in love with the dual design system! It works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly. There is one downside to this system, as the strap that is used will be fairly far away from the guitar itself. Which might not be a bad thing considering wear and tear on the guitar from the strap. There was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time. One component, which was this thin but big washer was pretty hard to install and the directions weren't much help either. The directions did have it on there where it is supposed to go, but I didn't know the name of the piece nor could I readily find it in there. After that, I installed this into my new guitar and strap and, I was ready to go. I HIGHLY recommend this! It is much easily to switch out straps w/o the possibility of striping the screws or boring into the screw hole and cracking some of the wood in the process.",positive
"I've been using these Fender straplocks over the last year:Fender 099 0818 300 F Straplock ChromeThe problem with those is that they use screws to secure that part that is on the strap itself, and the screw will slowly back itself out and you get yourself a disaster. I've decided to try these because they use a ""dual"" system: you can use the lock on your strap, or just use your ""regular"" strap without the locking mechanism. I've only been using these for a week, but so far, I like them much better than Fender's. I think I will replace all Fender straplocks with these.I do agree with the others on the fact that the screws are of lower quality, and the screw heads will strip if you're not careful. When I was installing these strap nuts, I screw in a half turn at a time, and applied lots of pressure so that the the head won't strip. If you can get over the installation, you got yourself a pretty good locking strap.",positive
"I have used Dunlop Straplocks for 32 years. I bought the original style years ago for my Strat, Les Paul and Partscaster; the last two having the most weight.These things have lasted through gigging and anything else i can throw at them with no problem. I ordered strap pins only a few months ago to put on a few more recent guitars and one of the push button locks finally went out. It was on the strap I used the most for the heavier guitars so I got some mileage out of that thing. I ordered a whole set of new ones here last month and put the locks on a new strap and the buttons on another guitar.I suggest these over the other brands - watch what touring bands use. These things lay flat and there are no protruding parts to catch. If you happen to be without a strap with locks on it, these new pins can be used like regular pins but are larger so a strap will be pretty much secure.The price is good, price them anywhere else and include shipping. I always buy strings, picks or other stuff to get free shipping.",positive
"Good Quality, great price, easy to install, easy to lock and unlock, fast delivery. Better than going to the always overpriced Guitar Center.",positive
I always purchase Grovers for my guitar straps but my 2014 Gibson Les Paul Standard Plus had a bigger strap knob so I bought this Dunlop and it fit the guitar perfectly. A good guitar is a big investment and you owe it to yourself to protect your investment with a good strap locking system.,positive
These are good if you have a few of guitars and got a favorite strap.  Buy alot of extra buttons i got allparts.  seems really sturdy and well made.,positive
"I went a long time convincing myself that I didn't need these.  I had numerous times when my strap would come undone - fortunately never during a performance.  These solved the problem.  I still check, but they just won't pull out or release.",positive
These guys are rock-solid and really easy to install. Any time I get a new instrument I change the stock buttons out for Dunlops!,positive
"I have these on my Jazz Bass, my guitar player has another brand. We were playing a HUGE downtown street gig in Altanta and were throwing T shirts to the crowd. Bending down, picking them up, then throwing. My guitar player had a different lock system, and his $1000 Les Paul fell to the stage, completely knocking it out of tune. Mine stayed locked perfectly...",positive
they work. its great not worrying about dropping your instrument on stage. ive done it  it sucked! worth every penny!,positive
Have them on four guitars. Never a malfunction. Easy installation and use. Watch out for bridge interference when screwing in the back lok. Might require a slightly shorter screw on some basses.,positive
"Work very well, nice low profile, easy push button on and off but, it is true, not good for thick straps. And the Gold Tone ones discolor easy with minimal use.",positive
"These are really great guitar locks!! I use them on all my guitars, and I would highly recommend them to anyone!!",positive
These work just like you want them to.  But a new strap and put these on right away.  It's worth it.,positive
i have purchased 5 of these strap locks. i would recommend them to all. they work good. very solid hold. thanks,positive
Again I feel line I work for Dunlop.....I don't just love the products .all my guitars and Basses have these locks,positive
I replaced the Schaller strap locks on my Strat with these. The Schaller ones ground on the connecting hardware to the point where I had to oil them a few times a month or I'd end up with an audible creak.Hands-down I like the Dunlop ones more. They installed in just a few minutes and the guitar feels very secure. No problems whatsoever. I just ordered my third set a few minutes ago.I'm a total convert - every new guitar I get is going to get a set of these put on it.,positive
"I put a pair of these on every guitar that I own.  I have a lot of extra strap clips around since I have many more guitars than straps, but these are great; they are all plenty tough, and if I find myself with my Straplok'd strap, it's nice that these work fine with a normal strap in a pinch.",positive
"Do as the manual says, lube them up every so often, and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button, and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes, and it works with most straps, as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box, it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however, as most straps are adjustable, so just adjust for the change in strap position, and you're golden!",positive
"About 4 years ago,  one of my friend dropped his bass and its body broke in half. that bass had regualr strap button, ever since then he use this dunlop straplok system. i recently built a bass myself and i install this one. it's very easy to install, very straight forward to use it. it holds my jazz bass without any problem. i would buy this from now on for all my electic guitars.",positive
"These are the ONLY straplocks I use, and I have them for ALL of my guitars.  They are the only ones I trust.  They are solid, secure, and they look great.  And the push button release makes them pretty convenient too, without sacrificing security.  Love 'em!!",positive
This the second set of strap locks that I've owned. They are a little difficult to attach to the strap if the thickness of the strap is a bit on the thicker side. The quick release and secure connection are great.,positive
"Dunlop is not the best strap lock system because it's a pain to switch which way the lock is pointing and people complain that the button is easy to unhook while playing. I can see the merits of screw on locks, what with the ease of switching the locks, but these work fine for me.",positive
"I hate spending 13 bucks on a couple little pieces of hardware that probably cost 13 cents to make, but its better than the 20 bucks local music shops want for this same set.  Overall they work really well and look sharp.  They fit perfectly on my Schecter Hellraiser.  Very happy with my purchase.",positive
"The Dunlop strap locks work pretty well, but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons.  The strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes.  This for all intents and purposes means that you will not be able to use that strap with standard strap buttons ever again.They do work as advertised and they are easy to take on and off for strap adjustment when required.",positive
"I play guitar and keyboard and, sometimes, I need to quickly put guitar on my back to play keyboards. I would not do that without this straplok.",positive
"The first thing I do when I get a new instrument, is put a straplok on it before gigging with it.They're easy to install, I haven't had one fail on me yet.I have straploks on nine instruments right now, and I just ordered another for my new bass...I can't recommend them highly enough!",positive
I&#8217;ve used strap locks before and never found any to be easy to attach or remove but these are well made and easy to use. Very secure. The best I&#8217;ve used so far.,positive
"I like this strap lock very strong very sturdy! Keeps things in place.. one problem.. The coating will wear out in a short time (a few months) and if you never take it off it might rust a bit on the inside. This might make it a bit hmm I don't want to say hard to lock, but you'd better make sure it is actually locked every time you fit it on by tugging on the thing to be sure, Mine has un-clipped a couple times because I didn't check. Our climate is humid so it's rust friendly which could contribute to why I'm having issues. However once clipped properly you shouldn't have issues! Great buy",positive
"Strings are half the battle with stringed instruments. A bad pair of strings on a nice instrument sound awful, and a good pair of strings can make a cheaper instrument sound tremendously better. Either way, stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point. These strings make my cheap ukulele sound not-so-cheap, and I imagine they would do even more wonders on a uke of a higher price point. I also play guitar and Martin is one of my choice brands for strings so I figured they wouldn't let me down when I decided to play the ukulele - I was correct.",positive
".I BOUGHT A UKULELE  TO GIVE AS A PRESENT.  I KNEW THE STRINGS THAT COME EQUIPPED  ON NEW MUSICAL STRINGED INSTRUMENTS WOULD BE OF POOR QUALITY SO I PURCHASED THESE MARTIN STRINGS AS A REPLACEMENT.  I'VE USED MARTIN INSTRUMENTS FOR MANY YEARS, AM FOND OF THE MAKE AND QUALITY OF THE MARTIN PRODUCTS.  THIS WAS AN EASY CHOICE FOR ME. THERE ARE OTHER EXCELLENT STRINGS AVAILABLE.  THIS JUST WAS MY CHOICE THIS TIME.",positive
"I've been playing the uke since before they became popular again and must confess I own a quiver full of the addictive things (ranging from plywood beaters to a solid wood art object with an electric in between). Over the years, I've tried several different brands of string. The truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them. It's just that the Martin M600 strings seem a little bit more compliant than the others and this allows me to tease out a bit more articulation and tone. Given that string changing is a frequent occurrence with multiple instruments to fuel, the Martin string set's relatively low cost is a nice bonus.",positive
"Great guitar companies don't always make (or sell under their aegis) the best strings. I love my Teles but I can't stand Fender strings. Likewise, I love my Martin ukulele, but trying these strings for the second time, I had the same conclusion as I did the first; Aquila's are far better. Aquila's have a more organic feel and a fuller, richer sound. The Martins begin to hold their tune sooner - Aquila's take a couple of days or more - but the sound is thinner and the feel isn't nearly as friendly. The approximately 3 dollar price difference is not, for me, worth the lesser satisfaction, even on my least expensive ukes. Considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings, the higher-priced Aquila's still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks. Use the Martin's (or any cheaper string) when you are working on your uke, put the stress of repeatedly de-tuning and re-tuning on them. Then switch to Aquila's for playing. Some may like the Martins but few won't love the Aquila's.",positive
"Great replacement string  for your ukulele, great to have on hand in case or replace your strings after you get your uku.",positive
"Works as it should. Nice materials and I think it will be durable. Simple to attach to your mic stand and adjust as needed. It will improve your recordings, getting the pops and sssss out of your sound without having to do sound processing as much anyway.",positive
"great easily setup but some time i feel its not perfectly stop the P's, i don't know why but some time i have to keep distance for that issue",positive
"What a difference a pop filter makes, I use on a condenser mic, it lets me get a little more gain input, clamps on easy and holds good, the flex piece holding the filter could be a little more rigid but does the job. I like the way it looks when mounted on the mic stand extension, It has improved the vocal tracks. Just one more affordable improvement for the home studio.",positive
"Great quality and construction. Does it's job well. Only complaint is that if the design were a little more streamline. These bolt on with attitude and are a bit heavy. Overall, stays in place and does it's job well. A workhorse for sure.",positive
"For the price, this is the perfect pop filter... really good length and the clamp is decent, hope it will last me awhile...",positive
"When I bought these I was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording.  Once these are in position they work just fine, the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks.  The device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it.  The filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where I wanted it and to keep it there.On the plus side, the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use.",positive
no complaints.  attaches firmly and does the job.  Can't beat it for the price.  Order this with eyes closed.  Great deal.,positive
It works as a pop filter should and is a huge upgrade over my make-shift panty hose pop filter. What else is there to say?,positive
"Pop filter works great. This really eliminated many subtle flaws I had with audio recording. Granted, you can make a make-shift pop filter using a hollow ring and nylon. But the adjustable clamp is really...well adjustable so fits many unique mic placement situations. Plus, although it is flexible, it is also very sturdy so don't worry about and vibration noises coming from this.",positive
filter works very well and looks professional. only problem i am having is that the clamp seems to work specifically with a mic stand or similar type structure.,positive
"This works fine, although the mount is a bit weird to me... but I see that most are the same.  As a pop filter it works perfectly and I was not able to hear any clarity loss or sound coloring.  Just pop filtering through black pantyhose !! lol",positive
"this little guy has help me record with my Apogee One voices and amps, to prevent air-flow shock on diaphragm... wanna have excellent recordings? get one!",positive
"Wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh? Some people pay for silver and expect gold ;)Okay, so I bought this because I do app review videos for a blog and my Blue Snowball mic was picking up the awful ""pop"" sounds that this is supposed to filter ""hard P, hard T, hard B, S, and a few others."" So I got this. Here are my pros and cons:Pros1. It works. I tested in Sony Vegas pro with and without the filter. The ""pop"" sound is completely removed with the filter. Which means it does what it was designed to do. 5-stars. It does not affect voice volume at all, just smooths those rough edges in your speech :D2. It looks nice. Attached to my Blue Snowball, it looks like a professional product. It doesn't really matter since I work from home and not in a public place, but it's nice to know I can show it to people and it ""looks nice""3. The clamp, bendable arm, and everything work appropriately. The clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface. So mounting this to, say, a desk probably won't be a stable as attached to a round thing, like the stem to a mic.4. I don't know why people think this ""isn't sturdy""...I mean you're not going to the local rink and playing hockey with the darn thing. The build quality is quite excellent considering that it's 2 fragile screens attached to plastic and metal.Cons1. It's pretty big. I used to shorten the stem on my Blue Snowball and stash it in a cubby hole in my hutch desk for easy storage. I can't do that anymore with this pop filter on it. Now it's become a permanent member of the front of my desk.Outside of this thing doubling the space my Snowball takes up, I have no complaints about this pop filter. It works well, it attaches nicely, it does what it is supposed to do, it looks nice, and the quality is good. This should be the last pop filter I have to buy for a long time.",positive
"Filter is of good size (6"") and easily comes apart for changing the fabric (I will probably use panty hose) if it gets torn. Other than that it works so what more can be said",positive
it keeps the spit off the mic and looks cool when recording - it does great at keeping you mouth off the mic so you dont breath it out and fits great on the stands with easy clamp,positive
"Yes, you can make your own pop filter at home, but you don't want to.  Why else would you be reading this?  Besides, it won't look this good.I've purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months.  The most recent one I purchased was NOT this one.  I wish it was.  I thought I'd try something different, just to see the differences.  Well, I can tell you that there are significant differences between this, and some of the others featured here.The bottom clamp on this one features a rubber piece that grips the metal pole that you attach to.  The competitors that I've tried do not.  If you do not have this rubber piece, any clamp will tend to slip down the pole and not grip properly.  This is a huge mistake as this makes using a pop filter on a boom stand impossible.  Fortunately, Nady placed this rubber piece on it's clamp so this has never been an issue.The only complaint I have is the screen has actually popped out of the plastic ring a couple times.  A single dot of superglue fixed that.Compared to the other pop filters I've seen and used, this one is perfectly suited for any microphone and at a reasonable price you can't beat it.And yes, pop filters ARE A MUST with condenser microphones.  Just buy one now, save yourself the trouble.",positive
"It does what it's supposed to do. It's as well made as most, I think. They all look cheap to me, unless you get a studio professional grade. The screen pops out easily, but it will pop back in. It works well for my home recording.",positive
"Peter Piper Picked A Pack of Purple Peppers - test passed, no &#34;puh&#34; sound to be found on the recording.",positive
"This is a decent pop filter. It gets the job done but it has a few flaws. It attracts a good amount of dust, the screen tends to mess up (which caused me to tear the first screen), & the goose neck tends to unwrap it's self out of place. It also gets shakey so I tend to have to screw it back in. Other than that, it's a decent pop filter but not for the price. Under $10 would've been better. I should have went with something cheaper than $20 *cough cough* the Auphonix pop filter *cough cough* but, I will in the future.",positive
"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then, I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost.",positive
"Though I'd warn if you don't know about audio this does not mean you can place your mic right in front of you and have the pop filter magically de-esse the whole thing, but between the pop filter and a slightly off-center placement it seems to keep the majority of erroneous pops and esses's from making an appearance in any way.",positive
"works very well, keeps the popping to a bare minimum, easy to install, cleans in a flash, lightweight and works",positive
"I do a lot of podcasts and dubbing over videos, and after using this filter, the pop that occurs with P's and B's in the voice are basically gone. It makes your audio more professional when you eliminate these annoyances.",positive
"When you record singing, you need this to prevent the pop sound. It is definitely worth it. It also makes you looks professional.",positive
"This pop-filter rocks. I like it a lot, does well compared to lots of other filters I tried. It's got a nice look too.",positive
"Use this for home recordings and some voice over recordings for work. I like the long neck on it and its a double filter so you get a tad bit extra. I tested it against my single filter and it did make a difference, as expected. It makes sense that if you have an additional layer there it will filter more effectively, but I wasnt sure if it would effect tone or highs, and I didnt notice either effected.",positive
This was a great investment for my home studio. I've been able to eliminate the majority of pops coming from my Condenser Microphone. I should of bought this a long time ago!!,positive
"I use it with an Audio Technica 2020, it work very well, the filter stays in place and it really improves the quality of the recording. Not much else to say.",positive
works well but wish it was a bit heavier and the construction was a little better made. but other than that works as intended.,positive
"I love this pop filter!  It is every to attactch and doesn't scratch the mic stand as some pop filter clamps do.  The adjustable arm is very flexible, yet sturdy to assure you of proper pop filter placement.",positive
"For the price, this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However, there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that, if I pick up the mic, the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once, but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works.",positive
Tested this on my Blue Yeti USB Microphone and could tell the difference with the POP filter on right away. Good investment.,positive
There too many required words to type for a product that doesn't need that much explanation.  It mounts to any mic stand and is formable to any position you need.  sturdy.,positive
"A needed accessory for any vocal recording, period. My only gripe about this model is why the straight bracket part needs to stick out so dang far, since you can bend the arm out in any position anyway.",positive
"Well thought out unit that does what it says it will, drop all that POP! I really like the way the clamp connector is rubberized to protect the finish of your mic stand. And being that it is rubberized, it allows you to adjust the filter to the mic without having to loosen everything up because rubber has an inherent &#34;give.&#34; And this is where the flexible arm allows you to fine tune the filters proximity to the singer, allowing you to do what you do best -- Sing! And then; and now for the really important part: everything stays where you last left it. Hell, even my cats can't do that, and they're porcelain.",positive
"Good solid construction. It hooks onto the mic stand and works as advertised, i.e removes the pops from vocal recordings.",positive
Very sturdy and awesome pop filter. Adjustable to any length you want and just a great pop filter! I would recommend this to anyone!,positive
This filter arrived very quickly! I use it with a Scarlett mic and it does exactly what a pop filter should. Good purchase.,positive
"These are high quality cables, both construction wise and in audio quality.  I use these shorter cables if I have to run bits of my rack to external amps/units, ie: unplugging and plugging in a lot, and I find these cables stand up to more abuse than the average cable.  I'm satisfied.",positive
Good Quality cable and price. Works as good as those expensive 99 dlls cables.It does not make any noise,positive
"Sometimes I have to run a longer cable to a snake if I'm doing the big band thing. Otherwise, I use this cable at every show. Love it.",positive
Looks vintage but works great at a great price. As good or better than my Monster cable for a lot less money!,positive
"This is my second Spectraflex cable and I love them. I love their flexibility, options for colors and ends, build quality and price. I like to use quality guitar cables for a good sound but I don't need to spend a fortune on them to be run over on stage by roadies or ripped off because the cable costs more than some guitars do.",positive
got this short cord to go from amp to waa! It works perfect for it I own a few Spectraflex cables and they are all fine,positive
"Rugged ends very flexible seem like this cable should hold up very well , does not tangle which is a real plus if you tend to move around a lot , connectors seem to be heavy duty , time will tell but I would assume that this cable should last a long time .",positive
"After suffering through crackles, lost signals, and all the rest, I decided to heed the numerous positive reviews of the Spectraflex tweed cable and purchase one through Amazon.com.  Because the new acoustic-electric classical I received as a gift has an end-pin outlet, I bought the Spectraflex with the right angle connector.  Although I have been using the cable for only a few weeks, I am very impressed.  The connections on all the guitars and basses on which I've used it are sure, with no loss of signal, no crackles.  Perhaps most impressive is the fact that I can turn the right angle connector around and never have any change of signal.  Finally, I can be confident that when I play, something will consistently come out of the amplifier.  By the way, the old-school tweed look is a plus, too.",positive
"Well, what can I say? Based on the customer reviews, this purchase seemed like a no-brainer. However, after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. The cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). And before you ask, &#34;is it perhaps your output jack?&#34;, all of my other cables work with my gee-tar. So it is definitely the cable :(Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120.",positive
"Spectraflex makes great cables. I bought this right angle 10' red cable for my older Ibanez guitar. This cable is built to be extremely durable, is made in the USA, and comes with a lifetime warrantee. The 20 gauge construction and rugged nylon braiding makes for a very low noise cable, and the connectors are very secure and feel quite substantial (especially compared to a cheaper Fender cable I had been using that required almost constant tightening.) Though Spectraflex cables are not the least expensive (nor the most expensive,) they are a great value and I am definitely a fan. I recommend this cable without reservations.",positive
"I purchased three of these (three different colors) to make a mini-snake for my keyboard to their Di's.  I typically used Mogami 2524/Neutrik, but need cakes while in the road (I usually roll my own to exact length).  These have worked well, quiet, no handling noise, seem well built (I treat cables well, so I don't really test them with under tough circumstances) and hopefully will remain in their spot for the foreseeable future.  They are used 6 nights a week, and after 50 uses, no problems.  I recommend them (plus, for live, the fabric cables in different colors are great for easily identifying which is which for a road crew member who might not know audio well.).  Nice pieces...",positive
"I keep this cable on my pedal board -Pedaltrain MINI With Soft Case. I've posted a photo on the pedaltrain Mini page. The right angle connector is great to exit the last pedal on the board and the straight connector goes into the amp. I use a Mogami silent cable -Mogami Platinum Guitar 12, Straight to Straight with Quiet Plug 12 feet- for the input to my guitar, but I can't justify paying a LOT more money for the side that goes to my amp (it's not getting bumped around, plugged and unplugged, etc.). This cable works perfect for it's purpose. Oh yeah... and it matches my tweed amp!!",positive
"This is a pretty strong cable. I wanted something I can plug into my top loaded amp and the jack would stand out in case I'm sitting on the amp. the angle does the job. seams strong , seams like it will last.",positive
I bought two to run from my amp to a lone pedal effect that I use with my bass.  The 90 degree ends go to the pedal and it makes for a non-intrusive smart looking setup.  I'm pleased.  I've owned them for a few months now.  No issues at all and they look good.,positive
"I'm a professional musician and love these cables, they look great and perform great and feel a lot tougher than the rubber covered cables I've been using",positive
This has become my number one cable for my Carvin bass. I gig with it a couple times per week and it has been rock solid. I only use something different if I need a longer reach. And I love the tweed cover. Very satisfied with this one.,positive
"I've had this little amplifier for a few weeks and I couldn't ask for a better practice amp. It's amazing how loud it gets in an otherwise quiet room, but it'll get drowned out pretty quickly when you add competing sounds. It's rugged and portable, and it's fun to play around with some of the effects. The fact that it runs on batteries is a huge plus.",positive
Might work well for recording too when you take the output jack.  Speaker is acceptable quality but can't be compared with a Fender amp as this one has 5 watts and a small speaker and the other has 10-20 watts.  I'm opting for the convenience of the size.  I got this after getting a couple smaller amps and headphone monitor plugs since it has both and was better sound with good effects.  I like the 'brit' setting.  I sound like a rock star with it.  Good product for practice or recording.  You could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig.  But for around the same price you could get a Fender amp.  This product works for me and the quality is pretty good.  Other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this.,positive
"There are several types of practice amps. High end modlers (Line 6, G Dec, Vox VT) that can still run $400+ and are typically overloaded with features. The low end tubes (Fender Blues Junior, Bug V22, Peavey Valveking, etc). These typically are more stripped down (in features, not neccessarily quality). And then there are the micros. I always thought they were just a notch above toys, the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from Wally World at Christmas.Boy was I wrong...I needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school. It was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear. He's not a big kid, so even 15lb. amps are pushing it(plus a gig bag and school back pack). That was initially what brought me to the Micro. Not sound or features, just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso. Turns out this is an AMAZING amp. The tone destroys the Line 6 and the features crush the Vox Pathfinder (6watt?) or Bug V12. And the Fender frontman - not even in the ballpark.Each of the models are distinct. The cleans are sparkly (more trebly) and the high gain models are very articulate. Obviously this isn't a loud amp, but that's not all bad. You can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes. It also can be battery powered (the life is suprisingly long), includes a regular wall plug, headphone jack, built in tuning fork (which is kind of lame) and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously. For example, I was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some Dick Dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy.Don't let the size fool you. I honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and I couldn't have been more wrong.  There are several big websites and it's tough to find any negatives about this amp. Quality sounding and durable for a great price.Oh - and the red - if you can find it - looks pretty sweet too.",positive
Great little amp. I had to take my Ampeg Jet in for a maintenance and I just love this little practice amp. I enjoy using it with both my Fender Strat and my Rickenbacker.,positive
"I bought this amp to replace a Squier SP-10 that came with my guitar.  The Squier had no effects, just a clean channel and an overdrive button.  I couldn't afford a bunch of pedals, but I wanted some effects so I could get cool sounds from my electric guitar.  I saw the reviews for this little amp on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It is Awesome!  For such a small amp, the output is plenty loud for practicing at home, and it runs on batteries, too, so I can take it anywhere.  The effects are better than I'd hoped for.  This is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer, but for an intermediate level guitarist (like me) who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family, this is the amp to get.  It has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus, flanger, phaser, or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay.  I'm one of the growing number of retirees who decided to pick up the guitar and learn more about it now that I have the time.  I don't need the deafening stacks that the kids like.  I love this amp.",positive
This pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries.  We've used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up.  We are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it.  We are using an mp3 player for backup.  The sound is not quite as clear as we get with our Roland Cm-30 (so only 4 stars from me).  The micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and it's nice not to have to load up cart to roll around.  Guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features.,positive
The MicroCube came with new AC Adaptor that supports 110V and 240V. Now I can take it along and use it in Europe/ Asia and USA.I saved $30 from buying another AC adapter that supports 240V.Happy Customer!,positive
"A good solid piece of equipment! It sounds as good as it looks and it is absolutely beautiful! The description listed slight wear marks on the back, but I had to really look hard to find it (one). It came as well packed as a brand-new guitar and looks like one!",positive
"Tone control didn't work so it was returned.  But it was pretty nice even though I felt the fret-board quality is higher on my 900 Gibson Les Paul but what can you expect.  If I had to order it again I would pay 140 more and get the SG 400 which has the quality pickups.  The sound is let's say... average.  Good beginner guitar, or a guitar that can be upgraded with new pickups.  The bolt-in neck didn't bother me but the SG 400 doesn't have that which is another reason I would step up next time.  Shape is ok.  Purely subjective.  I like the solid Les Paul shape now a little better since it's more conservative.  But the size is good and almost more comfortable than the Les Paul style.  Can't believe they can make a good guitar like this for only 160 bucks.  Also, even though I was tempted with the faded finish, the glossy finish is really nice.  This guitar will make a player proud.",positive
"For the money you can't find a better deal.  I am currently overseas and didn't want to bring my good guitar along.  This is a great playing guitar for the money, comes packaged extremely well and high quality all around for the price.",positive
"I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadn't.  The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes, but oh well. Now on to the guitar itself.....This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isn't a professional musician, I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics, mainly the switch could use some replacing.  I'm not complaining, I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169, you can't expect to have the top of the line.To sum it up, I love this guitar.  I keep in E flat tuning and it stays.  To me, a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop it's tuning a little.",positive
"i love this thing!!!  action is perfect,  great sound,  good feel, easy to play i highly recomend this",positive
At first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my Epiphone LP-100 Les Paul Electric Guitar,positive
Now-a-days I just search amazon because they have always got what I want at reasonable prices. This is no exception. I am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro to the guitar guy for setup etc. This was was better then I expected. It is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit. In other words great all around. I know it sits on a self with many other guitars when I take it in to the guitar guys so I am perfectly confident that it is well protected. and it is lockable (with key)If you are looking for a more then good case for your Epi LP just get this one. You will not be disappointed.Also. I ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day. No special shipping. Maybe it is my locations but that was great too. Well packed.,positive
"love the case nice and simple, it really look exactly the same as the picture. highly recommend to everyone looking for a case.",positive
"Bought this along with the guitar as a present for my daughter. The guitar fits in this case perfectly, and is very well protected.",positive
I ordered this for my Epi LP Special 2 and obviously it fits like a glove! Beautiful interior and a comfortable padded handle. Solid hinges and even comes with hinge lock on the center hinge.,positive
"Basically, this case is very sharp looking - made with good quality materials. The inside of the one I received was grey fur. The case would probably take a beating over time, but its not a SKB case. Nice enough that I wouldn't check it at the airport. Survived a trip in a moving van from Philly to Boston.Would definitely recommended if you need a case that your Les Paul fits very snugly and safely into.",positive
"This case it built really well, it has really nice plush interior... storage area for picks-strings-tuning fork-etc in the neck, it DOES have a lock on one of the latches. The case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got; so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it. Turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key... so dont worry. Just dont be an idiot like me and give it a good tug when you get it.Above all it fits my Epi LP perfectly... as it should! hehe.",positive
"Its a tight fitting case. I am a proud owner of aEpiphone Les Paul Custom Proand it fits as snug as can be. When I ordered the case I assumed it would be made for my guitar. It arrived double boxed and wrapped in plastic. I am sure I received a new case. Being perfectly  protected as it was, it hadn't a mark on it so.As far as the construction, it not a flight case by any means. It looks as though it will hold up to at least some abuse and still do its job, to protect the guitar. My guitar does not move in the case due to its perfect fit. With this said, over time there is a possibility of wear. I would predict the buckles may be the first to fail. And then handle doesn't look as durable as it could be , we'll see on that.Overall this is the case for the Epiphone Les Paul. I saw the Gibson case and I just don't see them as superior enough to justify paying more. I am satisfied with my purchase and I think most people would be. Five stars for now. I will edit in the future if necessary.",positive
Very nice case for the price.  Solid construction and perfect fit and protection for my Epiphone LP.  Would definately recommend.,positive
"Hello, I bought a Epiphone Goth Studio guitar and I also bought this beauty. I'm very satisfied with the quality of this case, as it makes my guitar looks very nice and very nice protected.",positive
"this case is the best i've ever had...very plush on the inside, and hard construction on outside is very strong...the handle extreamly soft to the touch...i guess all my other cases just don't measure up to this one...it even locks...if your guitar fits...but this for the quality!!!",positive
"The case is hard on the outside and soft on the inside as it should be. The pocket inside is nice for holding accessories. It does include a lock on the middle latch, but somehow mine eventually stopped working, as the lock isn't very good quality. The lock cylinder itself fell inside the lock and can no longer be used. Otherwise great case, highly recommended.",positive
"I use this for my Epiphone Zakk Wylde Custom Les Paul. It fits perfectly in the case, one of the best cases I own and have seen, the carpet is awesome, also has a pocket in the middle, what holds the neck up, and can fit a strap and even a pedal. Very durable case and seems like the younger brother of the more expensive Gibson case.",positive
"An affordable guitar case that fits my guitar perfectly. That's all there really is to say, if you need a sturdy guitar case  for a Les Paul styled guitar and don't want to spend a butt-load of money, look no further.",positive
I bought the bigger version of this for my Riviera P93 and this case is just as plush and protective- best deal going for a brand new case - I just wish they had these for more brands-,positive
"I do some guitar repair work and one of my customers needed a LP case. I have bought a lot of stuff here on AZ so looked at this one and had it shipped to him. He says its great so that is my review.Prices are always great on AZ and Prime saves me money in shipping.4 stars is my tops, anywhere.",positive
"I could not believe the quality of this case, fits my Epiphone Les Paul 100 like a glove.  Very plush interior, plenty of storage and very durable.",positive
I'm not much for brand names on my guitar cases. I figure it tells would-be thieves what they're getting!  I sprayed a little matte-black paint over the Epiphone logo. The case itself is quite sturdy and the inside is very plush. It fits my Line 6 JTV Variax in a very cozy way. Great case for small cash!,positive
"Ordered one of these Gig Bags for a new Les Paul - the hard shell cases are back-ordered, and I didn't want the guitar just sitting attracting dings and dust.Fits a LP Studio perfectly, has room for small items in an outer zippered pocket. Does the Job !",positive
"If you're looking for something to protect your guitar until you can afford a good hard case, this is it. For the price, it has better padding than I expected and is equipped with carrying handles and a shoulder strap with metal buckles and snaps. Good deal for the price!",positive
"As the title states, this is a lightly padded duffle bag, nothing more. If you're toating between practice with an instructor, it's okay. I purchased it for that reason...and I'm an adult, so I can be careful. This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. It will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it.There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price.",positive
"This bag is light, with two back pack straps, a pocket for accessories, excellent quality material and a good quality zipper.  If you just need something lightweight to protect your instrument this is it.",positive
"Good quality bag for my Epi LP. Fit like a glove, in fact I wish they were a little larger to hold some accessories.",positive
"At &lt;$20, this is a great bargain, but it is a very basic bag. It fits my Les Paul Standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying. These are also easily removed if they bother you. This Epiphone gigbag also has a zippered pocket for accessories (holds a strap, patch cord, but not much else) and features nice looking graphics.",positive
"Rugged, robust, flexible. Couldn't ask for more in a momentary switch. Like all Boss products it will probably last longer than me.",positive
"I got this for use with the Boss DD-20 as a tap-tempo. It does the job well, it's a little big for what it is, but definitely worth having with a delay pedal",positive
"I got this for my Boss Loop Station, but it doesn't work very well.  I keep hoping I'll find something it DOES work well with...",positive
No problem at all.Great quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand. Thak you very much!,positive
"I could not beat the price. The pedal does what is suppose to do on my Dynamic Wah guitar pedal. It is well build and I can use it on other Boss and Roland gear. Also, it not to big. It does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board. Very happy with this item.",positive

"Summary for those who don't want to read the whole thing: This is more than worth the money. If you're a beginner looking for a first guitar or if you're experienced and are searching for a backup/travel option or anything like that, get this. Do not hesitate. A cheap guitar doesn't ALWAYS mean a POS!Alright, full story/review:So, when I was a kid up until my early teens my (insanely talented and self-taught) older brother helped me learn how to play guitar. I got pretty decent but somewhere along the way I stopped and I've regretted it basically every day ever since then. Recently, I decided to stop internally griping about it and realized I should actually DO something about it. So, here I am.Having previously lived in a house with multiple guitarists, I have heard the sounds of expensive guitars and I have heard the sounds of the cheapest guitars (like a typical beginner's First Act). I knew there was a middle ground and I was determined to find it. I got way more than I bargained for.I began my quest knowing that my funds were limited. There was no way I could afford to dive right in and buy a high end, top of the line Fender or Martin like I had had the benefit of learning on back in the day. I knew I had to go cheap, at least for now. I began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars. After an exhaustive amount of research, I chose this one due to the positive reviews and because all of the demos I'd pulled up on YouTube were excellent. Plus, Epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general.Despite the positive reviews, I was still a bit leery; buying instruments without actually handling them first is always a bit of a gamble. Even if it sounds nice and plays well, sometimes a perfectly solid, functional instrument just doesn't FEEL right. As I went through the checkout I silently reminded myself that I could send it back for any reason. I went into this fully knowing that there was a good possibility I'd just have to bite the bullet and buy something better, even if costlier.Well, it arrived earlier this week and I am not disappointed. I certainly didn't expect perfection and I was convinced that I would find some kind of error, if only cosmetic, with such a cheap guitar. I am here to tell you that I have not found anything wrong with it. Even if I had (unless it drastically affected the sound/playability of the instrument), it would still be worth the price.Along with the guitar I bought some new strings (Martins) because 9/10 times the stock strings that come on instruments are awful. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable. I see that some of the other reviewers disagree. Maybe their strings were older or maybe it's just preference, I don't know. All I can say is that the stock strings on my guitar were not at all corroded/old. Shockingly enough, the guitar was pretty close to being in tune right out of the box! It doesn't seem to have any trouble staying in tune, either. All of that being said, it wouldn't hurt to pick up a pack of strings just to be safe. I mean, I'm sure that when I do finally put the Martins on I'll be even more mind-blown than I already am with the way it sounds.This guitar has a full, rich sound, plays comfortably (the low action helps!), and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets. Oh, and contrary to what other reviews have said - YES, it DOES have a truss rod. While we're talking about its positives, let's not ignore the fact that it's also super attractive with its shiny black finish. There isn't much about it that would give away its price. No, it's not a $1000 guitar but it certainly doesn't play like a $100 guitar either! I don't regret this purchase at all. Even in the future when I progress and upgrade I will definitely be keeping this lovely gem!If you're still unsure, do what I did and listen to some demos on YouTube. I doubt you'll be disappointed. (Pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the GearWire YouTube channel did. He clearly doesn't know what he's talking about and I, as well as everyone else in the comments section, was sure to express my feelings about that, haha! One user even claimed Epiphone should sue him!) Check out the video reviews by the users/companies GoldHat3, SamAshMusic, GigGear, and ShadowFW.My only complaint about this guitar is that I didn't buy it sooner!Good luck on your search, I hope this review has helped!",positive
"First off; let me start by saying I bought this guitar because it was only $100 and I was board on my deployment and wanted something to brush up on before I return home.I DID NOT: expect good quality, sound or comfortably from this guitar.I DID: want something cheap I could toss around and use out here in the desert without worrying about it getting beaten up or trashed.When I unboxed this guitar I was floored! The hardware is much higher quality than I had expected by far. The strings it came with weren't complete crap, but I swapped them out for my favorite set of strings: Ernie Ball 2406 Ernesto Palla Nylon Black and Silver Classical strings. The guitar sings beautifully; the tone is rich and vibrant.It's quite comfortable to play, I have no problems playing up to the 16th fret without this guitar having a cut away. I'm not a big fan of the pick guard that has the Epiphone 'E' on it, so I will probably end up removing it; but the sunburst is really nice looking. I have received many compliments on the look of it already.OVER ALL: this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag. GET IT!Also; I'm buying a hard case to take it home, or shipping this guitar back home to myself because I want to keep it as part of my collection. My original thought was to buy this guitar and leave it out here at the Rec tent for other people to use after I'm gone. Even if I do decide to leave it out here; I'll be buying another one when I get home!",positive
"This is NOT my first guitar. Nor am I breathless Epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of Taylors and Martins. It's not. Here's what it is: An exceedingly well-constucted, AMAZINGLY playable guitar. Fit, finish, feel and action were all VERY nice... Sound on the other hand? Let's face it. It's plywood all around. It SOUNDS like plywood. But that doesn't distract from the fact that it's a great guitar for $100 bucks.It's a fine &#34;first&#34; guitar. It's a great beach/camping/cabin guitar. Leave it in your car to practice at lunch. Leave it in the office. ANY guitar is better than no guitar... And this guitar is better than a LOT of other entry level guitars.Seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box... New, premium strings DO make a difference.If your expectations are for a playable, rugged, affordable guitar you won't be disappointed. If sound quality is your primary concern, well... You are going to have to spend more than a hundred bucks to be happy.For my desired application, this guitar was great... I'm very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat.",positive
It is my son's first guitar and he is learning on it well.  It is still in great condition. good quality Guitar!,positive
"this thing plays great!!  action is low but does not buzz, very easy to chord.i highly recomend this guitar.",positive
"Well constructed with quality woods, saddle/nut and bracing. Neck and frets are straight, level and do not snag. This guitar rings like a bell, stays in tune and is light weight. Do not let the low price fool you but do not expect the guitar to come set up to your tastes. Any guitar that you buy will need to be adjusted to your style of play. The strings may be too high or too light or whatever, just be ready to do a tiny bit of work to get it like you want it then it will serve you well. Do not buy a Luna, Davidson, Main Street, or any other 'no name' - get this one.",positive
"I normally use nylon picks but do some songs with flatpicking intros and the nylons were to flappy. These picks keep a nice bright tone, very little friction on the strings - so low string noise. Enough grip to stay put in hands well too.",positive
"I've been buying Dunlop pick for at least 15 years now, and I love the feel and the grip. The picks last for a really long time, and I would recommend getting several thickness' for different applications. But for sitting in a room playing around, with my acoustics and electric guitars this is a decent all round pick",positive
I tried this but ended up going back to Tortex.  I like the satin finish on the Tortex better and the way it bends.  The Ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly.  Ultex sounds more like the Fender celluloid.,positive
Sounds great. I own 5 different gauges. I like the gripping surface. .90 is my favorite gauge and the rounded tip is super fast.,positive
Guitar picks make a huge part of your tone.  Especially on acoustic.  These are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion.  They have a long life and do brighten your tone.  Freshening up the picks is easy just by rubbing them on your carpet or  carpet scrap to bring back the original shape.,positive
"These are nice, I like the 1.14 rigidity and these are just fine for me... you will wear them out on acoustics though if you are a more aggressive player as I am.  Once these are worn, as with most picks, they sound considerably different.  Much more grainy and tin-y but that may be a plus for you?  I also like the side edges for a real mellow and / or speeding picking style.  They stay in your fingers well.",positive
The grip is excellent. But I prefer the 1.14 Sharps over these. These are sturdy and look like I won't be needing another set for quite some time,positive
I bought the wrong gauge. I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. I bought the .90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them. These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound. I don't know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them. Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.Buy em!!!!,positive
I love the pick attack with these.  I have used almost everything out there over 20 years of playing and have settled on this pick as my go-to choice for acoustic guitar.,positive
"Didn't think I'd be compelled to review something like a guitar pick, but the Dunlop Ultex has really impressed me thus far.  I use the .60 thickness, which is equivalent to the orange plastic Dunlop pick.  The orange pick is my favorite for acoustic and most electric playing, but they do wear down and fray on the edges, and have a little more friction that I'd like.This Ultex seems very resistant to wear and has surprisingly little drag over the string.  I find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold.  It gives just enough to use for smooth strumming, while being rigid enough for individual notes.Some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use.  If that turns out to be a problem, I might reconsider my review.  But out of the box, they perform as well as any pick I have used!",positive
"Grabbed these on impulse as I needed some new ones. Normally I used the old Fender Medium or Heavy picks, but I gotta say these are great. Stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely. Not sure what could be said to prove it, but they just feel great.",positive
"I've used the Tortex picks for a while now, and have been really happy with them. This pick however, takes it to the next level. Very strong and great bite for a relatively thin pick. I use the .73 for acoustic and the same holds true. Great product.",positive
"This polish was recommended in one of Dan Erlewine's books and it works great.  It really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop.  The effect isn't as noticeable on darker finishes though.  It really helps on the back of the neck too, makes it slippery and fast.  Highly recommended.",positive
"I got this to clean my Washburn acoustic guitar, and it worked great. I used it to clean off the fingerprints and grime, and then would buff in a circular motion with my soft, lint-free rag, and it would act like a polish. The finish sparkled afterwards, even in the light. Great product.",positive
"Ive been using this polish since the early 80's. It doesn't smell the way some do and works fantastic on all of my guitars. Wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars. What has hurt my guitars is me dropping them or sweating all over them, but this polish? No way. Martin knows what they're doing. I use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes.",positive
"Used it once, but once was enough. Had been using Gibson Polish, although it worked fine, just couldn't force myself to use it on my Martin Veterans Model Guitar.",positive
This product is excellent.  Cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue.  Made my little Martin look almost as good as new.,positive
"this is the one that everyone told me I should use, being new to guitar I figured one polish (car) has to work well, that was very incorrect on my part, this is for the delicate woods and preserves them far better than ordinary polishes",positive
I bought this for my son to clean his guitar with. He really likes it a lot. It works very well if you use it with a microfiber cloth. I would buy this product again!,positive
"put it in my Fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well...  Love it to death, had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility.  the built in volume knob it a GREAT tough.  I could go on, but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better Job than here.",positive
"I like the fact that it can be &#34;partially&#34; installed with the cord coming out of the sound hole or it can be easily installed on a more permanent basis by cutting the cord to length and running it inside the guitar body through the end pin hole (which will have to be enlarged a bit).  Either way, once plugged in, it sounds great.  This pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar, a Blueridge BR-160.  I installed some Fishman &#34;under the saddle&#34; pickups in a few Martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good, if not better.  If you don't mind the pickup visible in the sound hole, this is the way to go.  Another nice thing about it is the ease of changing out the batteries as compared to the undersaddle type pickups where the batteries are attached to the inside body of the guitar.",positive
"This is not a bad product, just not great.  As soon as I received it, I installed it on my custom made Grit Laskin Guitar, and played with it for over two hours.  Installation was fast, and only took a couple of minutes.  My problems with it are 3 fold:  #1.  Sounds just a bit ""tinny"" = too much on the high end, and not an equal amount of bass.  #2.  A small complaint is that you have to dismantle the entire installation just to change the batteries, and I couldn't get mine to work in ""passive"" mode.  #3.  And the biggest complaint, is that the volume control is difficult to get to when you're performing on stage.  You have to stick your finger in the hole on the top side of the strings and fumble around trying to change the volume which is very sensitive so all of sudden you can be too loud or too soft.  Like I said, it is not a bad product, just not top notch, and definitely not for professionals.  If you're just fooling around at home, or recording at home, it is fine, and will do the job for you.  BUT!!!  If you're a pro, you'll want to spend double the money and get an L. R. Baggs M-80.  The M-80 gives you the truest sound (unbelievable), works in passive mode, and is very easy to change the volume control.  Sincerely, Doc",positive
"Great pickup, combined with the Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I. you will have an excellent experience.  Even the pick up by itself into a quality amp will make you happy.",positive
I was looking for a sound hole pickup and this came as one of the best and found it to be all I expected. I use it for practice and recording myself. I really like it but for the price I wish it had just a bit more otherwise its perfect. I have it on my 1994 Martin D-18  which has a big bottom end and no matter what it always sounds fine. I have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good.,positive
What can I say? These are probably the most well-known pads available and probably the best. This was the best price I could find on Amazon and they arrived as described via very prompt shipping.,positive
"Ok, so I just installed these things for my KRK 6's (no stands...just sitting on two other speakers).  What can I say?  The bass, which previously had disappeared in my studio, is now present again!  My monitors sounded kinda thin before because I was losing so much energy to my desk, but these things have made a ton of difference!  My stereo image even feels wider now!Sure, they're a little pricy, but hey...THEY WORK!  If that's what they want to charge for them, and people continue to buy them, I'm cool with that!  I'm happy with the reults my $40 got me!5/5!",positive
"These really do work great. No more desk vibrations and the sound out of my monitors are very clear now. I do only wish i could of found these in a smaller size since they are way bigger then my 5"" monitors. If anyone knows where to get smaller ones let me know. Thanks!",positive
"These MoPads are pretty amazing. I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these pads.These pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment. Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk. I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors. At $40, you can't go wrong with these pads for you studio. It is a MUST to have these.",positive
These are laser cut pads for your studio monitors. I feel more vibration from a hard drive spinning on my desktop than the sounds coming out of my speakers. And they look professional too.,positive
"Just what I needed for my Home Studio Monitors that sit on the table next to my Computer and my DAW system, was surprised at how many different versions I was sent, they all work well thanks heaps......",positive
"The reviewer who wrote that that these are ""cheap foam"" worth $5.00, doesn't understand or appreciate the quality of these speaker isolators. A/B these with some $5.00 cheap foam and you will realize how good these Auralex isolators work. I am using a pair of Behringer Truth active speakers that weigh 33 pounds each. These isolators not only support them very well but solved a big problem I had. It seems my speakers were ""audio coupling"" with the console they were placed on making the console vibrate with the spaekers and muddy up the lower fequencies.My problem started when I noticed that my mixes sounded good on other systems except for the bass frequencies around 80-125 HZ. Apparently my Behringer speakers were not accurately reproducing that fequency range and I was EQing that range badly to compensate. I didn't hear it when I mixed my Hafler M-1 speakers. I was about to give up on the Behringer Truth speakers but I really thought that they sounded excellent on every other frequency and are very detailed in every other range. The Behringers also had all the power I needed (active speakers) and can be played really loud in my studio without any distortion. Except for what I can only describe as a muddy or not clearly detailed low end, I love these speakers. Fortunately I was at a friends studio (a great pro studio) and I saw that he was using the Auralex Isolators under his speakers. He said he loved them. I bought them and placed them under my speakers and remixed a project I had been working on. WOW!! What a difference. It was an immediate difference. The bass is now nicely detailed and that muddy tone is no longer there. I had to reajust the EQ on the lower frequencies (cut them back to almost flat)on the new mix. I immediately bought a 2nd set for my small Hafler speakers. Why take a chance that they were also not reproducing accurately. These isolators are a great product and problem solver that saved me from buying new speakers and discovering that I still had the same problem. ""Cheap foam""?? I don't think so.",positive
"Some will argue that these are not necessary for your monitors, however as somebody who has worked in music for more than half their life, I can assure you that, whereas they're not life or death, they do make a significant improvement on the listening process, especially in your project studio. No, they're not going to make your music sound any better, but they will give you a more detailed and accurate bass response when your monitoring. Even cooler is the fact that the pads come with 2 extra pieces of padding that will essentially let you customize the position of the monitors in that you can angle them up or down ever-so-slightly. Lastly, although my monitors fit perfectly on the pads, I can't help but to think that if my monitors were any larger, I would need a second pair, especially if they were positioned horizontally. All and all, overpriced or not; they really make a world of difference.",positive
"These strings are very bright and full.  They sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead.  I haven't had any problems with breakage, just a loss of tone over time (seems faster than some other strings I've tried).",positive
"As a guitarist who's had the opportunity to work at Guitar Center (back in 1999), trying each type of string on the market was a fairly inexpensive and easy task.  While I'll chose D'Addario EXL's for electric, Martin SP are my top choice for acoustic.  The sound and reliability are unmatched for the money.  They also have a neat bronze shimmer to them...  Granted that's only aesthetic.",positive
Ive been trying different strings for years!!!  Ive been stuck on elixirs for some time now and wanted a change.  These are very bright and clean!!!!  very playable!!!,positive
"I have tried different brands and weights of strings in search of the ones that would give my guitar a clear, bright, yet robust sound, and I found that in the Martin MSP 4050 SP strings. I knew I had found, &#34;my strings&#34; after a short time playing with these. They are light on the fingers, sound great, and priced right.",positive
"Martin makes a variety of good sounding strings, and these are toward the light end.  The sound is bright, but lacks a fullness found with some of the heavier strings such asMartin MSP4150 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Light-Medium.The custom light are easier to play and have a bright tone to them, but can make a guitar sound like a cheaper model compared to the Light-Medium. Some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics. If you strum harder, they are more stretchy and the tuning will be less consistent, changing the tone for the same reason a ""bend"" would. If you play at a fairly consistent sound level you can expect more of a bright sound than a resonant one.On the other hand, compared to some other brands with more of a dampened sound, the brightness can make an instrument sound quite good.Depending on your style, these might be a good choice. If you are used to playing a solid body electric with a lighter feel to the strings that make medium strings uncomfortable, these might seem more at home.  If you are used to Martin medium strings, but want something that you can play for a few extra hours a day without feeling as if you are overdoing things, you might like these too, but when you pick up a guitar with the Martin Medium strings, you may find that even a cheaper guitar sounds better in comparison to these on a more upscale one.I wouldn't say I dislike these, and I wouldn't quite say that those who gave it five stars oversold them, because they may deserve five stars for your particular needs. But as an all around choice, there are better sounding ones from Martin. But it's a moot point if you don't feel comfortable playing them. Make sure to read a variety of reviews before deciding because there are other equally valid viewpoints just as each player is unique.",positive
"I bought these to put on my really old Martin acoustic. The guitar still sounds amazing, and these strings certainly fit my budget, and provide a great sound.",positive
These are one of the best strings I've used. I'm a blues guitarist so they take a beating well. Very much worth the cost and I thank Amazon for having them!,positive
"These are good strings, for a good price.  I have purchased these strings several times and they sound good and last a long time.",positive
"These strings retain a good feeling for a long time, well past the point of them needing changed because they've lost brightness.",positive
But these seemed to work well on the guitar I was re-stringing. My son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit more.Recommend.,positive
I bought these a while ago but just got around to using them last week. I don't ever remember the non wound strings being bronze but these are. To me it looks weird but they sound so much better than my ancient strings that were on there.,positive
"Brand name, good string, good tone, seem to last awhile but I change strings often so never really know how long a set will last.",positive
"I used to use Elixir Nano string, and a good as they sound, they do not last. These do. great sounding strings.",positive
"I've used these strings on all my acoustics and even gave some to a band mate.  They seem to keep their tone for a long time and don't change the instrument tone like some strings I've tried.  Like a lot of folks, I'm not that picky about my strings, but for those who are, this is a good light string that will sound great on your acoustic.",positive
"These strings are great sounding, and great looking on the fretboard, because they are bronze. One issue I had, was the 5th and 6th strings were too big to route more than once through the tuning head, but it still wound up very nicely. I would actually say that you might want to get the Extra Light gauge, but it's probably just my tuning machines, they kind of suck.",positive
These are the best acoustic money can buy in my opinion. They play extremely well and last a Long time. There's nothing better than these strings.,positive
I have a 1993 Taylor which is in mint condition. I always use Martin on any acoustic. I bought the Taylor about 6 months ago and have found that the Medium Martin Strings are best for this particular guitar ... every acoustic is different though.,positive
"Fast shipping, great price and most of all great stings, very satisfied would buy these strings again and would recommend to a friend.",positive
"Long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out, I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position, WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...Bottom line, I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string.",positive
If your not sure what to buy you are prob looking for the light strings. These are a littl ehard to play.,positive
I really like the mediums.  They are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being to heavy or not durable enough.,positive
"The Martin MSP4200 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Medium  are very good strings that are just below strings like Elixer's except they are much much less expensive.",positive
"With a nice clean, crisp sound, inexpensive price, and durable history, I've made these strings apart of my acoustic set. I've got at least 6 spares at home right now. XD",positive
I am not a connoisseur but nothing great about these strings.  They have pretty good sound but they seem to die quickly.,positive
I've used these strings for quite a while now. They have a fantactic tonal quality and longevity. If you're looking for a good string that last a fair amount of time before dead string syndrome hits... I'd recommend these.,positive
They sent me the 1mm (Blue) by mistake but it turns out I prefer that size after testing it out.  Fast shipping.  I play bass rock/metal,positive
These are nice and sturdy picks.They sound real clean.I'm having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings.I still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics.,positive
"I used to swear by Hard and stiff picks on my Les Paul Custom, but I recently bought a Strat '62 re-issue--and these are TOO MUCCH FUN for fast rhythms with a WAH or Phase 90 (phaser) pedals!!!",positive
"Just the perfect pick I was looking for, I've tried experimenting with several types of picks. Finally found the right one!",positive
arrived on time..packaged well. happy with purchase...they are your regular picks..will order again if needed. happy with purchase. hope you enjoy em...,positive
"I have tried few picks, textured, mallow color, and this bright green.  I like it bright color that is very easy to found, and 0.88mm seems right for me to strumming on an acoustic guitar.",positive
"I've used everything you can think of in the way of picks and the Tortex are one of my favorites. I have at least 100 of them in various thickness' and these and the Claytons, are all I need. The Claytons are great too, but there are times that I want a different thichness and with the Tortex and Claytons you can find the perfect pick for anything you want to play. They last forever and have a great grip.You gotta try them out",positive
"I bought the .73 mm picks & I would consider them medium thickness. If you like lighter get the smaller thickness or if you like heavy go for the larger thickness. The .73 mm is right for me, I really like them.",positive
Love these picks. Have used them for years. Feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever. Highly recommend.,positive
"I've always used Planet Waves nails but I wanted to try the Dunlop buying me this little package. A very good experience. Durable, comfortable and of a texture that makes it easy to use and does not allow them to slip easily.",positive
I know that pick choosing is a personal matter. I choose this specific model because the thickness and flexibility are perfect for me.,positive
"I use Dunlop Orange because the thickness is perfect. I hit the strings very, very hard and these picks are heavy enough to get the job done yet I don't break many strings.",positive
"i've been using these tortex picks for a few years now and won't buy any others.  they feel great, don't fall out of my hands, and have a decent life span (plus the turtle logo is sweet)",positive
Great picks for beginners and pros alike! Go for these thinner picks if you like more versatility in your playing.,positive
"I think Tortex / Delrin picks are the standard that others are judged by.Durable, good to gripping surface, easy to identify thicknesses by color.The only way I can think of to improve these would be to replace the black ink logo and script with some sort of raised embossing.Then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better.Take a look at ""Cactus Picks"" to get an idea of what I mean.",positive
"I've been a huge fan of dunlop picks for a long time. I started playing 15 years ago, and used the slim, floppy picks for a long time. As time went on and my guitar skills grew, I needed a pick that was sturdy, and wouldn't flex to play more intricate and detailed songs.The tortex purples are my favorite, and they're the thickest ones I can find. I like the soft sandy feel of these. They don't slip out of your hand easily, and because they're so thick, they take a long time to wear out.",positive
I like the picks a lot! They are super strong and look like can take a lot of use in a good shape! Recommended,positive
"Yes.  The 1.0mm Tortex picks are BLUE!  I was quite surprised at the number of reviewers that complained for not getting a multi-color pack.  If anyone has ever been to ANY guitar shop, the Tortex Picks are all color coded!Anyway, I've been playing guitar for about 15 years.  I've been using the Blue Tortex picks for about 14.  At first I messed around with all the different picks I could get my hands on.  Teardrops were too small; Fender brand were too slippery; Guitar Center brand wore out too quickly; the Jim Dunlop nylon picks just felt too weird to me.  The 1.0mm Tortex give just the right sound on the attack, don't feel too flimsy in my fingers (I keep a tight grip) and the grip on them is far superior to any on the market (gator grips feel too porous for me.)  Durability wise, I'll lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out!",positive
"Whatever size you are looking for Dunlop is the best option. It lasts long, sounds great, and feels very nice. It is probably the most favored pick among all companies. I recommend the orange one for beginners, and in general would not go much higher than the green ones because when it gets too heavy it does not feel to comfortable anymore and does not sound as well, but it is totally up to what you want. Either way, Dunlop is the best and for a great price.",positive
"I've always used these dunlop picks, I've tried other ones like fender, other dunlop picks as well but these just feel right, I've never like the thicker picks or the picks with the weird grips on them these just feel right when playing, give them a try! ... if not you'll just wind up with a cool little turtle tortex sticker instead",positive
"thankfully i still have most of these picks. i'm always losing them, but they work super well and i will always buy this brand from now on.",positive
I was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great.  They have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great.  It's almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these.  It sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers...you don't want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition.,positive
"I've been using these picks for 10+ years, they've always been great.  Between these blues and the yellow, I'm covered.",positive
"I love these picks.  The flex is just right for me, and they last forever.  I have never had one break.",positive
"If you don't know what type of pick you like, buy a sample pack. Picks make a big difference to sound and playability. These are thin and flexible. Easier to use for beginners and easier for strumming in general. However the tone is different. So you'll need to decide what songs they work for, etc.As far as quality, these are great. Easy to grip, and as durable as most.",positive
"Good picks, great feel and brings out sound loudly. Mostly for Electrics. I prefer the lighter sound of the Acoustic but these work very well with my friends Electric, Fender.",positive
"I used to use a lot thinner pick until reading an article from Paul Gilbert saying that in order to play fast you need a minimum of 1mm. These things are great and yes, I can shred faster now!",positive
"Finally decided in getting the 1.00mm picks because I don't like them too thin or too thick, this was the perfect gauge I was looking and hoping for. The logo will wear out in a few uses but I don't much about that. Been using it on a daily basis to practice and so far it's not wearing out too fast. Recommended!",positive
I think these are great for the price they give you. John Mayer uses these picks and hes one of my favorite guitarist so I am sticking with these.,positive
I've used these picks for years with great results. If you've never used this stile picks you won't be sorry.,positive
"In a fit of boredom or curiosity, I decided that I would check out some the other picks out there.  After spending too much money for various brands of picks, including every model of the DAVA picks, I came back home to Dunlop Tortex green.  They stil play great, sound great against steel strings, and last a long time.",positive
"These will pluck Guitar and Bass strings decently. If you want one set to cover both applications, this is a good choice.",positive
I like it.  Grip is good and the thickness is just right for me.  I wish the tip was sharper but it is good as is,positive
Tortex is great i really like their picks there may be better but these have fit the bill i prefer the yellow ones they are a little thinner,positive
"The thickness of the pick you use is a matter of personal preference. For my style, the .60 Dunlop Tortex is perfect.  The surface is matte and not too slick.  I don't think I have ever worn one down to being unusable; they seem to last forever (or until they're lost).  I've tried other brands and picks made of other materials, but I always come back to these. I'll probably be buried with one in my hand!",positive
i ordered one pack of these and got an entire box!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! either way the picks are great although i would suggest the Jazz picks over these,positive
"I always keep a lot of these on hand.  These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars (strumming style & vocals).  Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks.  These definitely last longer for me than other brands (similar weight) that I have used.  For example, I can &#34;round-off&#34; the end off a Musician's Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks.  The weight is great for my style of playing.  They seem more durable than other brands.  They're inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand.  I love 'em, use them daily, and rely on them !!!",positive
"I love the Tortex .50mm picks (red).  I have one that's over 4 years old and still going strong!  Yes, the turtle and writing eventually get rubbed off, but they never leave black residue on the pick or the strings.  I use the red, yellow, and orange Tortex's exclusively for practice and performance (I'm a church worship leader).  My highest recommendation.",positive
"I love these picks for playing my acoustic. They give such a nice, crisp tone and the perfect amount of flex for playing acoustic. For me I prefer a slightly thicker pick for playing electric, probably a .70 or .80 but I still like the tortex picks for that as well. And these picks are inexpensive enough that you can keep an endless supply.",positive
"These guitar picks are just the best. Simply put. They are easy to grip onto, even when your hands are sweaty from rocking out all day. Highly recommended. I will never use any other guitar pick other than a Dunlop Tortex. I use the green 88mm picks, and also the orange 60mm ones. I recommend you buy both the green picks and orange picks. Great for beginners or the pros.",positive
"I enjoyed this set very much due to the variety of picks, as it was interesting to try different models. Dunlop picks are great!",positive
"As a kid I learned to play the trombone proficiently, but my heart wasn't really in it, so I took up the guitar, which I love. I played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time. I recently started playing again and was looking for the perfect pick for classic rock (I have an old Ibanez and a Les Paul Custom) and have tried several picks in that quest. There are several I have liked (and several that I haven't) but thus far my favorite is the 1.0mm Tortex (blue) picks. They have a very nice, almost powdery, matte feel that minimizes slippage and they just don't break, though the 1.0s are fairly stiff. Depending on what you are playing there are various thicknesses available, and most people will find something suitable for their personal preferences. I won't say that I will never try anything else, but thus far I find myself picking up my 1.0 Tortex more than other picks.",positive
i've used pick when i play most of time and i used white color thinnest one. i like to use thin ones because i play strumming most of time and this one works perfect. very easy to grip and last long. one thing to point out is that print on pick fades away very quickly but i do not mind. highly recommand this for anyone needs pick!,positive
"These are such comfortable picks... I love the texture on them, which makes them easy to hold without being distractingly aggressive like some of the other picks' textures. This is subtle yet effective. My favorite pick now.",positive
"They feel very nice with a soft touch finish on them. Fair priced and I love the color of the green ones. I like the .88 mm because its just the right mix of medium and hard; great for someone looking to play blues or rock. Cheap and easy to use, can't beat these picks!",positive
"Great picks, buy it. This pick, rocks for me, im a fan of dunlop for many years and all there products are amazing.",positive
"I have always used tortex picks. I like them a lot and they last forever (almost :)these were a little thick for my tastes. The red ones are a little thinner and give better action for strumming and also for fast alternate picking patterns.If you like a medium thick pick though, these are rockin.",positive
"This is the pick I learned to play with.Great feel, doesn't slip in sweaty fingers.Good tone, you can get plenty of use from one pick, as they hold up very well!",positive
good deal.,positive
"I have been using Dunlop picks for a long time. Good feel, grip and not too heavy or thick. Good deal.",positive
"I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less ""clicky"" - than a standard plastic pick.  My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these.  I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same, I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point, so I use them more.  But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent.  They're almost impossible to drop, they sound and feel just right to me, and they last seemingly forever.  Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks.",positive
I can't hear the sounds of the strings over the flick of these flimsy picks across them. better for electric guitar but still hard to play fast,positive
"Ever since I started playing the guitar, I've used the nylon Dunlop picks. They're better in a thicker size (1.0mm or larger) but the .73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular Fender pick. They're flexible and easy to pick with, but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will NOT break. You'd almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it -- so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears.Also of note: the price keeps going up on these here on Amazon for some reason -- don't pay more than $3-4 for a pack of them, as you can get them at your local music store for about that.",positive
"I bought these because I wanted durable, flexible picks for easy strumming. I would recomend these to anyone that needs more stable strumming.",positive
"I like thin picks myself, and this one is VERY thin. You won'tuse it all the time, but every now and then it can be used in the right situation. If you are a player who is somewhat meat-fisted when it comes to playing and needs to take the edge off, it is ideal. Also, if you are doing very soft strumming on an acoustic guitar, it is awesome. No power chords with this little guy, but it is a good tool to have in the tool box when you need it. The non-slippery texture and it's grippy textured surface of Dunlops is what I love about them the most, it makes them easier to hold on to. I give them a thumbs up!",positive
"They're just great.  Awesome for chord based songs.  If you need to pick individual notes/strings, then you might want to go a bit thicker.  With that said, you can do it with these, but the tone is not as nice (sounds a bit softer).",positive
I am a bass player so I like my picks to be a bit thicker and wider. I tend to Play with Fender 346 so I was pleasantly surprised when I found that this pick worked really well for me.,positive
"I would give these picks five stars, but I do have a couple of other types I prefer more.  Still, these are nice picks.  So far I've only used them on 12-string guitar, but I'll soon be trying them out on 6-string guitars.",positive
"They're very thin nylon picks. They're good for practicing the hand motions of strumming; they put up very little resistance, so they train you to keep your hand stable. I still sometimes play with them since they give a really nice bright tone, but I usually want something thicker in order to be able to flatpick melody lines in between strums. I also sometimes use them when practicing flatpicking, since flatpicking with a really thin pick reveals things about your body mechanics that you don't notice with a thicker pick.They're great for what they are (thin, flexible picks), and Amazon has the best price.",positive
"These just don't have the right feel and the sound isn't that great compared to other materials.The quality control is so so. The picks aren't cleanly cut out they are injection molded and as a result they are left with a thin trim all around them.I'll stick with Dunlop Gator Grip .96mm or PRS 1.0 picks. For more flexibility or acoustic, I prefer Fender Medium Celluloid picks.",positive
"These have been my favorite picks, for decades now. They grip very well, and last forever, and they're a tiny bit more muted than other, more &#34;plasticky&#34; picks.",positive
"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career.  I rock hard. Acoustic, electric, and Bass!  I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily.  Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break, and once you find the thickness that fits your needs, you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career.  Buy these picks.",positive
"Im not loyal to brands on the whole but when I reach for a pick I hope this is the one I get. They wear out and get nicks so I have to remember to keep ordering them.Edit: Watch the Steve Vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn, nicked, picks. Rapidly,firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet. The motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick, repeat 3 or 4 times and whadda u know! The edge is now smooth and nice.",positive
"I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin, but for more chord strumming style playing, such as playing rhythm, the .73's are perfect. They are flexible, but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However, they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So, i dont see how you can go wrong.",positive
"These Dunlop 88 mm picks are the right size, not to big or too small.  Been using these for years.  Always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases.  They never wear out.  They are not too stiff or too flimsy.  They work good for the sound on the strings.  Easy to hold on to.",positive
"I ordered these because I bought a variety pack of picks from Musician's Friend and there was one lonesome very thin celluloid pick in the pack. I loved how it quieted the strumming on my acoustic dreadnought, so I went on the hunt for very thin picks. The celluloid one fell apart quickly, so I wanted a better material.These white nylon picks should last a lot longer. The non-pointed end is all grippy (textured), so it doesn't work great if you like to use the more rounded corners of a pick, but it does the job and I like it. The pointed end is very thin and slides off the strings nicely, but you can still pick with it if you're combining picking and strumming.I'll keep using thicker picks for picking-only songs and for louder strumming, but for more mellow strumming and to keep from bothering other folks in the house, these are great.UPDATE: I've been using them for more than a year now, and they are pretty flimsy for picking notes in a mostly-strumming song... but you can do it. This is still my favorite pick for strumming. Hope this helps.",positive
"OK, so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything, depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However, I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw, folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be.",positive
"These picks are nylon, so each one will last you a couple of years (as long as you don't lose them!!) this is thicker than the .60mm, so you can dig into the strings a little better, but still a hair flimsier than the Snarling Dogs .73mm picks (I know, they're the same size, but trust me these are &#34;flimsier&#34;), and the grip is ok. You can't go wrong here.",positive
"alright I got tired of forking over 30 cent a pick at my local guitar store for instant gratification and decided to get some more online, and let me tell you, these picks get the job done. don't expect to be playing metal with these as they are on the soft side but work well for casual playing along with some heavy palm mutes and stuff like that. a few of the tips broke off but I think that's my fault for playing too hard :) Great picks, would recommend to anyone.",positive
"I use the Dunlop .60mm nylon picks as my current standard,  but decided to give the lighter .38mm a try.  Unfortunately,  the volume they produce get completely swallowed up when accompanying singing with an acoustic guitar (especially in an outdoor picnic setting),  and basically unusable for that purpose.  However, I did find these were just the ticket for personal practice, allowing me to hear a  metronome or backtrack far easier.  So although they failed my original performance intention, 5 stars for filling a need I didn't even know I had.  :)",positive
This nylon pick has great play feel.  It is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still feels comfortable stumming chords.,positive
"These picks are nice and thin, just what I was looking for in a pick.  They seem durable so far and the light color makes them easy to see when you drop one or set it down.  I'm satisfied with these picks.",positive
"This picks are comfortable, nice quality. They'll get dirty as they are cream (or white as I see) but worth it!! Wanna play fast? take these n try em out",positive
These picks have just the right amount of give to really make strumming sound nice and clean. Very forgiving on technique also. Great for beginners.,positive
"I only use Dunlops. For a number of reasons. First, the texture of the plastic gives a good sound, and easier to hold on to. Second, the ""grippy"" texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to. Thirdly, they make many sizes, for all the right occasions. Two thumbs up! Use these for general acoustic guitar strumming, they are not too thin and not too thick. I use the .60mm, .48mm, and .38mm. sizes.",positive
"i purchased the .38mm and these (.46mm).  after using the .38mm and learning how to use the pick now i feel better using these.  i like the small amount of texture provided in the grip area.  not too much, but at least something.",positive
"Normally I prefer a harder pick but I switch to these after 9pm when playing my acoustic guitar to keep the peace with the neighbors. These super light flexible nylon picks are great if you're trying to play quietly. If you prefer a flexible, softer pick as many people do these are also excellent for your regular go to pick.",positive
ive been using dunlop nylon standard picks since the early 80s. they have never let me down. very comfortable in the hand.,positive
I'm not sure what else to say. The picks work well and they don't wear out easily. I like these because they have a nice grip and when my fingers get sweaty they don't slide out.,positive
"the are last forever! much better than plastic ones, especially if you stay in the light thickens.  TH ANK you!",positive
"The .6 MM pick has just the right amount of flexibility without flapping around like thinner picks. And the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing. I know people use yogurt containers, credit cards, bird feathers and even coffee stirrers for picks, but for me, the consistency of the Dunlop pick can't be beaten. And the price is right, too!",positive
"I only use Dunlops. For a number of reasons. First, the texture of the plastic gives a good sound, and easier to hold on to. Second, the ""grippy"" texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to. Thirdly, they make many sizes, for all the right occasions. Two thumbs up!",positive
"Perfect fit for me. I don't like a pick that is to stiff, and I like the grip. My hands sweat a lot so I really need the grip.",positive
Durable and affordable. The .60mm is a perfect thickness for those looking to strum and occasionally pick.,positive
"I'm an Irish-style DADGAD guitarist.  These picks cut through the string really nicely, and are great for driving rhythms.  I'm starting to lean towards the Tortex .5mm, though -- I think the roughness on the surface of the Dunlops adds a little bit of scratch to the sound that I don't like.  Still, great picks.",positive
"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career. I rock hard. Acoustic, electric, and Bass! I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily. Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break, and once you find the thickness that fits your needs, you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career. Buy these picks.",positive
"Pretty flexible due to the 0.60mm thickness, I would recommend the Dunlop Max Grip picks over these picks.  The Max Grips have a much better grip.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.",positive
I like a flexible pick and these at .60mm work just fine.  They are also in a good color so they don't stand out too much.,positive
"i'm a beginner on play guitar and most time i play strumming in church praise team. when i play faster songs, thick gauge picks are very easy to lose. so i like to play with thin gauge picks. i have used the 0.46mm (white)one and i want to make the guitar sound more brighter. i pick this gray one and i played last friday and sunday worship, it made sound that i desired and it wouldn't fly away from my hand while i was plying fast praise songs.",positive
"As a vast multitude of guitar players will solemnly agree, we all have experienced the search for the personal Holy Grail of guitar picks.  I am no exception.  Dozens and dozens of makers, styles, shapes, gages,  materials,  price ranges, (oh ya, the 30 dollar picks), you name it, I've tried it (even nail picking on metal strings).  Now if you are new to the &#34;perfect pick quest&#34;, you must understand that picks are as subjective as scent, with personal grip, sound interaction, a host of music ingredients making your Grail different.  However, if you play a light metal-string acoustic (my main is an Aria AF tenor guitar), check out these Dunlops .60 Nylons.Even within the Dunlop line, I have tried the different grips and thickness gages, and after all said and done, these relatively cheap picks are all that have remained standing as my first choice.  Just heavy enough to be heard unplugged without folding the pick around my thumb, light enough to strum fluidly without yanking at my lighter strings, just the right material to keep my low strings thumping and my high strings singing.  Even the Dunlop Nylon Max grip of the same .60 gage didn't acoustically perform quite the same.Would I try another pick if the chance was presented?  Sure, most of us would since the quest for the Holy Grail never truly ends,  but until then, Dunlop's .60 Nylon is without hesitation the closest thing I have gotten to pick perfection.",positive
These just happen to be my favorite.I always keep .46mm .60mm and .73mm sizes on hand. (mostly use the .60's) I've been using them for years and so will probably never change. I like the 'grippiness' of them .... I hate smooth picks.Picks are cheap so just keep trying different ones until you find one you like.,positive
"I think many/most guitarists are always on the lookout for new things and picks are and easy and cheap thing to try.  My favorite picks for the last ~8 years are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks - they're nylon picks that have a raspy ""cat's tongue"" surface that makes it super easy to grip.I've also had a few of these Gator Grip picks for a few years now and I like them quite a bit, but they're not my favorite.  I tend to use something around or just under 1 mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic.  These picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them.  Sound-wise I don't find that they're significantly different from any other pick.  If they ever stop making Brain Picks these could very well become my #1.",positive
"I've been using the Dunlop Delrin 500 2.0 picks.  Purple ones with the turtle/500 on them.  I thought I had found my pick.  Because they were so slippery, I had to rough up each side to have enough texture to improve the grip (I'd rub each flat side against the edge of a honing stone).  At the music store I stumbled on the Dunlop Gator Grip 2.0.  Yes they do offer a better grip (I think they're still a little slippery but much better than the Delrin 500).  But since I solved that problem with the honing stone, I was more curious.  So - again, they are better, grip wise, but I was very surprised at the difference in tone.  They give a much mellower tone than the 500s and since I'm using these with flat wound 12s on an archtop - the less bright sound often is a better tone overall.  500s seem to be a harder material and are brighter.  I don't know what the Gators are made of but I do like the difference in sound. I'm not sure how they'd work on round wound strings - but great for jazz tones.",positive
"Smooth sound and attack. Grips soft, loose, and yet well. I own HUNDREDS of picks. These are some of my favorites.",positive
"I've been playing for more than 30 years. There are a lot of great products out there and I've tried a lot of them. I have to say that the feel and tone of these grey Dunlop Gatorgrip 2mm picks surpasses the Dunlop yellow gels, Fender 351 X-heavies, and Golden Gate or Dawg mandolin picks. This is just my opinion, but I hope you'll check them out because I'm sure you won't be disappointed!",positive
"It's a pick... everyone has their preference, but I happen to like the 1.14's a lot and the &#34;powder-y&#34; grip on these is a real bonus.  It take a bit to wear that off but they are still good when they are &#34;clean&#34; as well.",positive
You can't go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick.  They have a better grip and a more full sound (to my ears) over the Tortex picks.  I have since went to the Jazz picks but these picks are a solid product.,positive
This pick is great for strumming. Some people are complaining about the grip but they are better than celluloid picks in that regard. If you are looking for the best grip you need to find a pick that has a textured grip.,positive
Since they were named &#34;Gator Grip&#34; I expected them to have a good gripping surface.  That was not the case.  The entire material and holding surface is the same material.  Also they weren't as large as I expected.  They are still usable as decent picks.,positive
"I'm glad I tried these, I wont order them again. I thought they might be a good alternate for my Dunlop nylon picks, not really though.Edit: Im nothing if not fair. My last review of these was in the context of my playing my Strat or sometimes my 335. I stand by that review. However, now Im playing my Godin 5th Ave and suddenly these picks are perfect. Ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars. In the end these are the picks I reach for when Im playing the Godin.I will buy these again. I changing my review from 'Just Okay' to ""Contextually Perfect"". Ok I'll add a star, your right I should add a star. There!",positive
"These have been my favorite pick for years now but, I must say that they are not real pointy and I have recently been trying some pointier pick and I'm now on the fence...",positive
"I started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing, and it seems to have made my fingertips slick.  So I have a hard time holding on to picks (when I use them) on upstrokes.  I'm sure I could improve my technique and fix the problem, but it's more fun to blame the pick!  These picks were no different from picks without the &#34;gator grip&#34; IMHO.  But Gorilla Snot worked beautifully.",positive
"I've been trying to find a pick which combines a good grip, the right string resonance for strumming, and enough stiffness for accurate picking and these picks might be the closest I've found so far for my style of playing. I'm a naturally hard strummer so I want a pick that I can hold more loosely, strum more softly, and still get enough clarity and volume. I want to give them 5 stars but I think that would only apply if they were perfect for strumming and picking - they're very good for both but not quite what I would consider the ideal pick for me if one exists. If I were perfectly satisfied with these picks I would never buy any other picks. For now these are my preferred picks but I will keep experimenting with other brands and types of picks in search of that elusive ideal.",positive
"First, I love these picks and used them exclusively for years.  I have dozens of them, they never wear out.  I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band, and never had any issues.  They are very comfortable, and easy to control.Now the bad: the sound.  Not the sound of the plucked not itself, but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable ""plinking"" sound that is audible through your amp.  If all you're playing is loud music, this may not be an issue.  But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics, because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to me.So, too bad.  I think these are great picks, but I'd like them to be made of a softer material.",positive
"I got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them. I generally use a Dunlop 1.0m pick, but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play. This, of course, can be very annoying, especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song.  These Big Stubby picks have solved that problem. They are easy to hold onto, great for leads, and because of the way they are shaped don't hang on to the strings like the regular picks do.  Great picks. Definitely worth the little extra they cost.",positive
"So, these picks are really nice, but the picture is not what you will get.  These picks are translucent purple.  Other than the strange color, they are good picks.  They really do help with speed and accuracy.  Great for mandolin playing.Updated: Amazon has changed the image for this item, so now the picture really does show what you will get.",positive
"I always find it interesting the different opinions about products.  Some don't like the sound, others say these wear out in a day (really -- do you play for 24 hours?).  Some say that the grip is good.  Here's my take -- for what it's worth.  I've listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars.  Round and flat wound strings.  My general take is that these picks give a better, fuller, rounder bigger tone overall.  Compared to the tortex style pick material (1 mm for the tortex).  It's a bit hard to determine if the sound comes from the material, thickness or a combination of both.  Also note, I play with the rounded edge, not the tip.  So the grip in the center of these doesn't quite fit my grip style but it's still ok.  I do find that these get slippery faster than the tortex materials if my hands sweat at all.  I've been subjective in my comparisons -- but this is what I've found so far.  I find that they stand out, sound wise, for the guitars I'm currently playing.  The process of finding the ""right"" pick is never ending and changes over time.  Give these a try and let me know what you think.",positive
"These  picks  R awsome!  I have tremmors  in my  hands  and have a hard thime with pick control.....They Have a Gell  center,  Whitch  tingles,  It feels like muscles are activating in Your Hand  GREAT THERAPUTIC PICKI seem to do better with controll picks rather then ordinary picks.These  picks have a indentation so U know where put UR thumb and index fingerThey really Do what they say....If U have hand problems,  try these.....they really work.",positive
I dont know why they are called big stubby. They are on the small side.  Way to thick for me.  They do sound good though and will last a long time.  I feel like I am playing with a nickle. I like the indentation. Helps the grip a lot. I should have paid more attention to the size and thickness. Still looking for the right picks for me.  If these were slimmer and a bit larger I would buy again.,positive
"The thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one (no pun intended) you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice.  I've used many different types of picks over the years and I've not found the ideal one for me until recently when I decided to use a SilverPick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which I find fits my needs the best and so far it's just a case of getting used to it.  This particular Dunlop pick is as described being fat, stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face.  The hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard.  This makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing.  For me though, I'll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it's not my default or preferred choice for play.",positive
"I admit I'm not the guitar flatpicker some of my friends are, but I find this pick to be perfect for picking mandolin.  The picks have almost zero flex to them, meaning the player has solid control.  I like 'em--even if they are purple.",positive
"When I first got them, I thought that they were going to be cheap, as they felt extremely light and came in the cheap packaging, but it was ok, I wasn't expecting much from them. The picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material. They did not bend at all when I tried to (and believe, me I tried). Pick wearing is virtually non-existent, and I utilize Alt-Picking a lot in my practices. I actually learned my first sweep shred (D major) with these picks within a day of getting them.I highly recommend for the shred guitarist.My only complaint, is that pinch harmonics are kind of hard to do (becuase of the grip) but i got used to it rather quickly.IMPORTANT!!!You can get these in 24 packs at [...] for only $10!!! Free shipping as well!Sorry, Amazon, but that is just to good a deal to pass on...",positive
I have them in purple which makes them stick out.  They have the little cut out to make it easier to grip and hold when I am playing the mandolin.  Already planning on purchasing more.,positive
"These picks have a very unique shape and sound that have helped me play faster with a smoother tone.Unfortunately, these picks did not receive a five-star rating because of their price and lack of durability.  They wear down fast.  Mine are usually worn out after a day of use and I don't think I play particularly hard.  At around $4.50 for six picks, these are some expensive pieces of plastic.However, these picks are so full of awesome that I am compelled to pay a little extra.  I will definitely be buying more.",positive
"Currently my favorite pick, it's thick enough to control and the etching makes it easy to handle. I'd recommend to guitarists for jazz, fusion or the like.",positive
"I first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks. The product description didn't mention that, but I was pleased to receive more than three!My son told me he needed some new picks, and since lately he's been playing Ozzy Osbourne songs I knew he needed a better pick than the standard Fender picks he's been playing with for three years. After hearing him play with these picks, I've noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these. The finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level. My only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks. I wish we could choose the color, or maybe they could send a color assortment. We'll be buying these for a long time to come.",positive
"The right pick is a personal preference. Nothing wrong with Dunlop Stubby Pick, but it's not for me. I bought a pack of 2.0mm  picks last year and loved them but left them in Florida when I went north. I forgot the name of my favorite pick and bought these by mistake.",positive
I bought these wanting to try the nylon Big Stubby but was sent the lexan /clear purple ones instead. I wanted to mention this because the item description is vague(PLYS PK) and the item pictured is nylon. I'm still happy with the purchase these have the same picking dynamics as the Jazz Stubby but they give you a much larger surface to grip.,positive
"I bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect! Then I re-ordered and I got what I think was an acoustic type because they were the same 2.0mm gauge but were too small for me to comfortably hold, so I just ended up with two dozen wasted picks. So just make sure you get the right one.12.5.11 Update: Okay, so I just realized that there are ""Dunlop Stubby Picks"" and then there are ""Dunlop BIG Stubby Picks"" Sorry...",positive
"I've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. They're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick's tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy, sharp almost. After playing a bit, the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually, it really rounds out and you'll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice, you won't care.",positive
"How a guitar pick ""feels"", is such a matter of individual preference, that there really doesn't seem to be much point in trying to rate them, as what I like about a particular type of pick, may not be relevant to another player.  Most picks have high ratings, because players who like that particular type, write reviews that rate them highly.  Obviously, the best thing to do is playing with a pick on your own guitar, but that isn't always possible.  With that said, for what they are worth, here are my thoughts regarding Jim Dunlop's purple colored, Big Stubby 3.0mm picks.I like a pick with a sharp point for better control, and the Big stubby certainly meets that criteria.  The sharp point and the pick's rounded edges, help the Stubby to slide smoothly off of the individual strings, which makes for easier picking.  Besides electric guitar, I find these picks nicely suited for acoustic, and semi-solid body guitars, where the string tension is greater.I had tried the 1.0mm Stubby previously, but the 3.0mm pick is much thicker, and heavier, and has absolutely no ""give"" at all.  I'm still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard.  Although the pick has rounded depressions on each side for the fingers, when picking rapidly, I find that maintaining grip can still be a little tricky.  Keeping the pick clean and dry, does help.My favorite pick had been theDunlop 0.6mm nylon pick, but I am very pleased with the performance and feel of the 3.0mm Stubby.  I can locate the strings easily, and be more precise, while still being able to play with decent speed.  Time will tell, but this may become my new favorite pick.The ""pick pack"" contains 24 picks.  I only paid $2.99, which is simply an outstanding deal.  If you're a player looking for a really stiff almost indestructible pick, you might want to give this ultra heavy duty Stubby a try.",positive
"I use different kinds of picks, this one is very special, the strings rings out really pleasant, and great for speed picking too!",positive
"As a beginner guitarist, a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks, partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully, that makes sense).  However, when I was handed one of these, it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say, now that I have my own guitar, I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed.",positive
"I've been playing guitar my entire life. And I've tried almost every pick there is. After hearing how great it is, I decided to buy it. It felt really small at first, and i kinda was dissapointed. I put it down, and didn't use it for quite some time. For some reason i decided to pick it back up, and after a few minutes i came to like the pick. Days after using it, i got accustomed to its size, and I became much more efficient with picking. And I no longer had to worry about the pick slipping. I can't really go back to normal sized picks now.. haha. That's like the only downside I can think of. There are many dif versions of this style, so buy em all, and try em out. If these don't work for you, you can always buy the V-pick.",positive
"Real nice Guitar Picks. It came in a 6 piece pack, they deserve the Dunlop brandname because these things last a long time.",positive
it's kinda small for my hand but it works great! it's more easier to pick the string. This pack comes with 6 picks.,positive
"I've been using only these even since trying them, wonderful picks for speed and precision, you won't go back for sure.",positive
"These are shred picks, they are very accurate. Pinch harmonics come easily. The point is made to scream over wound strings, gallops, are a breeze. I gave one to the other guitarist in my band now he only uses them.",positive
"I love these picks. Great for lead playing, and with small fingers like I have, they feel great! Nice quality pick.",positive
"After you use these the large, flimsy old school picks will be used just when you don't have one of these babies available.  These are the best picks out there.  If you don't have these already you better purchase them now.  Black or Red, the color is the only difference.",positive
"just to let people know off the bat i can tell you these picks are small, and if you are used to big picks these might turn you off for a while. But trust me when i say that once you get used to these picks and you start using proper technique these picks will improve your technique rapidly.i never thought i would say that a pick helped me improve playing but it does. now when i try any bigger pick i even use those picks with more skill now because of these picks. trust me if you put up with these picks for a while and you get used to them you will improve or at least i and many other people agree. :D",positive
"Give these picks three days and you'llNever go back to another style.Almost impossible to slip out of your fingers, great tone, amazing clarity, effortless harmonics, durable and fast.This pick literally makes you play better!",positive
They work good.  Way to stiff and small for me though.  Great attack but holding onto it is the problem.  The slick finish makes it kinda hard to hold onto and the small amount of pick that shows makes strumming difficult without hitting your finger on the strings.  I imagine it would work great for lead players but I'm a rhythm player.,positive
"Nice tone, very easy to grip, last me a long time. One of my favorite picks I've tried for electric. Don't enjoy them as much on acoustic.",positive
They are half the size of a regular pick.  Bit too thick for me.  Sound nice. Will last forever. Wish I had sized them before I bought them.,positive
I love these little guys. The small size forces me to hold it so just the very tips is exposed. They have a nice textured grip. I bought the red ones this time so I can see them when I drop them!,positive
I used to use Fender medium picks only. Now for Jazz and metal I use this pick. You will just have to try it for yourself to see if it is right for you.,positive
"I have always been a thin or medium 351 style pick person, but when a fellow musician had one of these on stage I was quite surprised at how well it worked. I have used it on guitar and also on bass and it really works well with a good solid grip to it.",positive
"Been using these for longer than a decade, and met many people who prefer minimal picks , and jazz III among them. This is the closest to playing with bare hand that I can get.",positive
I bought this in a few colors so my other reviews are on as well.  I like the thickness of this pick.  Easy to hang onto when strumming.  Love the tone I can obtain too.,positive
"the title says it all. it may take a while getting use to these smaller picks but in the long run you will e happy that you tried these picks. also since these picks are smaller, i found it was easy to do pinch harmonics on these compared to bigger picks, so if you are having a hard time with pinch harmonics try these out.",positive
"I bought these and used them for a week before giving my review.If Amazon used half-stars, I would have given them 3.5/5. I just couldn't bring myself to give them a 4/5 so I went with 3/5, here's why:I've used standard medium picks for over 20 years. Switching to these was not a problem at all. Sure, they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems. By far the biggest change was the &#34;pointy-ness&#34; of the picks. The distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing, especially when playing chords. Everything is much more pronounced, which isn't necessarily a good thing in my opinion. It's especially bad when playing clean electric (picking notes or strumming).If someone was to ask me if these are good picks, my answer would be &#34;it depends.&#34; It really does, in my opinion, it depends on what you're playing. From a rhythm standpoint, I don't like these at all - they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me. For lead work they are OK because you can really dig into each note and have it come through.Could I play faster with them? No. Could I pull off amazing licks that I couldn't do with my normal picks? No.I tried them, but didn't like them. Maybe if you typically play a TON of lead work, constantly, these would be the way to go. I don't, and they aren't for me. I'm glad I tried them, though, because I'll never wonder again if they were for me.",positive
"I've used these for more than two years but recently shifted to its big brother, the jazz 3 XL. Same thickness and feel /tone, but in a larger form factor. I would definitely recommend the XL version if rhythm+lead work is required. For strictly solo work with easy to achieve pinch harmonics, this one is better.",positive
"I bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out.  The ""gel"" in the name sounded intriguing.  These are OK, the colors are bright, but otherwise they're just standard plastic picks, which on an electric I prefer nylon because it's less ""clicky"" on the strings.  These are fine, and if I pull one out of my gig bag I'll use it, but overall there are other styles of pick that I'd buy before buying these again.  Nothing wrong with them, but they're just normal plastic picks, nothing special other than maybe the brightness of the colors.",positive
"I tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably. In fact, they were so good that I purchased ten more when I went back to the same music store. My favorites are mandolin picks like Golden Gate or Grisman ""Dawgs"". The round side of the XH Dunlop Gels gives me a similar attack and a nice warm tone. I would recommend these to anyone.",positive
"If for some reason you're looking for a pick with a specific color, this is a nice set. The bright colors make them difficult to lose.",positive
I have used the Extra Heavy picks for many years but am still searching for that perfect pick. Its strong enough to play metal and some blues style rifts but not so strong it cracks and brakes. I do like the fact it wont turn to powder or fray while playing either but it does wear out fast when playing on heavy gauge strings.,positive
"I recently ordered a wide variety of picks to find the ones I liked best. These sounded different ""gel"" picks. I do not like them. Being see through distracts me. They are a little scratchy on the edges. Perhaps a more experienced guitar player would do fine with them but being at the stage where I am still looking at what I am doing - I just can't use them well.",positive
"Not too light and bendy, not too heavy and stiff, these picks are just right. Dunlop also makes quality picks, and I have yet to break one of these. They last a long time. I am a guy so at first I wished they weren't purple, but since Dunlop only codes their sizes with certain colors I like them so much I don't really care what color they are anymore. I bought a pack of these picks for much less money at my local music store so I would recommend looking there first. Now please stop cutting up milk jugs and go buy these. Now!",positive
They play well and hold up well(never had one break) They are my second favorite pick. But this pick is better in some songs than my favorite.,positive
"I actually forgot that I bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick.  It's not a bad pick, I will continue to use them but I wish they had a softer center, or softer coating where you grip the pick to prevent it from turning or falling out of my fingers.",positive
For keeping your guitar picks where you can quickly grab them the Dunlop mic stand pick holder is EXTREMELY efficient and useful ESPECIALLY when performing live.Always great products and always dependable.I also own the guitar maintenance kits and the capo.Not one product has let me down yet.My capo is 8 years old.,positive
"As I mentioned in the title, this simply snaps to the stand and holds picks. Enough said. It does its job and does it ok for my taste.",positive
I love these pick holders.  They're easy to get on and off.  They hold a nice amount of picks.  And you get that rock-star feel (throw picks at the audience).  A must for any gigging guitarist.,positive
Holds my picks in place  nicely... snaps on 2 microphone stand firmly...  Never come up short again...  Its just a nice accessory to have and cheap too,positive
I have the small version. But for the price of this version is more useful for a few dollars more. I used in all my concerts and its excellent! 100% recommended!,positive
"Fits nicely on my mic stand and hold a butt load of picks. It is quite tight on my picks, but I imagine it will loosen slightly as it gets used.",positive
"I drop my pics on purpose now just so I can use it more often! It does what it's supposed to do, what else can I say.",positive
"I bought this thing not thinking I would use it too much, but wanted it for future use, I was wrong, no more misplacing picks for me. Highly recommended, also fits on my guitar stand, very cool.",positive
"There isn't much to say about this product, except it works as advertised.  If you don't have one of these and you are a live performer, I highly recommend you pony up the few dollars and pick one up (pun intended).",positive
I tend to drop picks from time to time and it's nice to have them at the ready when the time arises.This was a basket filler when I needed to get to $25 for my free shipping one day but I find it very useful and use it every time I play.Don't know why I waited so long to get one..,positive
Works really well! This is very convenient for when your on stage and are switching to fingering style or something. You can just drop the pick in your hands and pick a new one up when ready.,positive
This pick holder is awesome. It just snaps on to your mic stand...add 6 picks and start rockin'! It holds the picks securely so if you're performing outdoors the wind wont blow them away.,positive
"The mic stand pick holder is a great way to keep picks available while playing.  I switch between playing guitar and bass so I often change the gauge of the pick I am using.  This pick holder is a great way to have the picks available if you change picks often. The holder snaps firmly to the arm of the mic stand and does not slide around the arm. It holds the picks firmly, there is no chance they will fall out of the holder.",positive
"If you can't find a container and add your own sponge, then buy this.Keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential.I think this item should cost three bucks at most, and $1.50 would still yield a healthy profit!I made some more from stuff from the dollar which I think are better.I use this one for my baritone uke, and the bigger ones I made I use in my dreadnaughts.If you make your own, just make sure to not let the sponge drip, ie, wring it out, and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood.",positive
"Excellent product, simple and practical design,holds firmly inside the guitar mouth and keeps humidity levels in the safe zone.If humidity levels in your area go below 40% you simply need to provide extra humidity to prevent cracks.",positive
"Planet Waves humidifiers are simple to use and a great product to guard against drying your guitar and causing splitting. Dampen the sponge, squeeze out excess water, insert the sponge into the holder and the holder between hte strings. Check on it every few days and keep the sponge damp. Couldn't be any easier. I use them all winter long in my guitars.",positive
"It's nothing special.  No frills, just a simple concept that works.  It's important to maintain humidity in your instrument, especially in a dry climate like west Texas.  The evaporation rate will depend on the amount of humidity in the air where you store your instrument.So, when you first start using it, you have to be diligent to check the sponge regularly to ensure that it is still moist.",positive
"This compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe.  If you don't over-fill, it will not drip, and you can simply place it in your case instead of the usual sponge.",positive
"Purchased this to replace the Dampit as a no drip alternative. With the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use. Distilled water will extend the life of the sponge. Overall simple and effective.However, I may have added too much humidity. Was using in conjunction with humidipak to keep them from drying out thinking they would absorb any excess humidity, but I then noticed an irregularity in the reflection of the pick guard and the tone seemed to be muted so shifted over to humidipak only and will re humidify them outside the guitar case.I do use a hydrometer but I don't think it was effectively reading the inside of the guitar, but only the inside of the case.So I think the Planet Waves humidifier works well for its intended purpose, but you do have to monitor that you are not over or under utilizing it.",positive
"I have an electronic indoor/outdoor thermometer that shows relative humidity and a whole house humidifier.It is interesting to see just how quickly relative humidity changes inside and outside with that electronic thermometer.The whole house humidifier pumps out about 3 gallons of water a day into a 1500 sq ft house during the fall and winter keeping the indoor humidity around 47%.This makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier. Makes the whole house safer for the Martins.Now you can use a little in the case humidifier like this to help with humidity, but I think you really need a whole house solution and a monitor system.A sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too. Just don't get water on the wood.And don't forget to take the silica gel packs out of the little accessory compartment in the case. Many guitars come shipped with these and their job is to remove humidity from the case.All the better acoustic guitar shops I go to have a big humidifier running in their showrooms.",positive
"I thought I would throw my two-cents in about the new design and effectiveness of this soundhole humidifier.After making a few homemade case humidifiers out of things like a travel butter container with many holes drilled into it and a sponge, I started thinking about how some of the cases separate the body cavity from the neck & headstock cavity inside the guitar case and not allowing the humidity to flow freely to all areas, especially the body where it is needed the most.Even though I was getting acceptable humidification in the case I was concerned about the body being dryer in comparison so I went ahead and splurged the 8 bucks on these. (I actually bought three of them.)I crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and A/C in the summer, keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet. The humidity drops quite low, but the sponges remain moist for several days before I can no longer fight the urge to re-wet them. lol.Two great tips in one:Use a regular, more dense sponge, thicker like the ones at the dollar store. Cut them to size and stuff them in!Throw away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and don't worry about distilled water, unless you want to. I can't argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets, but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size, and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced.Don't worry about the &#34;thing&#34; hanging in-between your strings. It will not damage anything unless you get the sponge  too saturated and it leaks. I will either squeeze the excess water out, or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am satisfied that it won't drip.The humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole.If you ARE rough, careless, thoughtless, or stupid, you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out, but I would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen. This would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause.The top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover. The sponge inside is quite small, and there isn't too much room for a much larger sponge. The device is simple and fairly solid. Treat it gently and it will last forever. You can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher. If you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills, I'm sure it would be a decade before anything &#34;built up&#34; to require extensive cleaning or replacement.Keep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re-wetting the sponge.Try to keep the sponge moist when it's dry.I strongly suggest getting an Oasis case humidifier, (or similar) mini sized about 1&#34; X 4&#34; costing around 17-20 bucks.This will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case.Remember, too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp. Too dry and it will shrink and crack, split the soundboard (top) also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive!If you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and/or dry, you would be negligent (if not careless) to spend the pittance to make sure your 'baby ain't thirsty', or worse...dead & broken!Hope this helps!",positive
I wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick. My guitar would probably not be happy without it.,positive
"This is a upgraded version of the guitar humdifier, The first one had that green stuff that florists use in it and you used a plastic syringe to ad water to it. This has a replaceable sponge, you take it out, soak it and squeeze out excess then put it back in container, would say it gets more humidity out.",positive
"It's simple, basic, but I don't think it does that good of a job. This is because it doesn't really humidify that much and doesn't extend very far into the guitar.",positive
A simple system for gettting humidity into the guitar; The price is just right and it is very simple to use.,positive
"This is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole.  It would not work for an f-hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele.  Inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge.  If you use distilled water (as recommended) it should last quite a while.  The top comes off with a gentle press on the sides.  The dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly.  Don't push it all the way in after moistening and you won't have a problem.  I drip a little distilled water on the sponge, squeeze out any excess, and the assembled case pops in easily between the D and G strings, suspended in the middle of the sound hole.  They can't be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings.  I've never had one of these move from where I left it.If the sponge isn't dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case.  When the humidity is very low (30% or less) the sponge dries out in 2 to 3 days even if the case isn't opened.  As with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days.If you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar (or don't want to see one) use a guitar humidifier!  Especially during the winter - heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels (between 45% and 60% is ideal for most guitars).  Air conditioning can do the same.  For especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar(s) is okay.  For many reasons it's always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use.  A humidifier is inexpensive extra precaution at those times of year when temperature or humidity changes quickly.",positive
"I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy, except distilled water.  In all actuality, its a really simple design.I like this design better because of one simple fact.  If the wood in your guitar is already dry, you'll have to refill your humidifier more often initially.  i'd rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers.  After the guitar gets ""hydrated?"", I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days.  It definitely gets taken several time between refills, so it's not that much of a hassle.Overall, good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother.  Try not to over-douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar.Peace out and cheers~J",positive
Fits nicely into my acoustic guitars. Just requires you to dampen the sponge with distilled water. Luckily I keep that on hand!,positive
I bought this guitar humidifier for my Taylor.I received exactly what I purchased and works as it should.This product has been recommended to me by many other guitar players around me.It is a simple design that fits perfectly between the strings.Easy to use because really all you have to do is moisturize the sponge and keep it in the plastic container.Price is good.,positive
"Works for me. But It splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it. They made it thinner so it doesn't stretch the strings too much & as a consequence, it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as Arizona & California is concerned.Suggestion to Planet Waves: I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings, redesign the mount, say with a Velcro so that it's still hangs on the sound hall but it's attached to the strings. It's possible to attach your product in a different way because I've modified mine & to my personal preference works without splitting the screen.",positive
I have one of these in every one of my cases. It's a plastic sponge holder with holes in it; nothing special but it does the job.,positive
"This is good for now! Keeps my guitar from drying out, warping, cracking,! For the money it works! Recommend this product.",positive
"We all know it's just a container with a sponge in it, no biggie. I bought it to get Super Saver shipping on something else and because I plan to keep an all-solid acoustic guitar at a weekend place where it will sit unused for long periods of time. Jamming it between the guitar strings and getting it hooked onto them feels a bit rough on the strings. But it should do the job.",positive
Cleans your strings and makes your fingers go across the strings a little faster.This is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long way.It is VERY safe for guitar finishes.,positive
"That cloth... They should have included something that doesn't fall apart.Otherwise it's great. I use it as recommended by the container and it keeps the strings nice and conditioned, but I'm with other people here who commented that you can't really tell how much of the stuff is left inside. Good idea to keep more than one of these around.",positive
"I play 5-string bass, both electric and acoustic and love this stuff.  Each bass I have has different strings for various reasons and I use this on every one.  My wife uses on her 6-string acoustic and electric guitars.  We keep a can in every case!",positive
"Fast Fret, or at least some kind of string cleaner is a 'must have' for anyone who plays guitar. Because, if you think about it, strings get really dirty over time, and this product solves that issue. :)",positive
"There's not much to say about this product, except that it works. It makes my strings last longer. Sometimes I get lazy owning so many guitars, and 20 minutes per &#34;well done&#34; restring adds up. This is a great way to put that off and keep jamming for as long as possible. It's small and conveniently stored too. I recommend trying it out!",positive
I have used Fast Fret for a number of years and think it's a great product.  It now comes in a metal can and has a cap over the applicator versus the old plastic can with no cap over the applicator.  This is a much better way to package the product and will probably help it retain the lubricant longer.,positive
I really love this. Tends to be very linty with time but it is still a very good product. Recommended.,positive
"I am in agreement with others that state this is a must-have. I battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard. This really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood. I've used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard. I rub the entire neck down before and after I play. It makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop, which I suspect is what they must've been using all these years and never told me, though I never did ask...foolish me. Since I've recently gotten into doing my own setups, where I've read many forums and posters have recommended this and I figured what the heck, it's less than $5.",positive
"I discovered this string lubricant many years ago and I concur with what most of the reviewers here have said about it although I wouldn't call it a string cleaner although you indirectly clean the strings if you use the cloth and like another reviewer stated you should also use the cloth to clean the undersides of your strings as well.  I unfortunately live in a very humid climate being only a little above the equator and so strings have a very short life here and so anything that can prolong their life is a real boon for a musician here.  I agree that the only downside is the inability to tell in advance that you are running low on lubricant until it actually turns dry but I guess given the price and the overall usefulness of this accessory, one cannot complain too much.  Now that mine has just run dry I'm going to delay a replacement purchase while I try out something new that I've just discovered called ""The Swipe"" which enables me to clean both the undersides and the topsides of my strings without chemicals.  If this works as well as advertised, I may still get Fast-Fret but for its lubricating properties which really helps make playing a lot more comfortable.Recommended!",positive
"The name says it all. FAST fret = FAST fingers!  I played over 40 live shows from 45 min sets to 2.5 hr sets just this year on national stages.  My strings take a lot of abuse and slow down with all the sweat, grime, and dirt flying through the air. This stuff honestly works very well.  It is part of my regular arsenal.",positive
"Especially for the price, this is a great buy.  The strings on my acoustic were starting to get a bit loud when I would slide up and down the fretboard, and I was noticing quite a bit of lag when sliding too.  The only downside is that it would be much easier to apply this directly to the frets without the strings on, but the appeal is to bring life back to strings that aren't shining like they use to.  I just had to take a little extra time and care to get as much oil onto the fretboard and then make sure I wiped it in/off as thoroughly as possible, which required folding the provided rag and inserting it between the strings and fretboard and taking my time as I went from fret to fret.  Not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing.  The ease of sliding was tremendously improved and the strings sound and feel better than ever!  Take 10-15 minutes and do you and your guitar a favor...",positive
"I just got this yesterday so I don't know how long it will prolong the string's life but I have noticed a difference already. It's a lot easier to play since the strings feel a lot smoother which makes this worth buying for that alone. Also, it's cheap so I would give it a shot if I were you. I'm really happy that I ""discovered"" this product, in fact, I'm already ordering 2 more.",positive
This is my fifth time buying this stuff! I really like the new container. The tin is way nicer than the old plastic one. This stuff works great and lasts forever! I play daily and one stick will last me at least a year before it gets too dirty/dry to use. One swipe is plenty (2 strings at a time from nut to bridge); then just fold the cloth and wipe clean. Makes moving power chords and soloing so much easier.,positive
"I have been using GHS Fast fret for over six years and it's amazing stuff, I apply just a tiny amount to the strings before I play and then wipe them down afterwards, I used to change strings every one to two months and now strings can last me a year. It's easy to control home much you put on and one can of this stuff lasts me a year or two, there isn't really any reason to just soak everything with it I don't think, I mainly use it to clean the strings. I'm really glad I found this stuff!",positive
Very nice product. Strings feel and sound noticeably better plus the white mineral oil smells really good when applied to the neck.,positive
I used this on a bass guitar with older strings and it made the strings brighter and more lively. I will try it on all of my guitars as it will prolong the life of most strings. I like the packaging and the small cloth it comes with. I use sections of t shirts to clean my strings and put them inside the packaging along with the cloth. This is a must for any fingerpicking guitar or bass player.,positive
"This product is great, I use it after every session. Keeps your strings clean and conditions the fret board. Every guitar player should keep this in their case.",positive
Not an expert but it is cheap and simple and cleans and protects the strings. Hope that helps thank you,positive
"This makes sliding on the bass real smooth. It's also nice for cleaning. It is hard to tell if you are running low on oil or whatever liquid is in this thing but they seem to last for a fairly long time. And it's super easy to apply. Even though you're not a pro, act like one and slap some of this stuff on your bass or guitar before you play.",positive
"I agree with all of the reviews, but have found another area to use fast fret on: THE NUT. When tuning, the strings (especially the lower wound strings) hang up on the nut which causes the string to pop instead of slide as it would on a roller nut. Dab Fast Fret onto the nut before tuning, and this problem is greatly reduced.",positive
"I got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards (well duh!)  Does it work?  Yes and no.  First it did not appear that anything was coming out.  After a bit of rubbing I did notice a &#34;slight&#34; bit of solution (turns out its mineral oil)on the fretboard by the frets.  I tried to spread it out with the included cloth and discovered that the cloth was useless (a paper towel would hold up better- seriously!)  I used an old tee shirt square and spread some of the oil around- but honestly it took me 10 to 15 mins and I noticed NO difference in the appearence or the playability of the guitar.  It says to use it before and after each session- thats about 30 mins of my time per guitar (I general play 2 guitars durning the course of a session).  I do still use this occasionally, but I would not spend money to purchase it again.  Just not what I was looking for in a fret board cleaner.",positive
"Let's cut to the chase: this is, more or less, a tight roll of gauze soaked in mineral oil.  But that's exactly what I need to clean and protect my fretboard.  The lubricating feature is just a nice plus.",positive
"I used this on a 5string bass. I liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier. My friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it.Her reason for her opinion is simple. This stuff puts out a LOT more oil (or whatever it is) than you would think. This has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hard-earned callouses soft...which when playing guitar can lead to bleeding fingers pretty fast (and did for my friend).To apply this you simply hold the handle and press down while running it along each string, one string at a time. I highly suggest you only use one slide down each string. At first it may not look like anything is getting on your strings, but give it a few minutes and you will start to see the excess oil appear and start pooling under the strings on your fretboard. That's ok. You will need to wipe away the excess, and I'm telling you, if you accidentally get too much, that excess oil may not come off easily (didn't for me at least). Mine left little pools of oil between the frets, and I only used one swipe and thought I had just a little on there. Naturally, this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling. My friend hated that part too, and I agree with her. Soft callouses = no callouses. This is a good product idea, and I like it in theory, and with my thick bass strings I didn't have the severe problem w soft fingertips that she did. Just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you.It does what it says, but you may not like what else it does or how it feels on your fingers.",positive
I've already posted about Fast Fret.  I love this stuff.  It's a mandatory inclusion in every one of my guitar cases.,positive
The best buy for your bass drum,positive
These patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads. Even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most. As far as I can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all. They stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time.If you have a double bass kick pedal I highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company.,positive
These impact pads came very fast and do their job although one of the pad I received ive already warn through in less then 3 weeks,positive
This has saved my bass drum head from many holes. Also has no affect on sound of bass drum.Would recommend.,positive
"This works, and I really like Evans. But I got 2 of these and they both looked different and looked cheap. Although I have been using it for awhile now with hard use and it is holding up great and saving my kick drum head from abuse.",positive
The Evans Pedal Patch will work for you great.. It will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty..  I cheap buy and it works excellent..,positive
In writing a simple review for such a simple product there's only a few concerns you should have. 1. Would the adhesive dry out on this and 2. does it wear over time? The answer is it gets 4 stars. It doesn't dry out but I had to replace mine after 5 years because it eventually wore out. That's pretty good! Not perfect but pretty god!,positive
"They add depth to your bass drum by muffling the overtones a bit, and it is the pads that wear out rather than your bass drum head so these actually save you money and sound better. I've used a couple different brands, and they pretty much are similar.",positive
"they look slick and work really good, i would recommend this to anyone that needs a bass drum patch or so",positive
I am disappointed that the 1A didn't work with my iPad.  That's what I get for buying a cheap adapter.,negative
"Only works one side at a time. When you connect two cables, one side stop working and also overheated burning the fuses. I purchased two of them and it's the same problem. Cheap and bad quality.",negative
Purchased two and we put one in each car. Now we charge our ipad and iohone together. Can also use to power my Galaxy Note 2 or recharge other USB devices. If you have to think about it you need counseling,negative
"I bought 2 of this and tried to test first ... after few minutes of charging, it felt hot. Pulled it out and the product smelled burnt. Tried the other one too and same thing. Be careful... this one could be fire hazard or could potentially destroy the electrical system",negative
It looked like it was used! It was broken when it got to be the paint job was horrible.I would never get it again,negative
"I've been using this for about 4 months now and it works just as it is intended.  I would buy again.  Quality product.The cord could stand to be a little longer, but it is of a decent length.",negative
"Got this to replace a frayed OEM cord. The cord itself is ok ;however, the plug that looks like OEM and is stamped as such, is crap! Took 8 times longer to charge with this unit! When the cord was paired with the actual OEM plug in, it worked fine. So if you need a cord its ok; however, it is definitely not OEM and the plug is worthless. For the price and really just needing a cord it is a good value but I am very disappointed with the false markings as OEM when it is certainly not.",negative
"although i do not use the charger, the cable is useful.  it is longer than what is given with the phone.  the additional length allows the phone to be placed in plain sight, instead of down by the wall receptical",negative

"I used to be obsessed with changing phone cases, but now I am obsessed with THIS phone case!! What a great find !! 5 STARS",negative
Bought case for me and wife to qualify for free shipping. Came in different colors to match phone.  Can go entire 24 hours without charging; but I am not a kid playing games all day long. No complaints or problems. (Personally I wrote another review in the wrong spot since we had diff phones and diff colors I f&%$ up),negative
"Watch-out, all these positive reviews are fake. Some have even reviewed it twice using the same name. What a sleazy way to sell an item.",negative
"I bought this for the at&t samsung galaxy s2 and the seller was very slow in getting this item to me. I also notice that this product do fit the SGS2, but the cut outs was NOT good. The cut out opening was too small for the power button, there was also an extra cut out for no reason. It does fit nice so I gave it 2 stars, but bad opening for my phone will be costly.",negative
"This is clearly not a HTC cable as it has the Blackberry logo on it and the bulk packaging label says Blackberry...but it's a OEM micro usb cable none the less and works perfectly on any micro usb device I plugged it into.While I haven't tested it's speed against other cables I doubt it outperforms any other OEM cable but it works and that's all I asked for of it.The cable is a bit thick and as a result is stiff but not unmanageably so.It should also be noted that the cable shown in the picture is not of the actual product, that is a mini usb cable and appears to be quite a bit longer than the product, this cable is 1m long.",negative
"I only trust HTC accessories for HTC phones having bad luck with aftermarket products that are cheaper, but cheap is expensive.",negative
well bought this so i could have a spare cord since i have the original cord in my car with a usb charger there got tired of keeping track where i had it last.  so this cord works on when plugged into the wall.  when hooked to a pc phone wont stay connected to the pc to transfer files or anything.  so if you just need a cord to plug into the wall this will work but don't even think of this cord if you want to use it with a pc.,negative
poor manufacturing quality the connector is too long and does not properly fit in my phone. I would not buy this.,negative
"I got this to charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 but it ALWAYS came unplugged from the phone, whenever the phone would be moved it falls out and even just resting on a flat surface it would eventually find its way out of the phone. I had to buy another USB cord because I became very frustrated with this",negative
"Looking at the price, I ordered 2 of these.It served the purpose initially. But in few months one of them stopped working.that's 50% hit rate. Though, I don't what's the life for the other charger.",negative
"The plug fits and it charges my Captivate, it felt rather snug. The ""retractable""-ness of this charger is anything but. Plain ol' doesn't work. I literally took it out of the package, and the first time I pulled the cord out - didn't yank, tug, or otherwise forcefully pull it - about 10 inches and hit the retract button to test it out and it retracted about 2 inches of it. I pulled it out further, retracted about 4 or so inches of it. Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button, it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get. The cable would only automatically retract 2-4 inches at any given length. The main reason I wanted this was for the ""retractability"" since I hate having cables dangling around.Working on getting a refund for this item now.",negative
I've used this for almost 2 years now and it JUST NOW broke. But I can still used it. The button that retracts it just got loose so it doesn't latch anymore.,negative
"took longer than expected to be delivered but over all satisfied with the charger. the retractable cord is just long enough to reach the cup holder in my truck where i usually put my phone. down side, ive already got 2 welps on my arm from retracting the cord! be careful! haha.",negative
"Not much to say, here.  This little charger works well and it was a lot less expensive than Sprint store.",negative
Have this in my office at work for a little extra boost when needed. Nothing fancy just a charger that does what its ment to do.,negative
it was the wrong one.The male end does not fit the Iphone 4s .  Once it was pulled out it would not retract,negative
THIS IS A BAD CHARGER IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY AND IT HAS A REALLY BAD SHORTAGE. I HATE IT!,negative
"I don't think this will last very long.  I was thinking of deploying this in a call center environment, but I don't think it would last very long.  Plus, the cord is too short for desktop use.",negative
"plastic pry tool kinda sucks, but all the other tools in the kit are quite handy, helped me fix a broken screen on a $500 phone so saved a bit of cheddar there.",negative

"Judging from what I've seen in other reviews and what I received there is inconsistency in what is being shipped out.  I received a zip-lock bag containing 12 pieces.

"It's $6 so I don't know if I'm asking too much. The screw drivers work and are slightly magnetized.

I have several revolvers and pistols which have sight adjustments that have outrageously small adjustment screws.

"On the recommendations of a few reviewers, I tried these gels for my Jawbone headset. Unfortunately, they did not fit well and came off every time I took the headset off.

"I have bought other USB hubs in the past, and they all failed. plugging in 2 powered devices would make them not work.This USB Hub I have 4 usb powered hard drives and an external DVD burner plugged in and they all work without any problems! This is one of the best Hubs I have found.",negative
"It's a nice-looking product. It seems like I would have liked it. But...My unit had an electrical problem. I connected two portable external hard drives, one powered external hard drive, a printer, an external DVD+-RW drive, a mouse and a keyboard. Then I plugged it in.First I noticed my mouse didn't work. So I unplugged it and plugged in another one. ""That's strange, that one doesn't work either,"" I thought. ""Hmmm, and what's that smell?""  Turns out, that smell was a hard drive frying.  Once I figured that out I unplugged everything and waited.After a few hours, when I figured everything would have cooled down, I started testing my devices.  One portable external drive still ""sort of"" works. I can see most of the file structure but copying attempts fail. The powered external hard drive mostly worked for a couple days and then quit. One portable hard drive never worked again. The optical drive still works, occasionally, but typically won't boot. Occasionally the printer works. The mice never worked again. And the keyboard was fine.  Everything's been tested on 3 different PC systems and 1 Linux system.The worst part? Those were my redundant data storage. I lost everything.",negative
"I used to be a USB doubter - I thought USB wouldn't catch on.  Was I ever wrong!  Without a hub, I wouldn't have enough USB ports to plug everything in!Over the past several years, I've gotten a number of USB hubs to handle the problem.  I bought a 7-port CyberPower Hub from another vendor to use at work.  It's lasted with day in and day out use for about two years.  One heavy use is that I use a password manager on a USB thumbdrive and it gets plugged in at least twice a day.  The CyberPower hub at work doesn't seem to mind.The hubs at home, and even the USB ports on my motherboards, seem to loosen up and not keep a good grip on the USB thumbdrive.  So, when my home hub flaked out again, I decided to get a hub that I know works, and keeps on working, for use at home.The only drawback to the hub is the LED's on it.  They are a little too bright, and not really all that useful.  However, it's not a problem at work, and at home, the hub is hidden behind a monitor.  I wouldn't want to use it in a bedroom.If you're looking for a reliable hub, this is it.",negative
"I gave this 3 stars because it does what it says, its nothing high end and doesn't promise miracles, but I won't give it 5 stars because simply there's a terrible delay from when my computer comes out of sleep mode and from the time it actually recognizes this hub on the com ports for the PC, on average its about 15 seconds.  So I'll be sitting there waiting to enter my password like an idiot until the hub is finally recognized by the PC.  And its a really good PC, brand new, no problems with USB 2 or USB 3 except where this hub is concerned.",negative
"[Apart from minor issues like stability of the ""weighted"" base, this hub has been such a consistent, heavy-duty performer, while holding its price point (just short of 30) for exactly 4 years, that I've had to award it 5 stars (and order the identical model for my wife).  But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That's fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer's desktop with each start-up.  I'm about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what's going on and whether there's a fix (could it be Apple's latest update to OSX?  I'll be back pending further info.]I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon's picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I'm looking at the CyberPower USB port ""in person,"" I can provide a few initial impressions:1.  It's a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion, it's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to ""fatten up"" the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest ""gripe"": the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I'd look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it's so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there's any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the ""cuteness"" factor; this thing is all business.][4 years later: This ""off brand"" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington ""round mound"" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]",negative

"Amazon continues to ship this antenna with the Wilson Electronics Sleek Booster, and it is not the right antenna. Wilson has told them many times they are shipping the wrong antenna but they continue to do it. This was very frustrating and caused me a lot of grief as I was not able to get on the Internet for a week due to Amazon's problem. I am returning the whole package to Amazon even though Wilson Electronics was able to send me an adapter in the next week or so, but the primary reason I purchased this product was to use over the Holidays where the place we were staying had little reception.  Not being able to use my smartphone hot spot really made me angry.

"They claim this works for Sprint PCS but I got one for my Virgin Mobile MC760 and it won't pick up any signal! In fact it actually makes the signal weaker!  I have to put the MC760 in a window to get a decent signal so I thought putting an antenna on the roof would be better but when I plug it into the MC760 the signal strength goes down! I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it doesn't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive. I tried emailing Wilson but they weren't any help. Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760. I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work. The first one had bad threads and wouldn't go on all the way, the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it. The third one finally did fit correctly but there was still no signal. I don't see how Wilson can get away with selling worthless junk antennas like this, they must get a lot of consumer fraud complaints. I'm sending this useless antenna back for a refund.I purchased a Wilson 301101 trucker antenna, mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great.

It's not perfect, but for the simple task of holding a cellphone, sunglasses, loose change, perhaps your EZ-Pass, it will do the trick.I place a camcorder there to film road trips, and for the most part, it stays put.

"It's a great deal, so i jumped on it. But was truly disappointed. I've so far summed up Motorola products as well really really poor. I own a Razar, wish i could return that! But this headset, thinking it's from motorola would work well with my phone, but no. It's on my belt clip, and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away, signal is weak, and then disconnets. To me that's strange. It's also surprising that this happens randomly, so it's kinda annoying, b/c you can't anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving, b/c you rely on the headset to work properly. Also get the static noise which is weird, b/c it shouldn't do that. especially when driving.",negative
"I've used a number of Bluetooth headsets and this is among the worst. The sound quality is low, especially outdoors, and there is quite a bit of static even when within a few feet of the phone. The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside (with any background noise) it was almost impossible. This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear (earbud style). The microphone is far enough from one's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable, especially if you wear glasses, but not as bad as some others I've tried. It does not flop around much under normal circumstances. I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500, which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price, but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250. I've used those in the past and found them much better overall, and worth the extra price.",negative

"Sidekick II is meant to be your one-stop-shop wireless gadget for e-mailing, web-browsing and IM chatting anywhere you go.  You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie, you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.",negative

I used this phone lifter in combination with the Plantronics CS50 Wireless Office Headset.  It was a powerful combination that allowed me to answer my phone up to 300 feet away from my office. This lifter fits onto your phone base and lifts the receiver when you press a button on your remote headset.  You can answer the phone or hang-up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver.The lifter came with a plug in mini-microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing.  The setup was quick and easy and the device took up almost no space on my desk as it attached to my phone.I spent thousands of hours a year on the phone and this device along with my remote wireless headset saved me a lot of neck stress and phone holding for hours a day.

"I could not be more impressed. I was highly skeptical as I have been buying bluetooth headsets like crazy trying to find one that worked, and they're all pretty much junk. This thing worked all the way out to the sidewalk, and likely much further, but that's as far as I went. The quality on the other end is very clear. The manual is plain stupid, it looks like they were half way through putting it together when they released it, but on the Mac the manual was of course not needed, just plug it in and it worked without any of the driver install nonsense Windows requires. BTW, I am using it primarily with Skype.OK, I have to add something to this review. There's a fatal flaw in this device. A flaw that makes the device near worthless to me now. If the USB cable is unplugged, but the earpiece is left clipped into the holder/charger, the battery runs down within hours. Obviously a simple diode somewhere would have prevented this, but for me the device now is close to useless.Update: May 8th 2011. So, 5 years later, the device is seriously failing. the electronics in the device are dying. I am having to constantly remove the battery to get the headset to work, and it's cutting me off in the middle of calls.

My granddaughter is only five years old, so having the background knowledge of knowing when to stop the action of pulling the drawer from the base requires practice.  I, on the other hand, have had lacks of years of practice with jewelry drawers, but also struggle with removing the drawer without spilling the contents.",negative
"I bought this product a little over a year ago. Now that I am done with it, I wanted to sell it. I put it on eBay and Craigslist. They had their lawyers contact the sites and have them remove the listing.Apparently in the tiny 4-point font disclaimers on the package it says that the license is not transferable, so you can't sell it as a used item after you're done with it.Total crap !",negative
"We got this costume for my son to wear to Disneyland. My daughter likes to dress up like her favorite princess, so he wanted to dress up, too. This costume is better quality than I had anticipated, based on some of the other reviews. It runs a little small, my son is five and the Child M (7-8) fits well over his clothes. The boot covers pull on over the white jumpsuit pants, and the costume can be worn without them. The arm panels, however, remain attached. The suit has an opening in the back, under the hood, for the child to get into it, and the opening has two Velcro dots to close it. This makes it a little bit awkward to get into, and especially awkward to take off to use the bathroom. To use the bathroom, you have to take off the whole top of the costume, and then hold onto it so it doesn't touch a dirty bathroom floor (I definitely had to help my son with this in a public bathroom). He absolutely LOVES the costume, and has worn it everywhere (except school) since he got it.",negative
"Have they lost their minds??!! Over 100$ for a costume!! Amazon, you are an idiot. This is an inexpensive costume. It better include a meeting with Tom Hanks for that price.",negative
My dad travels a lot and that is an understatement. I got this item for him for when he was going to some shady places and he got a lot of use out of it.,negative
"It takes up very little space when not being used,  but has worked great in making it much easier to movie two pieces of luggage with one hand.My only caution is be sure that you snap the pieces together as they were intended to be snapped together. If you snap together with the one piece upside down, you'll need pliers to get them apart. So watch what you're doing and don't be stupid . . . or careless. And don't ask whether it was me or not who was stupid or careless.",negative
"I purchased the X-Lander Military version of this watch (all black, rubber strap).  I've scraped it across several hard objects, and it has yet to show scratches.  I love the compass and reverse display.  You have to be careful when setting up the watch, as it is easy to change the factory defaults on the barometer.  The elevation data seems to change constantly with barometric pressure, but I'm assuming that this is always the case with this type of instrument as its not tied to GPS.  My chief complaint is that the buckle is hard to unfasten (acutally, the tab that holds the end of the strap in place).",negative
"Master Lock has been around for a really long time.  I purchased because of the name, the sturdiness of the lock and the color.  Easy to spot which locker is mine amoungst the dozens, most sporting boring black locks.",negative
"My daughter recieved this purse as a gift and we found it was missing some of the pieces. Since the pieces were sealed in a bag, it was a clearly problem from the manufacturer. When we went to exchange it, we found all of the purses on the shelf were missing at least the mirrors! Pretty bad quality control, if you ask me. We ended up stuck with an incomplete toy... pretty dissapointing.",negative
My niece loves this little purse with all the items that go in it. She walks around caring her little purse just like her mom's.,negative
"My daughter likes this toy, I was disappointed that the little pink phone didn't have push buttons. Other than that the toys is cute.",negative
got for my niece and she had a blast with it. the only bad this is that the little parts all get lost and now she does not have half of them.,negative
"My twin girls got this when they turned two and they both love it and still have it at almost 3 1/2.  My only complaint is the little plastic card holder.  For some reason, neither of the girls can open it.  But overall, they love the purse and it's lasted this long with very destructive twins!",negative
"The baby loves his little Dora bag, but why they can't make some of this stuff in blue or grey or any other color is beyond me.",negative
Hard to beat the price but I didn't expect that Casio still made this bad back lighting for night viewing.  I gave the watch away a day after I got it.,negative
"I thought it would be a bit bigger, but it was not. I'm keeping it anyway, it does the trick. It's also on the small side around my wrists.",negative
this watch should just be for a woman's waist. It is really a small watchactually gave it to my 15 year old Grand-Daughter,negative
"Product came on time, was exactly as described, were the correct size and the correct color. I had no problems with this order. When I was going through the reviews, I noticed quite a few complaints, and was worried. I needed new sneakers and figured 40 bucks was not all that bad for the shoes. I used to wear Chucks until they fell apart, and will probably do the same with these.",negative
"Not black!Like an awful green blackI love converse, but these black ones are just ugly. I don't even want to wear them for they do not match my other black clothes in the closet.Sucks",negative
"I love my black on black converse tennis shoes, straightgangsta! Now this is my style. It goes with any I wearthat's casual or street wear. Thank you.",negative
They were a tad larger than I expected. Not a big deal. We will keep them a little while longer. I appreciate the expeditious shipping.,negative
"Like:Great look.Dislike:This item weights a ton!Tongue moves around.Insole is so flat, I get sore feet after just 10 minutes walking.",negative
"My son only wore these shoes once (he's only 2) because they cause so much distress to get on and off, we just don't bother anymore. Why they dont make a  hidden zip for the toddler sizes is beyond me. They're expensive so wait until they're older before buying this type of shoe.",negative
They are comfy and flat. I did not want to buy specific weightlifting shoes due to price so ended up with these. They perform well while squatting and lunging though they do have a small toe box.,negative
"These shoes run so big, and the size is very confusing. I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size, but they won't do that. I have to send them back, and buy another pair. No thanks.",negative
"One of the very few places that sell these above a size 13 and a few dollars cheaper than buying directly from Converse.These are the real deal, in case there were any concerns!",negative
"I bought these for my daughter who wore her previous Converse into the ground.  She was a little hesitant about the gray color, but likes it now. She gave them 4 stars because she wishes they had arch support.",negative
"Unlike what other reviewers said, this shoe is EXACTLY the correct size. I will say, though, the tag on the inside of the shoe has weird sizing information. for instance, it says that my size 11.5 men's shoes (US) are size 9.5 Mens (US)... I ordered 11.5's and these are, in fact, 11.5... I have no idea why the sizing info on the tag is wrong as these do not appear to be counterfeit shoes.",negative
"I have 10 pairs of Chucks, and I will keep replacing the ones that get so worn out, as these did. Can't go wrong with the classics!",negative
"a little overpriced for the quality. not nearly the quality of Chuck Taylor Converse from the past, undoubtedly from being made in Indonesia.",negative
"These are a vibrant pink and I get lots of compliments!  As usual, Converse run a half size too large and no support.",negative
"call me crazy, call me weird, call me what you want. A girl in chuck taylors is a girl in my heart. high heels schmigh heels. chucks are where its at. The low key throw em on and classic style you see everyone wear. The first of many for my girlfriend, she will have about 13 different colors ^__^",negative
"My... 10th pair of cons in 10 years.  If you have never owned a pair of Cons, they will last about a year of regular use.  They are not good in bad weather.  They do not have any arch support or cushioning on the sole.  They are not waterproof.  They have poor traction.  That being said, I love them just the way they are.",negative
"What a releif this bra is for me.  I can run, jump rope, and perform other aerobic athletic activities without a hint of a jiggle!  This is a muist have for the active well-endowed!",negative
"I closely studied the strange sizing chart for this bra, and ordered a size 3 a few months ago.  This turned out to be too big, so I ordered a size 2.  The size 2 was way too small!  I am about a 38F; the 3 had too much room while the 2 didn't even fit around me.  This gap in sizing has me confused but maybe when I lose some weight I will decide to try this bra again.",negative
"I have 40/38 DD size breasts but I love to run. :-( THis bra has been my go to bra when running, doing HIIT and Turbo Fire. I've tried other bras such as the Panache and to double bra other bras but nothing compares. My ONLY gripe is that it's not adjustable and at 64 bucks a bra that sucks especially if you're losing weight because you'll have to spend more money on a smaller bra. Get this bra if you're looking for maximum support. I'm actually going to buy another one because I don't want to have only one.",negative
"again, i bought this based on a recommendation of a friend, i absolutely hated the fabric it was a cheezy almost las vegas type shiny fabric, ugh also the straps were too short. i couldnt fit it right. did not like the front closure either,, you need a whole day just to get the thing on!dumb design in my eyes, i sent it back,",negative
"I bought this bra not with sports in mind.  This is not a 'pretty, feminine' bra. As a large busted woman, I was tired of being disappointed with ill fitting bras. I needed the back/posture support and ample coverage.  This bra provides both--however the drawbacks are: 1)the straps are not long enough for me and 2) It gives you that 'minimizer bra' look. Nice wide straps and it provides cleavage coverage.  You may want to wear a tank or camisole with lower/open neck tops.",negative
I don't like Ameribags because they are too hard to store things in and find things in. I do not like their bag.,negative
the ring is pretty but just a little to flashy for me the band is not made for small hands,negative
"This is a very useful bag and is as described. The only caveat is the leather - it's rather stiff and not very good quality. That said, it's a bargain for the price.",negative
It's not what I expected and it is to small. I will be giving them as gifts instead. Thank you!,negative
"I like the looks of this wallet and especially the color, and all the spaces for cards and your license.  The only thing I had a problem with was the slots for your cards were hard to use. I had alot trouble pulling my cards out, I do like the wallet so I'm going to keep it and hope they will stretch out a little in time.",negative
I didn't like the way the credit card sleeves were laid out and there was no zippered compartment.  It was also slightly ugly.  I sent it back.,negative
The card slots in the wallet are too tight.  You have to force the cards into the slots and then they are almost impossible to get out.  I used the wallet less than a month and the sides were already tearing away.  I've gone back to by old wallet.,negative
I'm usually a fan of playtex but this one just didn't cut it for me.  I had to return it because it was so uncomfortable on me.  There was no problem with the return.  I appreciate that.,negative
"I am a 38D in all bras, Victoria Secret, Playtex, Beyond Bare, but this one is way tooooooo tight.  The cups are also a little too small, and yes, as another reviewer mentioned, I also feel like I looked like torpedo chest too.  I would not recommend. I love Playtex bras but they made a mistake with this one.",negative
"Bought a 40DDD. This bra is offensively ugly and clumsy. It has a lot of padding which makes my already large breasts look enormous, The cups are moulded and - of course since it's Playtex - they are pointy. I was stunned at how horrible it looked on. Add to that the fact that the underwire and band are very uncomfortable; they don't lie flat against your body, yet they chafe and rub. I've learned my lesson now. I'll never buy Playtex again.",negative
"This slip is not gorgeous or luxurious, it is just okay. I wear them as nightgowns or around the house in the summer. One of the straps consistently twists around the hook which is annoying and keeps me from wearing it as often as I would otherwise. At least it was inexpensive but you get what you pay for, especially in this case.",negative
"Needed another slip for a trapeze dress and this worked. I wear a 22 and its a bit snug.  Other than that, it works.",negative
"Had to return.  Will have to find a place that sells full-size slips to try on.  Don't use Victoria's Secret, they are way expensive.",negative
The pink color was very faint - almost white. The quality on these was a little disappointing as well. The little pad in the middle was way off-center on almost every one. They didn't stick as well as other brands i've tried as well. Would not buy again.,negative
"They serve their purpose to keep bra straps on the shoulders. They were what I expected them to be, period.",negative
I can understand why this affordable nightgown received positive reviews but it is too thin to wear outside of the bedroom in my opinion.,negative
"Truly terrible.  I purchased two of the three packs and upon opening one package I discovered that they were full of pulls that would lead to runs during/after first use.  Next I tried on another pair only to discover that whilst the length of the stocking was fine the spandex/elastic was so weak that they almost immediately fell down even though they fit.  Also, I found them to be very sheer.  I thought that by purchasing the 'fantasy black' that they would be more like tights in color but that was not the case.  Overall, very unhappy with this product and will be returning for a full refund.",negative
"At the moment, I can only wear nylons on one leg.The other foot is still wrapped from surgery and will befor another few months.I recommend these stockings even if you can use both.They stay up without garters or garter belts.  No need forpantyhose.  The elastic is firm but not too tight.I may use them when I have the use of both legs.",negative
"I have been on the prowl for thigh highs that do not have the very uncomfortable synthetic material to hold them into place. I thought these were it, but I was wrong - I failed to read the ""Elastic leg bands for stay-put support"" part, but I did not give them 4 stars due to my human error. They received 4 stars because the ""fantasy black"" was hella black, barely sheer. Maybe the ""off black"" would have provided the sheerness I was looking for.I thought about keeping them any way, but I finally found what I believe to be a pair of Berkshire thigh highs with lace and without thigh choking rubber involved so I'm sending these Sheer Thigh Highs back. If these are the kind of thigh highs you are in the market for, I suggest ordering a size up because my thighs are small - I'm 5'4"", 120 lbs - and the C-D still dug in enough to create that unsightly bulge at the top. I believe if they were one size larger, they would still stay in place and be flattering and somewhat comfortable at the same time.",negative
"Wow...I should have listened to the other reviews. While it looks comfortable-- it isn't. The edges alone are scratchy and the torpedo look I could move past as I've had one other bra do that to me in the past, but after some time it worked itself out. I'd have ignored it completely if not for the scratchy feeling at the hem lines. There for it's being immediately returned.",negative
"I have bought Bali bras before and have not had problems with them.  Had under wire bras quite a few times and didn't have problem with them either.  Have worn 1 twice and I was at work and I had to cut out the under wire is was so uncomfortable.  I will be returning the other 3 that I bought.  If I was smaller they probably would be alright, but being on the heavier side when I sit down there is not enough padding on the bottom of the bra to protect the mid-section.",negative
I was disappointed when I could no longer find them at my local stores.  Thank goodness I found them here.  The price was quite reasonable too.,negative
"This bra has no padding.  It is stiff and a wee bit scratchy until washed with Woolite or similar cold water soap.It is a minimizer.  And it works.  For those tops that are tight. This works!MY BALI INDULGENCE 34 DD AND 36 DD.  I CAN SLEEP IN.  This is not sleeping comfort.  This is for minimizing.The price is super.  My other Bali, and Olga bras cost $55.00 to $60.00 dollars.",negative
"I usually wear Lilyette Minimizer bras, but now they do not even make the one I really like.  So I decided to try the Bali Minimizer, but although it fits, it does not minimize like the Lilyette does.",negative
"It fits not too bad, but I did need just another cup size bigger. I thought I ordered triple D and that is what this says, but the bras say double D. I took the wire out, because it was pressing into my chest to hard, but the bra is comfortable. If I had the right size, I still would have taken the wire out.",negative
"First off it fits way too small. I bought it because I was under the influence that it would fit a plus sized woman like me perfectly. Don't be fooled by that! This bra is not for plus sized women with larger busts. It looks nothing like the one in the picture. The under wires are so uncomfortable. I always buy under wire bras and this one felt like it was poking me to death and digging in under my breasts. The front of the bra sticks up and out (the under wire) right between the cleavage and it is very visible under any top. Getting it on was no picnic. I can usually reach back and snap it shut but this one refused as it felt too short. I had to turn it around and snap it then turn it back. It was horrible and too tight. I tried to adjust the straps and that helped a bit but still my breasts were sticking out (muffin top). Nothing I did worked. All I keep thinking is that there is a reason they show these bras on skinny people in the pictures.If you do buy this bra buy it 3 sizes bigger than your normal size otherwise you will be disappointed like I am. The price for this bra is too high. The materiel is horrible and stiff, no softness to it.",negative
Triple D is too small so I tried G...and still my girls are trying to escape....I hate that.  I bought the Goddess plunge in the same size and it fits great.  This is a quality product...just wish sizes were universal,negative
"This is the only minimizer bra I have found that supports me well.  I tried another,more expensive brand at one time, but came back to the Bali. I discovered with the other bra, my breasts were always sagging and spilling over.  I wear a 34DDD.  If I don't have a good bra my back suffers, not to mention the fit of the clothes.  The Bali provides both.",negative
"For the person who is hoping for a dark blue or dark green gown, I have the dark blue gown, it was the very first one I bought about 10 years ago and also I have the dark green. Those are two of my favorites and since it is an old color, they are not likely to be reissued. I just thought I would let you know. Sorry.",negative
"It's difficult to put the bra on once you have these on the straps. Either I maneuver myself into the bra after attaching this, or I just get my husband to do it for me. Both ways are annoying, but hey they get the job done. No falling straps!",negative
"This is too expensive for the cheap quality of this product! Because the plastic is so slippery, when you put it on the back of your bra and attempt to adjust it to your liking, as soon as you begin to raise your bra straps onto your shoulders, the little adjustment clip will slip/revert back to the starting point of where you begin when you tried to adjust it. I can see this happening if I were over weight and/or had large breast, but Im a size 8 and a B cup so this shows you how defunct this product is. Furthermore, the company I bought this from here on Amazon (i.e. Lady Grace) has an outrageous shipping cost! This piece of crap should be half the cost to ship but the company charges an unreasonable shipping fee because they make you pay for them to mail you their unwelcomed catalog (along with this cheap gadget) which I threw in the recycling bin as soon as I got it. Total waste :-(",negative
"At first, I could &#34;feel&#34; them on my back, but after a little while, as I wore them, I not only forgot about them, but I forgot about the bra straps that I used to pull back up on my shoulders every few minutes.",negative
No stretch at all. Are like nylons from the forties. Give me elephant leg or flat out fell down. I threw them away.,negative
I thought the further up the size alphabet the larger they get I was wrong they also need to put the proper size chart along with the product.,negative
"they are a little darker than nude, but they are exactly what I expected. comfy panty hose, hopefully they last",negative
I bought these for my Mother who is short with heavy thighs. The fit was a little small and she found that getting them over her thighs comfortably was difficult.,negative
Finding a 32D in a retail store is impossible. Ordered online and the cup fit is a little off. The underwire is a little small and the cup itself is a little large. I guess I'm just the wrong shape. The 32C underwire seemed to fit the same and the cup was a little small. So I guess I'm inbetween.,negative
"I was so excited for this bra and when I got the 38D  the wire part fit great and actually supported ALL of my boob instead of cutting in too close on the sides.  The cups were just a TAD too big, and I could have gotten it tailored I suppose but I returned them for a 38C hoping that, being a 38, the underwire would still be wide enough too include all my bits but have correct cup size....cup size was alright, but the underwire was too narrow AND the underwire that came up between the boobs was too wide!  It was like pulling my boobs apart from the center!  No thanks!  Plus, it pushed really hard into my sternum!  The material was super scratchy and uncomfortable, I just wished this worked out b/c from the picture it looks so pretty but the material is awful.",negative
"Unfortunately, I ordered the incorrect (too large) size, so I really can't speak to it. I am not saying anything negative; the wrong size was my error. I returned the bra. If there were a way to choose NO STARS, that is what I would do.",negative
"The fit is terrible.  The narrow straps cut into my shoulders, but if they are loosened, the cups don't provide the proper amount of support.  You must be the exact right size to wear this bra...comfortably.",negative
"I've had mine for a year and here's what we got. It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen. My one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks.Wayne",negative
The cable is very wobbly and sometimes disconnects itself.The price is completely unfair and only works with the Nook HD and HD+,negative
"This wall mount does everything it's supposed to do.  The piece that attaches to the wall isn't overly long, which made it easier to mount the arm in the tight space I needed to mount it in.  The only issues I saw was that the joints were VERY tight initially and as we moved the arm around to install it, the joints loosened up to the point where I had to take the included allen wrench and tighten them up again.",negative
"Didn't think it would work as well as it has,because the metal was a lighter guage thanwe expected, but it hardly deflected from theweight of the TV, even extended straight out.",negative
"For the price, you can't beat it. Mine didn't come with any of the screws for the TV, but luckily I had some leftover from another mount so I didn't want to bother returning it. Also, not sure what they mean by tilt, but mine doesn't. The arm extends in and out as said, tv swivels left to right, but does not tilt up and down as was my expectation. Otherwise, can't beat it for the price as in Target/Best Buy etc., these are going for $60+.",negative
"I live in a studio condo and I needed something to rotate to see from my bed and my couch on the other side of the main room. Once you figure out which instructions to use (several varieties are included to accommodate different scenarios and tvs), they are pretty thorough. Don't be afraid to tighten specific &#34;joints&#34; and loosen others to get it how you want it.Originally had bought a different one, and be careful of this, but it didn't didn't have near the amount of swing as this one does.",negative
Just to know that the TV will sit off center of where the base is placed. Other than that it has held up and worked.,negative
"Don't have anything to really complain about.  EXCEPT there doesn't seem to be a way, or i'm missing it to tilt the TV up or down (ie. mounted high on the wall and pointed down towards the chair).  and i am quite savvy with tools/assembly/etc. And it is difficult to get to the bolt heads on the back of the TV to adjust the angle.  No reason to not buy it though.",negative
"Bought the mount for my 30&#34; Dell U3011 monitor.  It fits the Dell quite well, and I bought it for it's reach from the wall, it's ability to manipulate, and it's weight capacity.  And in all those respects, I'm quite happy.However, there is a noticeable tilt/sag to the monitor when I have the arm extended.  I'm not so concerned with sag perpendicular to the wall, as that was expected, but the rotational sag that I sometimes get.",negative
"Bought NEW but I could tell right away that mine had been repackaged and refurbished.  Plus the was missing the 4 arms but had some other random hardware included.

"I have this mounted on my wall in my editing studio.  It holds a 27"" LCD monitor (about 20-25lbs).  It's been up for a week and I don't expect that it will fall down anytime soon.",negative
"It is a solid mount and I doubt that it will ever fail to hold the 22"" LED TV that is mounted on it.  My only complaint is that the bolt that attaches the arm to the wall plate is smaller then the hole in the wall plate so when the TV is anything other than parallel to the wall it leans (up to 1.25"" from one side of the TV to the other ~16"") but for the price I can live with that.",negative
"its a little flimsy and not the easiest to put together, for the price it works.  But for the quality i'd go with Cheetah.",negative
"This item didn't disappoint. It's sturdy, has all the screws included for different flat screen models and yes, it works well.",negative
"Easy to install, with extra hardware for installing your TV. However, my TV had a curved back, so I used the included spacers to space the bars on the back of the TV. I was skeptical of the two lag bolts attaching the bracket to the stud under the drywall, so I added two 5/16&#34; lags, under washers holding the inside edges of the mounting brackets.After installing the Swing Arm wall mount, I grabbed the end of the bracket, fully extended. The bracket didn't sag a bit. I concluded that the supplied two lag bolts would have been sufficient.I've swung my TV out and exercised the various angles available, and found the swing arm not giving a millimeter.I fully recommend this wall mount. I've a few other VideoSecu mounting brackets for wall mounted and floor stand speakers and one for an 80-inch Sharp TV. All are quality products.",negative
"Do not listen to other reviewers, screws that this came with are concrete only, there are no wood or dry wall screws. You will!!!! need a stud finder!!! There are 8 holes in total on a mounting plate, so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud. Sturdy,good looking. There is a whole set of machine screws for(my guess)all TV types plus couple of tools that you will need.",negative
It does the job and it wasn't too hard to install so i'm a happy tv viewer. Nothing bad to say about it. Came with a bunch of bolt options for different make and model TV's,negative

Angry Birds costs 2.99 but is free from Android Market.I bought this Nook because it was root-able... but no longer with the latest update B&N; blocks attempt to root the device.BOO HISS ON B&N.;I never buy anything Apple because of the closed system.  I totally believe in Open architecture for electronic devices.  The closed system ONLY benefits the seller not the user.If all you want is a reader, email and the web.  then hey go for it.  but I truly disappointed and may return it.",negative
"If all you want is a tablet for reading B&N; books and periodicals and maybe playing the occasional cheesy game, this is for you.  Otherwise, pass.This is listed as an Android tablet but it's not.  It's Android on the surface but it can't access Google Play and instead uses the B&N; app store.  This means paying for apps that are free elsewhere.Also, my unit takes an incredibly slow 2 minutes to boot, drops wireless signals that are strong and includes a browser that has the speed of a 90s drug store computer.Wonder where the camera is?  It's at the factory -- there isn't one.  Forget Skype or face to face video chatting.Spend your $200 on a real tablet.By the way, not a slap at Amazon, just the tablet itself.",negative
"If you want an e-reader, get an e-reader - the battery dies in a few hours (or a couple, depending on brightness settings). If you want a tablet, get a tablet. There are far better options for a similar price. If all you want to do is read magazines and buy a few apps, fine. But this thing is truly lacking. I've owned mine for 6 months, and haven't changed my mind about it yet.UPDATE: The product gets even worse with age. It will not fully charge, ever, and at 15% it goes crazy. It runs all sorts of apps, closes them, types things into the browser, and won't let you use the tablet at all. This may not seem like a big deal, but it is unacceptable. 15% should still be enough to read for a bit, rather than going psycho and taking over the device.",negative
my wife was tired of dragging books around she loves the covienence of the tablet and can make the text larger,negative
The price of this tablet I do love.Thats about it.First of all the design of the the tablet feels very cheap.Almost the whole shell of the nook is plastic.Since also the home nook button neing plastic sometimes it gets stuck and makes it hard to push.The format of the homepage I do not like.If you want new wallpaper you have to download a picture file file onto your nook same with music and video.You do get the apps hulu netflix and pandora but thats very limited.Whats also very limited is the app store.What a joke.The apps are all very boring and overpriced.The book are usually never free.The only Up to this tablet it you can watch flash video which is basically the only upside to this piece of junk.Either save up your money for an ipad or or kindle fire.I will be returing my nook!!!!,negative
"Highly disappointed. I purchased the new B/W touch version of the Nook and had intended to use it for lecturing in class when I need to do it from the book. I didn't know that you couldn't download the etextbooks to my Nook from the NookStudy part of Barnes and Nobles. Why would you call this NookStudy if you can't download the textbooks to a Nook reader?Seriously!I could live with the some of the shortfalls for this device (slow touch response, flickering on the screen when changing pages, keyboard mistypes characters, etc), but not being able to download a textbook from something that says ""Nook""Study? Smacks of misrepresentation, somebody should sue. On the NookStudy web page, it says that a ""Nook"" is not required, it should say, ""Not intended for Nook Devices"". Also, it will not load onto any other hand-held device that has the Nook app, only on a PC or a Mac. They should rename it to ""DeskTop Study"", using the Nook label when you can't use it on a Nook device is false advertising (anybody want to sue?).Anyway, I'm returning this and buying a Kindle (at least Amazon will tell you what devices you can install their etextbooks, i.e. almost all their Kindles, Mac, PC and oh, an iPad!).If your planning on buying this for your college bound student, get them a Kindle instead.",negative
"I bought a nook about 8 months ago. I wanted to consider a Kindle but they were not available locally so I was very hesitant to buy one sight-unseen.BN had just released their wifi-only version for $149 which was very reasonable. I bought one from BN with moderate research and minimal hands-on. I have regretted it ever since.Today I said goodbye to my nook library and bought a kindle3. I can't comment on it very much except it is light-years faster than the nook and the interface actually works. I have about 90 books in my nook library, most of which I paid for so I'm a little frustrated.Things that are good about the nook:1. It looks much better than a kindle. While it sits there unused on my nightstand.2. ePub support. I live in Alaska which means it will be another 5 years before our libraries start loaning books via epub so it's not a big deal for me.3. Free Fridays. Every Friday nook owners can download a BN-selected book for free. Most are crappy fantasy/romance books but I have discovered several very good authors that I wouldn't have otherwise.Things that are bad about the nook:1. Awful, awful, awful touch input. I cringe thinking about using my nook with the unwieldy touchscreen. The screen itself is slow to respond, it sometimes registers additional clicks but mostly just ignores them while giving you visual feedback so you wait 5-10 seconds for it to actually do nothing.The touchscreen display is very jerky and difficult to navigate. You navigate the menus by scrolling through them on the touchpad. It will randomly jump to the top or the bottom. It will randomly ignore a touch (there is visual feedback, so it's not a mis-touch). It will randomly click twice on the succeeding menus.Trying to type on the keyboard or use it to look up a word (you need to use arrow keys on the touchpad to scroll a sluggish cursor around the page to pick one) is a test in patience I no longer have patience for. The keys provide visual feedback when pressed. This suggests you can type away merrily until you look at the text field to see only 2 or 3 characters were actually used. You have to type very sloooow and deliberate for the gnomes inside to catch up with you.The touchscreen is the main reason I ditched the nook. It is horribly implemented and makes the entire device borderline unusable.2. Browser. The BN rep sure talked that up. After spending 15 minutes trying to use the browser to register a BN account so I could actually read books I gave up and used my laptop. The browser takes about 30 seconds on average to display a page. It doesn't matter if it's a real page, the mobile version of Facebook or just google search. It will also randomly crash every minute or two. And by crash I mean you will suddenly be returned to the home screen for no apparent reason.Do not buy the nook if you even think you might want to try using it as a browser to check your email while you're sitting in bed reading a book.3. Battery life sucks. Sorry, but it does. I like to read a lot and having to charge it every couple days makes me upset they claim a 14-day battery life on it. I think it gets about 14 hours per charge (minus the 10% when it automatically goes to sleep). There is a persistent charging bug with the nook, or at least with mine; If you have wifi enabled but the device is sleeping (as in just normally leaving wifi on) when you plug it in to charge, the wifi will activate internally as it (I assume) checks with BN for book updates. This stops the charging and it will not resume unless you turn off the wifi and unplug and replug the charging cable.This is very frustrating as you plug the device in and forget to turn off the wifi. The next morning you grab it only to see the cute ""Your battery is too low to operate"" message.4. It weighs about 20% more than the kindle and is noticeably thicker. Not a big deal, but if you're in bed reading with one hand it weighs about as much as a heavier hardcover which means you're switching hands every so often. Heavier does not always mean better.5. Page turns. When I first got the nook it took between 3-5 seconds to turn a page. I would actually press the page turn button when I got to the last paragraph and could finish it before the page turned. A software update has vastly improved the page turn speed (about .5 seconds now) but only when turning the actual book pages. Library pages, shopping and browsing shelves still take 3+ seconds. I have tried a factory reset twice and either my device is defective (BN support did not think so) or it still sucks. This also strongly influences the cursor movement speed when trying to select a word and the speed at which you can enter text.6. Screen readability is acceptable. It looks like the page was printed on a crappy inkjet printer, with pixilation apparent. The kindle is more crisp and darker.7. The included Merrium Webster dictionary is broken. A large number of entries simply do not work. If you search for one of the effected entries the nook performs a search before inexplicably returning you to the book page. I do not remember which letter(s) are affected but it does not appear to be priority for BN to fix.8. Shelves. Shelves are BN's answer to everyone complaining how difficult it is to find books in the library. You can create a custom named shelf and place books on it. It is very clunky and sluggish and expect to spend 30 seconds trying to find your new book and another 15 trying to put it on a shelf. Sometimes it just won't let you put a book on a shelf and you have to restart the nook. This adds another 2 hours because you will be so frustrated by this point you will put the nook down start punching holes in the wall.9. Sometimes books fail to open. This means you have to go back to your library and open the book again. I have no idea why it happens but it happens frequently enough to mention. Once you get a book open and keep reading that book until you're finished it works well enough. But the menus, navigation and overall usefulness is virtually nonexistent.10. It's built on an android platform, which means it's buggy and randomly crashes or stops working. A restart usually solves this, but I keep shouting ""WHY, WHY, WHY"" every time I have to. Although I haven't had to restart it since I got the kindle. This may or may not be a result of not using it any more.Closing thoughts: I would encourage you very strongly to use one before buying it and investing in an e-library only to find yourself in the same situation I found myself. If you really have your heart set on it, buy from a local BN and try it out for a couple weeks so you can return it. I waited for the nook software update that was supposed to fix all these problems. After that seemingly only addressed the page turn speed I was outside of the return period and stuck with this nice-looking nightstand decorum.",negative

"Bought a Nook in September 2010.  Used it solely in my home.  Now, it's February 2011 and it had multiple lines running vertically on the screen.  Customer service is terrible, routes your calls to all the garbage 3rd world countries of the world.  Can't undersand them and they run you through all the tier-1 support questions for an hour.  Still gets you no where.  Finally got a return label but I hear that they send you a refurb item back.  Great.I only bought the Nook over the Kindle because the Nook supports DRM (free downloads from libraries and what not), but Kindle has better controls.  I will find another ereader than supports DRM and eat the cost myself.  Maybe get an extended warranty?",negative
Beware. I bought this used and the person or company I bought it from didn't have the common sense to de-register it from the previous owner. That should be done before you sell it. No excuse.,negative
I ordered this product and it was not what I wanted. I ordered the wrong one. I contacted the company and returned the item with no problems. I ordered and new one from the same company and cannot wait to get it! Thanks!,negative
Not worth saving a few bucks. Go with an iPad.,negative
"I bought this product used from a coworker's daughter who was phenomenally underwhelmed by it. It is heavy and slippery. The capacitive touch is not perfect, and the narrow metal rim of the screen ensures one ends up touching the screen and changing things inadvertently. There is only one option for a page turn; lefties beware. The battery life is far shorter than the time necessary to read a medium length book, and the plug-in is at the bottom of the unit. Since the cable is specific to the NC, I hated to risk bending/breaking it as I can imagine it is pricey to replace so plugging in the unit usually meant it was time to put the unit down for a LONG time while it recharged. I traveled with this unit, and it did not get me from one airport to the next on a charge. A lot of the ebooks I own are in .pdb format, which B&N sells, but the NC does not read. I was having problems with the unit not doing the motion side-turn and read thingy, and B&N pretty well ignored me. The local manager reminded me that used units are no longer subject to help. (The concept of the unit being less than 4 months old when it died, and turned on twice before I bought it, didn't bear any weight.) A local computer repair guy charged me $60 for absolutely no help at all; apparently the NC is far too complicated for anyone but a B&N repair person which never bodes well. Now the unit, fully charged, will not turn on at all; again, no help at the forum. Since for $40 more one can buy a ViewSonic gTablet with 10"" Multi-Touch LCD Screen, Android OS 2.2 and download reading apps for it, I'd say forget the Nook Color.",negative
"I've had the Nook e-reader for less than 18 months. It's been ailing for at least 12 of those months. At first, it wouldn't start up for no apparent reason. I'd get crazy messages and images on the screen, but no access to function. I went online to see if other buyers had the same problems and possibly solutions. They did. Lots of complaints and a few helpful suggestions. The things I had to try were a nuisance but they worked when I was persistent. I learned to fuss around and get the thing started. Then the charger started failing. I'd have to position it a certain way and weight it down when it was attached to the NOOK. That worked for awhile. After awhile, it seemed clear that something was wrong with the connection so I bought a Nook-compatible charger from Amazon. Good news. It worked. Bad news. It worked for only a week. I called Nook Customer Service. They said I really needed a Barnes & Noble brand charger. So I laid out another $15 or so. That charger worked for about 3 days.Now the EEG for my Nook has flat-lined. No web advice and no Customer Service advice helps. However, in my last conversation with B&N;, they told me to take it into a B&N; bookstore and have them look at the device. This will be my last ditch effort. If further measures require an investment of more than 10 cents, I'll tell them to pitch it in recycle.I wouldn't have hung in nearly as long if it hadn't been for a NOOK game I'm addicted to and can get nowhere else. Time for online-game-rehab, I guess. I will never buy another Nook. As my kids would say, it's a P**** Of S***.Barbara Cox",negative
"When rooted, this is an amazing device, with a powerful CPU that can be over clocked past the normal over clock speed of 1300 Mhz and way past the typical 800 Mhz speed with only less of a battery life and no other ill effects. You will have to download the typical angry birds and fruit ninja games as apk files, but when you do, this device will shine. Other recommendations are tank hero, and Jet Car, and Jest Car Lite (the Lite version has levels that the full version does not even have!).",negative
"A decent color e-reader, but pretty much worthless for internet use. The thing will only connect in the B&N store. Apparently it's extremely finicky about the wi-fi hub that it will connect to; meaning most wi-fi hotspots will not work. There's lots of online discussion of this defect in the color's design. I bought mine last summer. And now you have the option of the Kindle Fire. But I've just been reading that some of its new owners are having trouble with wi-fi, too. So, apparently there's no free wi-fi lunch with these relatively inexpensive Android e readers.",negative
"Yesterday I spent over an hour playing with a real Nookcolor at my local B&N;, where I've befriended the staff as I go there almost every day as an unemployed.  Anyway, I was very dissapointed at this iteration of the Nook.First off, the Nookcolor is very heavy.  I think it's almost 1 pound, and since it's not a true tablet, you're supposed to hold it in one hand, but it'll strain your hand muscles after a few minutes.  Even the B&N; guy told me to hold it with TWO hands. That's pretty pathetic, I must say. The only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support, which obviously is not convenient for a device that's primarily an e-book reader.Second, even though it's much faster than 1st- and 2nd-generation Nooks, it is still slow, especially when browsing the web.  Now, page turns are generally faster, but there is no animation, and sometimes there *is* a slight delay so you're never sure if the device registered your turn gesture.  Very annoying.Third, the screen is high-res but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles.  I think the resolution is 1024x600, and the DPI is in the high 100's, but overall I felt the screen looked coarse.  I guess for this price, they have to pick some cheapo screen, so no surprise there.  The color LCD screen, of course, draws down battery pretty quick, a fact even the B&N; staff acknowledges readily.  Also, the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlight.Speaking of the screen, the digitizer is not very responsive, whether you want to zoom in or out or type something.  It's slightly better than my 4th-gen iPod touch but that's still a very frustrating experience.Fourth, the software is still buggy.  The demo unit in store had a few books, but half of them could not open, with some mysterious error message.  The web browser could not render several web sites I tried.Fifth, the interface is very confusing.  There is the hard nook button, there is some kind of drawer button on the screen.  After an hour I still found myself tapping the wrong button to do something.  Very dumb.Sixth, of course, you cannot access the Android Marketplace app store, at least without jailbreaking this.  Very few apps are available and there is no indication B&N; will allow more aps, since they wnat to use this sell e-books, which carry fat margins and have super-enriched Amazon and its founder.In short, this is a disappointing device, not the least because its hefty weight and barely useable screen are just ridiculous for an e-book reader.The list price is $249.99 and B&N; does offer a 30-day money back guarantee if you buy it from them.",negative

I am now forced to report it to my credit card company and hopefully they can get some where with them.  Buyer beware where you buy your Nook touch.,negative
"Unboxed the Nook. Charged it up. Won't connect to my Wifi network when three laptops in my house will. And it won't work at all until you register it. Posts on the Internet say its a complex technical issue. I'm calling the B&N; tech people. If they can't fix it fast then this thing is going back. I didn't sign up for hours of struggling with Nook's technical problems. I have better things to do.Update: Customer service didn't help. Took it to Barnes & Nooble Store but the battery had drained in less then a week so they couldn't look at it. I figured if the battery can't hold a charge for that long than I didn't want the device. The seller agreed to take it back for a restocking fee and I had to pay for shipping. This thing cost me time and money, a bad experience all  around. I'll never buy a B & N product again, certainly not from a third party seller.  I've ordered a Sony reader directly from Sony. Hopefully I'll have better luck",negative

"No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service.  I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",negative
"Received this as a gift last Christmas (11 months ago). Manual claims that at a typical rate of reading, one should be able to use it for a month on one charge. My battery already lasts only 2 - 2 1/2 hrs on one charge before the unit won't start due to a low battery level, requiring recharging. This is either a false claim on the part of B & N or else the batteries they use are of exceedingly poor quality. I've used hundreds of rechargeable batteries of various brands and technologies over the years; if this thing suffers from a battery problem, then the batteries in these devices are on par with the cheapest quality / lemon nicad rechargeables I use to encounter 25 years ago.

"When attempting to live chat with their customer service, I was ignored 3 times where the other agent never responded and then the chat timed out, and had the session terminated 3 times for some unknown reason right after their standard ""it's not really broken"" response was written.

Maybe I was just really unlucky and the person I talked to was angry or planning on quitting or something, but I still find it unacceptable.Seriously, go with a kindle or something else instead. Amazon's customer service has always been well above average for me.",negative

"A very easy replacement for a 5th gen ipod 30G HD.  I purchased the ipod on ebay knowing it was damaged.  It had the ""sad ipod face"" screen of death.  I could hear the HD trying to spin up, but not reading properly.  If you have that indication, all you need is this HD!The repair was easy.  Carefully pry apart the ipod with a small flat screwdriver and remove the smaller connector.  The ipod can now be placed on a table with both pieces open.  Next, remove the bad HD by unplugging the ribbon cable ON THE HD SIDE.  Make sure to note the orientation of the HD as it will only work one way...easy to put the replacement HD in ""backwards"".  Replace with the new HD.  The only trouble I had was the cable would not stay in the HD for some reason.  I had to use a piece of tape to secure the cable to the HD so it wouldn't come out.  Next, using a small pair of needle-nose pliers, grip the small ribbon cable gently, and push it back into it's slot.  Finally, carefully hold the HD in place and re-attach the two ipod pieces.Now you will have to restore to factory settings.  There are resources on the net for this...I just started up iTunes and plugged in the ipod.  After a few min. iTunes reconized that the ipod needed to be restored.Good luck!",negative

"The Dell Axim X30 624 Mhz was released in 2004. It still has a lot going for it; it's sleek, compact, and attractive, it's got Bluetooth and WiFi, and a 624 Mhz processor (the fastest processor available then). But I can't imagine why anyone would want to buy this outdated model, especially since the price listed here for a brand new unit is higher than what it retailed for in 2004. It uses Windows Mobile 2003 (WM v4), which isn't supported by MS anymore. The current version of Windows Mobile is 6.1.Additionally, Dell has discontinued the Axim X30 since 2007. You will have trouble getting support from Dell if you run into any problems.But complaints about it being outdated aside, the Dell Axim X30 has a few significant problems with it:1) A problem commonly reported is the backup battery going bad or burning out. There is no way to replace it unless you want to venture into cracking the case open and soldering the right kind of battery on.2) A lot of users, like myself, have the problem with the built-in storage spontaneously disappearing. The PPC doesn't ""see"" the drive anymore; it's like it doesn't even exist.3) Activesync frequently fails to sync some task and calendar items.4) Pathetic battery life.

"I used to date this girl who loved Scrabble.  So, by association, I had to as well!  We used to play a lot - even with her Grandmother.  What they did, however, was ""cheat"".  We had one of these - this same Franklin Spelling Corrector you see here (an older model but same nonetheless) and you each of us was allowed to use it to come up with all kinds of crazy words.  I thought this was a dumb way to play Scrabble, at first, but then I came to love it.  If you're all ""cheating"", then it becomes a different game - the strategy changes.  We had a lot of fun.  Too bad I had to dump her for being utterly insane! (I'm sure she was bipolar-scitzophrenic or some variant thereof).  I kept the Franklin Spelling Corrector!  Still have it to this day!",negative

"If you type the wrong word in, it &#34;might&#34; produce the correct word.  It doesn't give any explanation of the meaning or how it can be used. I should have sent it bk., but I factored in the cost of return shipping - wasn't worth the return.",negative
Had my doubts that this would hold a 300 page paper back book because it's kinda thick and therefore stiff... NO Problem and the adjustable part of this holder is that the two parts that actually hold the book swivel so you can move them in or out to accommodate the size of book.... SIMPLE  BIG BOOK or small book it holds them all and the design allows for easy page turning.  I am using it to take notes for study.  Bought a much bigger holder at twice the expense and returned it... could not turn the pages.  This is a winner,negative
"I'm very disappointed in this device. It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides.  The only thing it has going for it is portability.  It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback, it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions.  Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again.  I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them.  For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it.",negative

"This is as described but for some reason, I was still expecting it to be a little larger. I purchased it with the intention of using it when making my daughter's lunch - cutting cheese slices, sandwiches, cucumbers, etc.  It's the perfect size for what I wanted.

Got this for my daughter for Christmas (2 year old) and she loves it.  She's at the age where putting things in to boxes and taking them out can occupy her for some time.

These are OK if you are doing something that has liquid.  I have tried small amounts of hard things and they don't seem to blend or chop without a lot of side scraping.,negative
I bought this item specifically for grinding spices and herbs for indian cooking. It does a fairly decent job with the spices although you need to have at least 1/4 cup for it to work well. As to the herbs perhaps I'm doing something wrong but it did not do as well. The herbs that were above the blade stayed put and it took a lot of scraping the bowl to get them chopped up. An addition of something solid (perhaps an onion or a some butter) would probably take care of the problem but just the leaves on their own give this processor a hard time.,negative
Bought this as a gift for my daughter in law. She has used it a few times and loves it.,negative
"I purchased this in advance for what I knew was going to be a lot of food prep Labor Day Weekend.I was so certain of the Cuisinart brand name that I threw out the boxes and other packaging and the damned thing didn't work.  Well, it worked for 10 seconds and then died.  It was probably the single biggest waste of $30 I have ever made and the entire thing ended up in the trash and I spent 4 hours chopping vegetables by hand.",negative
"I find it a little difficult to get the get the consistency I want.  Some things get liquefied if the chunks are too big and I want to try for a little smaller.  What I wind up with is liquid -- but still with some chunks in it!  That, for me is not too bad; I just wanted it for small amounts where hand slicing/chopping wouldn't do the job.  I have had the Cuisinart Mini-Prep for three-and-a-half years and used it again, tonight, for the first time in two years!  Then I remembered why I had not used it.  The parts have too many small grooves and recesses which just do not wash cleanly -- easily.  After brushing and scrubbing the disassembled parts I find that to get off all the small smears of food I have to resort to Q-Tips to get the numerous little, tight angles and grooves clean.  It's a  hygiene horror!",negative
It works well but is a little smaller than I had expected.  This is my fault and not the fault of the machine,negative
Seems to be a solid blender. I was worried about the negative reviews but after using it myself I am convinced that those were user errors. There is a possibility that the glass jar is not correctly placed on the base which could lead to accelerated wear of the plastic connectors. This should not happen with a bit of care. Only bit of criticism that I have is that the blender could be slightly faster and blend more foamy.,negative
"For this money I didn't expect the glue under the button names to peel up within a week. and I certainly didn't expect the base to cause messy leaks despite repeatedly replacing the gaskets. And now, after less than two years the motor has burned out! Shame on you Cuisinart!",negative
"I'd lower my number of stars, but can't because this is an edit of a previous review.  I had this blender for four years (an admittedly long time, but I used it very rarely).  I noticed after a year or so that there were fine black plastic bits on the base of the blender.  After a few more years of use the plastic mechanism in the base of the unit that spins the blades split in two.My husband and I were going to throw it in the trash, but then felt a wave of guilt about how in our consumeristic culture we never repair things anymore, etc.  So he went online and ordered the broken part for $[...].  When he tried to replace it we realized that an interior screw had become stripped and it was impossible to remove the broken piece.  THEN we threw it in the trash and bought an Osterizer, which doesn't have any plastic moving parts.",negative
This blender sucks! It does not work!  Everything just sits there and I have to use a spoon every few seconds to mix it up.  DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER! It will save you time and a headache you if buy a different one.,negative
I love pink appliances and they are very hard to find.  This blender matches all my other pink appliances and is also a quality product.  I would highly recommend it.,negative
"This blender sounds louder than a jet plane and when you're through holding it together, the food looks the same as when you put it in. IT DOES NOT BLEND! a terrible product. i've been disappointed in this brand name before, but this unblender surpasses even their worst.",negative
"This is a great blender that's gotten a bad rap. I've owned this model for years and it outperforms all others for my specific task: pureeing Progresso's Manhattan Clam Chowder. The ice crushers don't liquefy the clam pieces. The Cuisinart purees their little hearts out. The mechanical construction is still the Achilles heel but if I can get 2-3 years daily service for 59 bucks, I'm good.Btw, Progresso Manhattan Clam Chowder is a watery mess from the can. Once it's throughly blended, like a shrimp bisque, it's a world class soup. I'd put it up against anything in a top restaurant. I've had one can a day for twenty years. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for other Progresso soups (they're already too thick). Another stroke of genius: blending pea soup with vegetable soup, but this only works for mid-price restaurant soups.",negative
"Read other reviews.  The drive on this unit fails.  I probably used this blender only around 10 times over the past year, and now its broken.Do not buy.",negative
"This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry), we did not have ""proof of purchase"" and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer ""service"" again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service.",negative
"I had used this blender for blending &quot;soft&quot; drinks like shakes and smoothies without ice, but after using it ONCE for blending with frozen strawberries, the plastic part that drives the blender mechanism broke.  It's made of a hard plastic and not a softer plastic that has some give to it as many other blenders do.  This is definitely not something I would expect from Cuisinart.  Very disappointed.",negative
"I'd formerly written that I'd sent the base for this blender back to Cuisinart for repairs, not once, but twice, after the plastic gears broke blending *liquids*.  Liquids! Not even thick sauces or heaven forbid ICE -- despite the advertisement of this item as a ""bar blender.""Well, guess what? It broke again, when blending a thin soup.  I'm not going to waste any more money sending this thing back to Cuisinart and will have to think twice about buying appliances from Cuisinart again.",negative
"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart, plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice, repackage the unit, deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again, why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later.",negative
"Unreliable and hard to clean.I took full advantage of the warrantee on this coffeemaker. With a only 6 months of service, the grind mechanism bound and couldn't be removed. Cuisinart replaced under the warrantee (I did have to pay shipping charges!) Less than a year later a repeat performance. Again, I paid shipping and Cuisinart replaced the machine. Well you know what happened!  The third one just went in the trash as the warrantee expired two months ago.The machine was always difficult to clean - so know I am online to look at Melita's!",negative
"I have had one of these for about 10 years.  It is still running.  It still works fine.  But, I will be replacing it soon with an electric machine that is self-contained for a number of reasons.This machine only makes soft serve ice cream.  In order to get the density that we are accustomed to in purchased ice cream the soft serve ice cream has to be dispensed into another container and then frozen for at least an hour, preferably overnight.  Be certain to start with a very cold base ice cream, or the ice cream will not even reach a soft serve state.This machine is not quiet.  It makes much more noise than it would appear capable of generating.In order to be able to make ice cream the freezer compartment needs to be solidly frozen.  How long this takes is dependent on how cold your freezer is inside.  I usually put mine in the night before I plan to use it.  I also make my ice cream base the day before so that it will be completely cold when it enters the ice cream canister.If you plan to add nuts or fruit to your ice cream do this after the base has reach a soft serve state to keep the nuts and fruits from getting broken up to fine, unless that is your intention.If you make ice cream, sherbet, or sorbet infrequently this machine will suit your need.  If you don't currently make ice cream at home and just want to try to make ice cream to determine if a machine will get used, this item would also make sense.  However, if you are an experienced ice cream maker, and expect to use an ice cream maker frequently I would suggest investigating the models that chill the bowl on their own (without you having to put something into your freezer overnight).",negative
"I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock, and was so disappointed I returned it. It made sherbet (milk-based) with no problem at all, but I've really been craving sorbet, and the freezer bucket simply wasn't cold enough to do the job--it chilled my mix, but didn't even turn it to slush before it had warmed... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours, only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up.",negative
"I asked my husband to buy this machine for me for Christmas instead of jewelry, and have no regrets!  I love all the sorbets, ice milks and ice creams that we can make.  It is simple to use, and the results taste great!My only complaint is how loud the machine is.  I can't really let the machine run while we are having dinner unless I put the ice cream maker far away from the kitchen and dining room.  But other than that inconvenience, I can't complain.I would agree with the other reviewers -- use cold ingredients, and start your ice cream as soon as you take the bowl out of the freezer.  I let my bowl freeze for at least two days before using it.  I put it in a plastic bag, and then put a zip-loc bag of ice in the container just to be sure.I have a hard time using all of the egg yolks and heavy cream to make true ""ice cream"" (although a splurge once in awhile isn't a bad thing!).  I try to stick to the lower fat recipes.  You can find endless recipes and ideas on the internet.  I must admit that when in a hurry I just throw together some milk, half and half, real mexican vanilla, sugar, and a pinch of salt (no recipe here, just taste it to your own creaminess and sweetness level) to make ice cream for dessert.  It's like having fresh soft serve.  Yum!If you would like your own ice cream maker, you can't go wrong with this machine!",negative
"This made ice cream fast, but not impressed with the recipe or how the ice cream froze on the sides of the bowl while making it. It was so hard it was the impossible to get out of the bowl. I'm going to try again but seriously thinking of sending it back.",negative
"Lets start by saying I hate gadjets, took me years to buy a food processor. But my sister is on chemo, and I found out she dislikes the taste of commercial ice cream, even the expensive stuff. SO I bought this , and made a batch of strawbeerry, an instant hit.the machine is easy to use,and it arrived in the mail in one day!! I followed all the reviews that said ""chill everything"" be careful not to over fill, it makes a bit of mess, and have nice strawberry ice cream , and the bowl is cold in six hours, so I will make peach tonight.I can see this machine is a winner, sorbet and fresh fruit ice cream, with less sugar and no preservatives will capitvate us all summer.( and four sessions of chemo).oh, I borrowed the ben and jerrys book from the library, and now need a copy, its easy and not confusing at all. I love to cook, but don't need complicated cooking with a sick sister.**** for fathers day I made a 1/2 batch of strawberry ice cream, prechilled the cream mix, added strwberries the last 2 minutes and we had perfect  ice cream out of the mixer.***so PRECHILL THE CREAM BASE, AND ADD FRUIT AT THE LAST SECOND AND DO NOT OVERLOAD THE MACHINE.",negative
"My first reaction is very negative.  If the bowl is to be stored in the freezer in a plastic bag, why doesn't the bowl come in such a bag??My old automatic freezer, pre 1999, came with a very heavy duty bag for such storage.Maybe a gallon ziplock will work???",negative
"I had never known of an ice cream maker that did not require either turning the crank manually until your muscles ached, or plugging it up and listening to the awful whirring, grinding, squawking sound of the electric type. Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise, no mess,  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers, you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts, which is just enough for one starving person, or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web.",negative
My timer finally quit working after FIFTEEN years so I'm ordering another one from Amazon---my Home Depot store doesn't even carry heavy duty grounded timers anymore.  I would recommend this timer to anyone!,negative

"Other reviewers see the same problem as mine.The lower handle has little to hold it on. The single bolt that came with the pot is too small and won't hold on. We were forced into using a 32 thread 1/4"" hex bolt. It held for a year. Now the handle has fallen off, again. Is the bolt the problem? No, it's the threaded receptacle! MAYBE, if I drill out the receiving threaded shank and try to force a 32 thread #10 bolt in.If This doesn't work, I'm avoiding buying another Presto from China.When the pot worked, it did well. A little hard to get the aluminium grooves to hit the slots without a fight.Nope, this cooker is useless. Presto you stink.",negative

"I'd used my old pressure cooker for over 20 years. The Teflon coating was chipping off, and because of safety concerns, I was happy to receive another pressure cooker as a gift. That cooker (the Casa Essentials 5-quart model) only lasted for a few uses. The silicone seal ring lost its ability to form a seal, and the part cost almost as much as the cooker. I decided to upgrade and bought the Presto 4-quart cooker.Within a few uses, the handle became loose, because the screws that hold it on are too small. Every time I use the cooker, I tighten the handle. Next, the safety seal in the lid started seating improperly and allowing steam to escape. So as the pot heats up, I tap on the safety seal to seat it properly.Today when I tapped, the safety seal fell down into the chicken soup, which began spraying out of the hole and all over the kitchen. Not a pleasant event on a morning when I felt a bit under the weather and was looking forward to a bowl of chicken soup for lunch.I fished out the rubber seal and put the soup in a conventional pan to finish cooking. Because of the problem with the handles, I'm not going to replace the seal. I will discard the pan and either buy a good quality pressure cooker or do without one.",negative

"I had purchased a Kuhn-Rikon cooker but it finally failed. I bought this one from Amazon and it works great for one reason: It cannot fail. The old fashioned jiggler weight is fail-proof. Cookers with springs and valves will fail over time-the heat and pressure do damage.My little weight became crusty with water salts, so I bought a new one. No problem.",negative
"I use this to cook mostly my meal consisting of a vegetable & fish mixture.  It works well.  I use 1/2 cup of distilled water (which in my opinion is the bare minimum).  You must always start by adding at least a 1/2 cup of water before adding any vegetables.  My veggies & fish cook in about 2-1/2 to 3 minutes, after which i run cold water over the cooker to cool it down.  The only problem i have had is getting the lid to go on sometimes.  I think it gives me problems if the black rubber gasket inside the lid is not positioned correctly, then it is impossible to get the lid on, probably because the cooker is new to me and needs to be &#34;broken in&#34; a little, especially the lid gasket.  If you have a problem with  the lid not shutting closed, then try rotating the black gasket a little or maybe remove it and turn it over on it's other side.

"I decided to get rid of my old aluminum pressure cooker due to concerns about cooking in aluminum. This one is way nicer, once I figured out the gizmos.",negative
I bought this as a replacement for my 40 year old pressure cooker. This one is stainless steel and has a heavy bottom to prevent sticking. It cooked a chicken in about 20 min. plus heat up and cool down time. It is very simple to use and also inexpensive. I would recommmend this product.,negative
I have a onion allergy so being in control of what goes into my sauces helps me a ton and this little baby gets me into beef stock chicken stock and spaghetti sauces very fast and allergy friendly.The included user guide tells you some basics but pretty much any recipe can be converted to use a pressure cooker and saves a ton of time.,negative
"I didn't realize how small a 4 quart pan is & there isn't room enough in this size to cooka roast, which is what I wanted to do with it. I sent it back.",negative
"High quality pressure cooker.  This pressure cooker is made of heavy gauge steel, and you immediately feel the quality over the cheaper ones.  My wife uses it to make Beef Stew, and pork chops, and everything comes out tender and juicy, with no burning.",negative
"Sadly returning this.  The handles won't stay tight and the screws that hold them are already rusting. Plus hard to get it up to pressure - too much sputtering around the handle for a long time!  I remember my Mother cooking delicious tender meats in her pressure cooker years ago.  But I did not have good results with this one. Followed directions and chicken came out tough.  And - a magnet won't stick to the interior (only the exterior)...so maybe the interior is not stainless steel, but aluminum..which is not what I want to cook my food in. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy.",negative
"I have used pressure cookers for over twenty years, and this is adaquate. the six quart size comes from the height and not the diamater of the bottom. The worst thing about it is that you have to attatch the handle to the lid. It's hard to do and it loosens every time you use it so your constantly tightening it. I wish it had been factory assembled instead of my having to assemble it . I don't have the hand strength go do it right.",negative
You can only fill 2/3 of this 4 quart pressure cooker so you cannot really do any canning unless using very teeny tiny jars and cooking very small portion of food.  I have a 5 quart pressure cook and you cannot put a whole chicken in it. You need at least a 6 to 8 quart cooker to cook a decent meal with meat and vegetables.  I won't recommend buying this pot even if it is cheap.,negative
"I've used a 6-qt. aluminum pressure cooker for years.  It finally bit the dust so I decided to try a stainless steel cooker.  This one is taller, but not as wide, as my previous cooker.  However, it is plenty big to hold a 3-4 pound chicken or roast, which is what I usually cook in it.  So far I really like it - and no problems yet with hardware rusting like I've read in a few reviews.  I would recommend this one to anyone who needs a not-too-big pressure cooker!",negative
Just what I wanted.....hard to find in stores and the price was good.I like to keep extras on hand because without them the vacuum is useless.,negative
"Well, it's hard to write a review about a vacuum cleaner that you honestly don't love.  My Hoover is a secondary cleaner for the second floor spare bedrooms -I'd never buy a Hoover again, but I suppose it sort of does the job in an less-used area of the house.  The bags are murder to install in the cleaner..",negative
It's basically a small flooring polisher.  It beats doing it on your hands and knees but it's not meant for doing a whole house of hardwoods at one time.,negative
"But have not used it for that....good for camping to put a lot of small items in and to sit on around a campfire and I weigh 220 pounds!  Do not recommend standing on, but a sturdy lightweight organizer for all the small junk you never know where to pack when camping!",negative
"If you are not use to using a large sustaining pedal while playing the piano, it may appear little awkward.",negative
The Hosa XLR cables are affordable and very heavily made.I have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere.I decided to purchase shorter cables and the Hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly.You really will not be disappointed with these.,negative
"I didn't expect this cable to be so thin. It's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable I've used. Not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference. If I had the foresight I'd spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable.  Still, it works and was inexpensive.EDIT: 6 months later and it's dead already.  Wire frayed at the right angle jack.  You get what you pay for.",negative
"These cables have taken a beating the last few months, and have served me well with no problems..Real metal ends, not molded on, with high quality silicone jackets and strain reliefs at the connectors..",negative
"One end was loose, so I tightened it, it keeps coming loose so I had to put a dab of crazy glue on the threads, hope I don't ever have to open the end for repair.",negative
Only complaint is the size which is my fault. If you can buy at least a 15 foot if you plan to use it on stage.,negative
"I'm a pro-cheapo and I hated this thing. They're noisy, and the cables feel really cheap, gummy-like. Drop few more bucks and get something else!",negative
"I own lots of hosa cables they are cheap and quality is there. I've only recieved one bad cable out of around 50 or so. I use a lot of these guys and if they work when you get them, they havn't failed yet.",negative
"The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones, where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire.",negative
Another quality product from Hosa.  Just what I needed for an insert patch from my mixer to EQ.  I always like slightly longer length as I can always zip tie back but hard to stretch!  No noise from this cable!,negative
plugged it in and it works to connect a mono line out to the stereo input on a Lepai amp. not much else I can tell you,negative
"I carry this in my bass gig bag so I can plug my phone into the mono aux-input on the back of my Genz Benz bass head. Handy for rehearsals when the band needs to listen to a track while working out an arrangement (my bass cab is full range fEARful 15/6/1). Before picking this up, I used a couple of cables / adapters to go from stereo 1/8&#34;  to mono 1/4&#34; and it often seemed I never had quite what I needed on hand.",negative
"It's hard not to love a cord that carries electrons all the way to the end. Not sure what, other than complete failure would take stars away.",negative
"exactly what I needed to connect 2 distortion paddles to my amp...do yourself a favor, always order threw Amazon dealers! I placed an order threw onlinecarstereo.com and had to report a scam operation to my credit card co....their customer reviews were terrible, yet I made the mistake of placing n order...right before my eyes they changed their BAD reviews to add good ones....",negative
"As the title says, it works.  The only reason I took off a star is sometimes it gets a little stuck and I have to use some force to get it off the XLR.  But, no issues besides that.",negative
I got 3 of these to plug XLR cables into the 1/4&#34; jacks on my board. I got it because my board only has 6 channels with XLR inputs. None of them work. Perhaps I got the wrong thing?,negative
"I used this on my guitar Tone and Volume pots and it clears up the crackle.Feels a little oily, but gets the job done and you don't have to replacethe potentiometers.",negative
"We bought this Mic and a spare for our son's guitar amp set-up for his mixer. It seems to work fine, and comes with the Mic cord, We decided to go for the model with the on=off switch based on other reviews, and haven't yet been disappointed.",negative
These cables are a little thin compared to hosa and GLS. They picked up a little interference from other equipment as well. Guessing they are lacking some shielding.,negative
"This mic is well made (heavy on the mic-end).  However, I have yet to try it with my multi-track studio.",negative
these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs... an all around tough mic....great for all your needs...I highly recommend them..,negative
"The mic is well made (heavy on the &#34;mic&#34; end), but I have yet to try it with my pop filter and multi-track studio.",negative
"These things are terrible. One wouldn't fit in my soundboard, another wouldn't lock in my mic. Plain and simple....if your looking for crap that doesn't work....buy this.",negative
They are screws. They screw in and hold things. To say that they did less would've gotten the 1 star. I like them.,negative
"My son needed a Capo, expensive at music  shop where he takes lessons.  At Amazon found what he wanted at reasonable price.",negative
"The handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar, and I feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers. It's cheap and easy to use. It'll do the job, but I don't like it.",negative
"The description says the color is gold.  It's not.  More of a greenish yellow, but does what it is intended for.  I think I would stick with the black color though.",negative
"I use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar. Got tired of losing picks in mid jam, digging through pockets, scavenging for another pick. Now it's right there.",negative
"This thing does just what it was supposed to, i use it on my practice bass since i use any type of picks on that, and it does just what it is supposed to",negative
I bought this as a present for my daughter to learn guitar on. She absolutely loves it. Everyone that has played on it over the past few weeks loves it. You can't beat this for the price!!!,negative
"I know, I know, many people hate on this pedal, calling it &#34;stale&#34;, and &#34;generic&#34;. The problem that they have is that they simply haven't found the right settings on the pedal and the amp, because, after all, the settings on both the amp, and the pedal do make a difference. One thing to note is that it is a bit on the quiet side in my opinion. I have a Digitech Bad Monkey, and I set the level on that to 2 so it matches up with the amp. With this pedal, I have to crank the level to make the clean tone the same level as the distorted tone.",negative
"This is a standard on my peral board along witht he Blues Driver.  This little yellow box is the most bang for your buck you are going to find in an Over Drive pedal.  It is tough, sounds like fire, and will serve you well.  For $50 there is seriously no better deal.",negative
"Wanted a way to plug in my BOSS ME70 to save on batteries. Didn't want to drop the money on a BOSS PSA, so I got this one instead which does the same job, just for less money.",negative
In my opinion this is one of the finest pedals to exist. The crybaby is still on my pedalboard and will be for as long as I can foresee.,negative
"I've only been playing ukulele for about 3 years, so I'm new to using a capo.  It seems to hold tight.",negative
"You can never go wrong buying a Kyser capo.  They are made to last and really do what they are designed to do.  The great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so I don't have to have a seperate capo for each.I also have a capo for guitar made by Kyser and I can tell you that works just as well.  You can never go wrong with a Kyser.  Not only that I like the idea that it's an US company.  I've had some cheaper capos and they just don't do the job.  They either don't press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much.  This Kyser will last a long, long time.",negative
"So I bought these because being Dunlop, I trust the brand. I dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky. The only problem I have is, they scare the piss out of me. Its not a ""tighten washer and nut"" situation with what ive normally seen on strap locks. These have pegs that insert. Its so hard for me to trust these, I always have 1 hand gripped firmly on guitar even if just adjusting the amp I clench my guitar. So scared that the little metal balls things will just slip, peg fall out and ruin a $500 guitar. I havnet had a single problem with this system yet, and I never hope that I do. But if it happens there will be an update to this. Good product so far, just wouldn't recommend it. There is too much crap in the world to be worried about, strap locks shouldnt be one of those things.",negative
"The screws are too long for my very thin bodied Gibson SG Classic.  I can not find shorter screws which fall into the pin so that the straplock will work either---the heads are all too large.I believe I used these on my Gibson Les Paul Custom years ago, and they worked perfectly.  Not on my newer SG though--at least with the new screws it comes with.Fender Start appears to take the system well--only time will tell.",negative
"Straplocks have been around for a long time, but now You can use the instrument with a regular strap as well, This dual design sold me on it..Easy to install on the guitar. A little difficult getting the lock mechanism installed on the strap, still only took about ten minutes to do.  The added security of knowing your 1200 dollar bass isn't going to hit the floor makes it very well worth the small cost of this item..",negative
"I like these straplocks, but they were a little tight to get on a Levy's strap.  I did manage to get it on.  However, I found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar.",negative
"My bass had original-equipment Dunlops on it, but they were silver-tone, whereas all my other hardware is gold.  And after 30 years, they looked kind of dirty and tarnished.  So, I knew it was time for a new gold set, and I couldn't be happier with their look and quality.  I have used that other S-brand on other instruments, and really prefer the Dunlops.",negative
"I don't know if this is a common problem, but i have these on both of my basses, and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing, like metal does before it rusts, it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing. The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose, and one time (the first time) i didn't notice and it actually fell out. Notice i still like the product, this was just one of those things i think, so I would still recommend it.",negative
"I'm not very familiar with how pop filters actually work, apart from getting rid of unnecessary peaks when recording. I have noticed an improvement in recording quality with this pop filter on. I don't know how it compares to other pop filters though, but this one seems like it works for me.",negative
Don't even hesitate buying this thing. It's everything you need. It's a pop filter. It clamps on to anything that isn't over about an inch and a half in thickness.It gets the job done. Buy it.,negative
"the thing is that they don't seem to stay! i mean, you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic &#34;arm&#34;, but it doesn't stay where you put it. and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality. but, i think if you're lucky if just might get the job done.",negative
I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed).,negative
"wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless, the screen came out, was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is MUCH better...avoid this!!",negative
"I ordered this product to use for personal recording, and thought...what could possibly go wrong? I ordered it ""New,"" and it definitely shows signs that it not new. First, the package was stapled, that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. Then, to make matters worse, there is a hole in one side of the fabric. When I order something new, I expect it to be new. Based on this product alone, I would not recommend buying from this seller.",negative
What my headline says. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Removes those annoying popping P's out of your recordings. Until you can afford a Sennheiser condenser microphone that has a built in pop filter than you're going to need this. And the price was right too.,negative
"It is a fun little practice amp, and I agree with the praise it gets. The positives have been covered so I'll point out a few (minor) things I don't like.First of all the power button is on the back, which is annoying. The rest of the controls are on top, why do I have to grope around the back to find the most important button. Plus I keep it in a cabinet so I have to pull it out to turn it on and off.Next! I wish they'd just name the settings &#34;clean&#34;, &#34;overdrive&#34;, &#34;distortion&#34;, and so on. JC Clean, Black Panel, Brit combo and R-Fier mean nothing to me.Then there's another minor annoyance that the input is recessed. A 90 degree angle plug won't fit unless you run it around the back.Lastly, the amp is solid and rugged but that means it's heavy. Not heavy like I can't pick it up, just heavy for something called a micro amp.None of these are deal breakers, just things I find annoying. Overall I have to say I prefer my VOX mini 3.",negative
This houses your guitar and I have a couple humidipaks  in there because I live in a northern desert. Not many frills to this bag. It does the job.,negative
"This bag fits my Epiphone Les Paul II electric guitar very well...but no room to spare.  The outside pocket is too small for sheet music, but works for small things like a tuner and short cable.  I prefer a bigger pocket, but aside from that I can't complain.  This gig bag looks really sharp, and has two shoulder straps for convenient carrying.",negative
"This gigbag is a very tight fit for my Epiphone Les Paul. Their is minimal padding, so it is little more than a dust cover. I tossed it aside, and bought a Fender gigbag. The Fender is heavily padded, and gives me some serious protection.",negative
"I'm using them to angle my speakers up in addition to isolating them from the desk surface. Unfortunately, these angle the speakers down by default, so I had to do some cutting and rearranging, but it worked out. If you need to cut these to fit your speakers, try to find something better than scissors, because it's quite hard to cut the foam evenly with them.",negative
"They work as well as any Dunlop pick; they don't crack, which is a big plus if you use the general Fender variety.  I go a little thicker than I would for regular plastic picks, because they get flimsy after a while.  Take note of the price of the picks and the shipping cost - it might be cheaper for you just to go to your nearest music store.",negative
"If you thought a pick is a pick (like I once did long ago) you would probably come to realize that it would be a mistake to assume that position as your playing and playing strength increases in attack and/or complexity.I use the Dunlop Tortex 1.14mm Purples.Early on in my playing I was using thin to medium picks but read in a guitar magazine along with hearing from several friends that a heavy pick is better. Why? After messing about I found that the player is able to fully control the pick and not let the pick interfere with input and attack.  The interference with a thin or medium pick is that it has give, or slackens when attacking hard. With a heavy gauge pick that lack of rigidity or slack is only introduced by the player and not through the picks flexibility.I tried it and liked it and have been using heavy gauge picks since the mid '80's.I like the Dunlops feel, grip, and durability. They hold up for a very long time. How long? I have had some last a few years. They are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durability.My students use them too, I don't demand it, but I do stress the control aspects with picks of different gauges.Highly recommended. You won't be disappointed.",negative
I don't seem to drop these at all as compared to other picks I have used in the past that just seemed to slip....,negative
"I absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks! They are so grippy, I haven't broken a single one yet, they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio, so it's hard to loose them, but I still do. If you have like a child, nephew, niece, sibling, or parent that plays guitar or bass you can't go wrong with getting these for them, or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little Fender picks that break if you strum a chord, and if you are lucky enough not to break them, they just slip out of your hands while you're playing. They are a little thin for rhythm playing however, and I recommend the .88 mm picks for that.",negative
my favorite picks. Can't go wrong with tortex. the only habit I have with picks if just chewing on them and destroying them so I have to buy like a ton of them,negative
"cant go wrong with Dunlop pick, they last and don't break. end up losing them verses breaking. This .38 mm is a bit soft for my liking, will go a size thicker next time~",negative
"yes, i think you should try these.  if you're looking at them, then get them.  they are thin and flexible so i purchased them to develop my pick skills as i was a finger type guy w/o any pick experience.  i don't drop these and get a feel for where the sting is located w/o looking.",negative
"i like these kind of picks because they have some grip to them, normal picks i use slip out of my fingers some times but these dont.if you hate droping your pick while playing,get these.",negative
"I use the 1.5 mm Dunlop Gator Grip for twenty years. The non-slip surface doesn't take long to wear off, but I have a work-around. I've even put them in a vice, and filed new points on them. I prefer an extra heavy pick because there's no delay from pick deflection.",negative
"Looking for picks for bass , this one did not work for me, it is thick and hard, good attack.but only thumb picks work, so i can use my fingers too.",negative
"If you're worried that the 3.0 mm is too big for your guitar, you're probably right.If you don't use a pick for your bass, then you don't want this either.But if you want to pick your bass, this is the plectrum for you!",negative
another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase.,negative
"Using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks. You simply play faster, no matter what level you are. Alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flat-pick drag. Now I only use flat picks for acoustic play when I want to hear the crunch. 24 picks in a pack, is an insane bargain. You pay twice as much in a store.",negative
"I recently bought a few packs of Jazz IIIs and I was shocked.  They don't play at all like what I was expecting.  Under high magnification the edge doesn't look the same as the old Jazz III either, and they don't play the same if you turn them over!!!  What's up with that?I'm sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like Dunlop.  Let's hope this is just a short-term fluke.",negative
I like Dunlop products I used the purple tortex 1.14mm almost exclusively until I met up with this Jazz III.  And now my personal debate continues...  I like a thick pick and this Jazz III is.  I like tortex and this isn't but...I really like the orange color which makes it easy to locate if you drop it.  I rarely and I do mean rarely drop a tortex pick but this nylon might get a bit slick at times.They make 3 or 4 picks in this line with varying degrees of tip pointiness.  I like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tips.This is the new and improved jazz style pick and I am still trying to figure out if I like this or the trad Fender jazz pick.  Or perhaps having a few slightly different picks laying around isn't such a bad idea after all.,negative
"I like Fender Mediums, always have, but, I gotta branch out man.  Not sure about these picks yet.  The feel a little more stiff my usual.  I want them to last longer.  What happened to the days when you carried the same pick around in your pocket for months and played it until it was round?",negative
"I put it on the boom of my mic stand. Tight on some, not on others. I need to put a shim on it for some stands to keep the picks in place.",negative
it does what it says it does.  only complaint is that sponge is very small and in very dry areas it needs to be checked and refilled 2 times a week.,negative
"No spill, no mess. This is one of the easiest to use products for cleaning strings and necks. Just use the fast fret and wipe off with a rag. It will not dry out, and lasts for years. The only thing I don't like is the can will not fit in accessory area of my guitar case and the led has sharp edges, so put it down before using the cleaner.",negative
This stuff will lube up your strings pretty well! The only downside is that it leaves tiny pieces of fuzz on my strings after a few times of use- but it comes with a little cloth that I assume is meant for this little inconvenience.,negative
"This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name, but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret, my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too...",negative
"Seems to work well, though I don't know how long it's supposed to last. I have sweaty hands, and when I'm done I wipe my guitar down with this lil guy and it helps a lot to keep the strings from getting dirty or cruddy.",negative
"The tips of my fingers often get pretty dry and cracked, especially when I've been playing a lot.  The problem, at least for me, is that pieces of the dead skins sometimes catch on guitar strings making slides, bends, and pull-offs less fluid.  A few strokes of GHS makes the fretboard give me a much smoother playing experience.  An alternative would be using Vaseline on my fingers, but that would probably be terrible for my fretboard.  Also, I sometimes use an Emory board to smooth my fingertips which helps, but I'd rather do that as little as possible to keep callouses strong.  GHS allows me to minimize that.",negative
