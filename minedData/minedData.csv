"I bought this through exchange offer. So gave off my lenovo k6 and chose this in exchange.<br>Let me frank, I am so happy with the value amazon gave for my old phone and the price at which I got my brand new vivo y81.Damn sure, no shop could have given a better deal.<br>Can you believe,by seeing the deal which I received,  my spouse(who always stay miles away from online shopping)  was also planning to get his I phone 6 exchanged through amazon!!!<br>Now about vivo y81...very good phone, sound quality is amazing.camera also nice.<br>The whole look of phone is fabulous.<br>The back portion is glossy  and gives a stylish look.<br>Easy to handle as well."

When i contacted Amazon to return it , they said install an app our team will check it. And guess what their team said this is a different phone than you purchased so can&apos;t replace. Don&apos;t buy it ever"

"This is quite a good smartphone if u don&apos;t want too expensive one. I bought this for an Exchange and it&apos;s very nice. 3 GB of RAM is quite good working. Picture quality is nice in daylight, u may see it won&apos;t work as much fine in night dats only things I have found out is a con in this phone.  Although it&apos;s value for money."
"Nice.."
"Simply fast and good at this cost"
"If you&apos;re someone who wants a power packed phone with all the necessary features and that too at an affordable price, then go for it.<br><br>The best thing is the battery. Charge it once and you can use it all day long. The charger is a basic one and not a fast charger.<br><br>The picture quality is good. And the phone is not heavy."

"Today, I got my phone &quot; Vivo Y81&quot;. But it&apos;s strange that it doesn&apos;t contain ear phones in box and it is not mentioned in description also. Ideally it should be present because non android phones are available with earphones .Need to know the reason"

"Good phone but camera is not up to mark.<br>Build quality- 3/5<br>Feature- 4/5<br>Camera- 2/5<br>Overall- 3/5"
"Good phone camera, quality is good as per 5 and 13 mp but the bokeh mode is not so good,  face and fingerprint  is very very fast all other things are good except its resolution is 1520 * 720 pixels which means heigest quality of watching a video is only 720 pixels which is very bad as compared to other phones, means if you used to watch lots of videos and play heavy games like pubg and a selfi addicted then  this phone is not for you. And while playing heavy games like pubg it lag a lot."
"Superb phone unlocking is faster nice camera with bokeh effect and display was aweome notch hd plus display supporting 4k videos, face lock were working perfectly.  No complaints or problems . 4G+4G,dualsim+memorycard,notch display,lightweight,3GB+32GB,fast unlocking system,superbly responding finger lock sensor,awesome facelock responding perfectly on dark, battery was cool, no heating problems,best on gaming,looking &#x1F60E;cool and awesome bokeh mode"
