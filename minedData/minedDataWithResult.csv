"good phone camera, quality is good as per 5 and 13 mp but the bokeh mode is not so good,  face and fingerprint  is very very fast all other things are good except its resolution is 1520 * 720 pixels which means heigest quality of watching a video is only 720 pixels which is very bad as compared to other phones, means if you used to watch lots of videos and play heavy games like pubg and a selfi addicted then  this phone is not for you. and while playing heavy games like pubg it lag a lot.","positive"
