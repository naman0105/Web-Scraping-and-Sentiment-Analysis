"Review"
"Today, I got my phone &quot; Vivo Y81&quot;. But it&apos;s strange that it doesn&apos;t contain ear phones in box and it is not mentioned in description also. Ideally it should be present because non android phones are available with earphones .Need to know the reason"
"The front camera has a very very very poor quality camera... is it a manufactured defect piece???"
"1no phone"
"Items is very pathetic since day one I have face the problem with sim card and Memory card I have raised the complaint against the same.... I hope sort my issue...."
"I purchased  this mobile  Oct 11 2018. Previously  I used Redmi note 4. Compare with this phone,  vivo y 81 keyboard  is worst.  Difficult  to handle  it.  And we can set dual app only for facebook,  instagram,  what&apos;sapp.  Screen only I like.  Bad experience  with this."
"awesome product with low price.you ll get all the feature  as V9.It worth with full screen with low price."
"Very bad phone. 1stly network problems<br>Then hang. Battery problems"
"Phone price so costly..... Against phone fixture"
"Worst phone and service by Amazon. The phone Lags like hell just out of the box. I just installed facebook and WhatsApp on it and it lags heavily. When i contacted Amazon to return it , they said install an app our team will check it. And guess what their team said this is a different phone than you purchased so can&apos;t replace. Don&apos;t buy it ever"
"It tells camera and music phone but the camera quality is very worst. I contacted Vivo customer support and did what they told and didnot resolve camera qulity issue."
