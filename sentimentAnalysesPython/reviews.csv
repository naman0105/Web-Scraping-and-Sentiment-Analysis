"It sounds good but it adds soooo much noise to my pedal board. If that's not a problem, definitely worth the price.",positive,,
"Some things just don't need to change. Some Wah pedals try to tempt you with built in fuzz, eq, or other wacky add-ons but WHY? I'd rather have one pedal that does its job perfectly than a pedal that does a bunch of stuff but sounds less than great. The Crybaby is a great effect to have for any style; everyone from Jack White to Jimmy Hendrix have used some incarnation of this pedal. It's a must have and that's really all there is to say.",positive,,
"I acknowledge that this is a minority opinion - perhaps I just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards.  But while I loved the sound and functionality of this wah-wah pedal, it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable.  I suspected that the potentiameter was shot, so I had that replaced, but the same problems reoccurred.  Like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it.Good product, but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit I had.",positive,,
I keep a capo in each instrument nothing wore than showing up without one. I am using this on my Martin 12-string. The spring holds tight but can easily be adjusted with one hand.,positive,,
Best 12-string capo I have ever used--and that's over decades.  Works easily and flawlessly.  Very well made.  Five Stars,positive,,
This is my 6th Kyser capo.  This one for my new Ovation 12 String CC245 is what I needed.  I always recommend all Kyser Capos.They last forever and do not lose the strong holds.,positive,,
does what is designed to do easy to use seems sturdy should serve me well for years to come ...was not too expensive for such good quality,positive,,
If you play 12 acoustic you gotta get this one.  Just a hair longer on the padded area which is what  you need.  You can tell them from the 6 string version by the ridges being much closer together on this one.,positive,,
"This capo does exactly what it should.  It clamps the strings tight to there is no buzz and it does not change the tune of the guitar when used.  I have 4 Kyser capos, one for each of my guitars and will never buy another brand.",positive,,
"This is for theKyser Banjo/Mandolin CapoThis is one of three capos I use for a ukulele.  It works, and is my second favorite.  I can park it on the headstock of my ukulele, and it is easy to add, move, remove. With the trigger-type release, it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used. It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  I like how the trigger portion sticks upwards, and does not get in the way like myDunlop Trigger Banjo Capo, Black.  My favorite is still the G7th capo.  This is a close second to the G7th.My only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for Amazon Prime.  UPDATE:  I just saw that this capo is eligible for Amazon Prime.  Free shipping for Prime members!!!For the price and quality, this Kyser capo works on a uke. Highly recommended.",positive,,
"works great, stays out of the way... cant ask for much more than that. (and expect to get it) the price was half of what i was locally.",positive,,
It says for a Banjo or a Mandolin but ukulele is the first instrument listed on the box. It is just the right size to clamp over four strings and taking it on/off is really easy.,positive,,
"Costs about 2x as much as some cheap capos, and it's worth every single penny.  THis has a strong clip, yet does not damage my concert or tenor ukulele necks.  It won;t budge once you clip it, and it's low profile.  Made of metal, it should last a lifetime.I took off one star only for one thing: the hand clip portion of this does sometimes get in the way of fretting because it sticks out from the neck quite a ways.  Some other capos, like this oneJim Dunlop 7828 Russell Banjo/Uke Capodoes not have anything that you can hit your hand on when fretting.  Sometimes I try the Kyser on the opposite side, away from me, the player.  But, it seems to still hit my hand on some chords, just different ones.  That said, I can work around it, and it's a lifelong capo of fantastic build and keeps those strings from buzzing at all on all my ukes. If one was to have large hands, as I do not, this interference may be even more of an issue to consider.C ya.  Happy strumming.  Mahalo.",positive,,
"A very strong capo..too strong for bigger instruments, but works good on ukes and mandolins and banjos with not too thick of a neck.  I have several of these capos, one for each instrument.",positive,,
"Bought this for my husbands Mandolin and he loves it, it works great, we swear by Kyser that's all we use on our guitars is Kyser capos, great product, no complaints and the price is worth it.",positive,,
"Works great with my Baritone Ukulele.  Same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo.  Easily fits in my ukulele case, too.",positive,,
It's a very cute little capo. It works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course it's hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are VERY small. But it works.,positive,,
"Although this capo is marked as correct for a mandolin, it only works correctly above the 3rd or 4th fret on my mandolin. Any lower on the fretboard than that and this capo doesn't have enough pressure to work on the 1st or 2nd fret position on my mandolin, even though my mandolin has a fairly low action.I have a number of Kyser capos and very much like the style (I own at least six Kyser guitar capos and use them on all of my guitars from a Taylor 12-String to a Fender American Strat without any problems), but in this case the banjo capo didn't work for what I need. Perhaps the capo sent to me was defective, although I have enough decades of experience with stringed instruments to know that it didn't seem broken, just not up to the task.From feedback others have sent to me it is possible this capo may work for you if you wish to take a chance on it, but I know that I don't have time while on stage to take 20 seconds to set a fussy capo 'just right' to make sure it is holding just right and then hope it doesn't start to buzz on me in the middle of a song. I went with another brand after talking to some bluegrass guys who had better luck with another style of mandolin capo.",positive,,
I use this capo all the time on both instruments. A friend of mine saw it and asked me to order them one also. I did and they love it!,positive,,
"I have several types of capos, this one seems well built.  A little bulky for 5 string banjo especially if you are fingering near it.  I really don't need to change that fast so use it very little, might use more in a performance setting but that is a ways off.",positive,,
It's a good banjo capo.  Inexpensive  and it works well without squeezing the strings out of tune. End of story,positive,,
"I've been using one of these Kyser's for a good while now. I only have one so it usually stays with the mandolin but works just as well for my banjo. If you never used one, it's makes it MUCH easier to change keys although I usually only use it when I'm playing chords, when I solo I like to play with open strings and this makes it a breeze to pop off and put back on. With a little practice you'll be able to do it quickly without having the strings buzz.",positive,,
"This is such a nice bag for the price.  Nicely padded with an ample zip compartment that can hold your snark, capo, or whatever.  There is a handle and a shoulder strap.  Plus, it is reallly a nice looking bag, black with a little white trim in front.",positive,,
"These are the best strap locks in my opinion, good quality, easy to install and remove, secure, and they look good.  All my guitars have these locks on them and I'm very satisfied.",positive,,
"In particular, I favor the Dual Design. Why? If the need arises, it's possible to use a regular strap that doesn't have the button locks installed. I have two of the black ones on a 7 string Ibanez RG7321, and Laguna LE200QBC guitars. I have spare straps for both guitars, and sometimes I lock those spares with the plastic Dunlop discs.I have some older bass guitars with similar Dunlop locks (the standard version), two of which had locks installed in the mid 1990's, and one from 2003 with the gold DD. All three of them have held up with no issues. I didn't need to re-tighten the screws on those guitars until about two years ago. Then again, I don't tour around the world like the metal stalwarts known as ... MetallicA. ;)",positive,,
"yes, if your willing to swap out strap locks with originals these work fine...i did have a problem with drilling new holes into my guitars...but its explained what  size bit to use so wasnt a big problem...i tried not to drill on most of my guitars  some fit without drilling some did not..good luck...good price welll made..",positive,,
"best strap locks ive ever used, dunlop has always had great products.easy to install and i highly recomend them to any bass player",positive,,
Almost dropped my bass on the floor a couple days before i got these bad boys. When I put them on I felt confident that I wouldn't have that issue anymore. It's easier to strap up because of the quick release tab. This should be every bassist/guitarist's best friend.,positive,,
"I tried this model a few years ago, and I never had a problem with them (once I got it installed), but I went back to the Schallers I had on my other instruments.  I thought (and this has been mentioned by others) that it makes the strap stick too far out from the instrument, which I thought looked goofy.  I also didn't particularly care for the push button release, and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge; these have a C clamp, not a nut, so there's no allowance for differing thickness. I also felt safer with the Schallers, which hook onto the end of the guitar strap button and didn't depend on a spring loaded button to keep the parts together.  As I said, I had no real problems with them, so if they look like they'd work for you, great.  As with all replacement strap locks/buttons, you have to make sure the screws are secure in the button holes before you start jumping off of drum risers, dropped out of airplane, or what have you.",positive,,
"I had to actually follow the instructions and drill holes as specified, then it worked like a charm!  Glad I got them, much less hassle tuning up for a gig.",positive,,
These strap locks were easy to install and use right off the bat. You may have to drill deeper holes into your guitar in order to use them. Just follow the instructions and you can easily attach and detach your strap whenever you feel like it.,positive,,
I've tried a few different straplock options and these are the best. Not only do they securely hold the strap to the guitar they also look pretty good. Highly recommend.,positive,,
"Great product, I've use them before and have always thought they were top quality.  They aren't much larger than the originals that came with the guitar and that extra piece of mind is great!  Easy installation without any modification (at least on mine) and they connect/hold very solid.  Just make sure the buttons are all the way in or you could have mishap ;)",positive,,
"they work well. For me, the instalition wasn't that hard, it took me maybe four or five minutes. The screws provided were a bit bigger than my BC Rich Avenge Beast's stock strap system, BUT when you read the directions and lube the screws up with a small amount of bar soap (or wax- i used the bar soap though) the installation becomes easier.Once you put your strap in, its NOT comming out unless you try hard to undo the system, lol.If you need to clean your guitar strap, take off the locking pin and use a flat head screw drive to pop off the retainer clip. Its a quick and harmless way to do it and it may take about a minute or two to undo both strap locks. Its not that hard though and the reward is worth it.",positive,,
"No complaints about this hardware.  Easy to install with patience, easy to use.  The click on/off system securely holds your strap, and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the post.These work like a light switch...on/off, so I'm not sure how you can rate them as poor.  There aren't really any directions, so it takes a little mechanical knowledge (just a little...it's not rocket science) to make them work.Quality metal, secure function, and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts.I've installed these on a 3/4 Hoener, Full Sized Squire Acoustic, and 2 Fender Strat's.",positive,,
"After receiving theDunlop Dual Design Straplok Systemalready installed on my Gibson Standard electric(7.36 lbs.), and liking them, I decided to try installing them on my Gibson Studio electric (7.23 lbs.). Noproblem. Just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly.I had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation. Money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground. Besides safety I also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars. It's a nice convenience. If you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars.If you are not sure if they will work on your brand guitar seek out an online forum and either search thatforum for the answer or join and ask your questions. You've got a pricy piece of wood there and will wantto take care of it properly.What I don't care for, but feel okay with because they work so well, is how big they seem to be. Theydon't get in the way when being used but look almost out of place. That is why I chose Black for mysecond set. Helps keep the product's profile down a bit. Other than that, the product works asadvertised....NOTE: As of June 2014 I have installed two other sets and all are still working as expected. Do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure. After repeated use the screws can come loose and therewill be trouble if this happens. Do NOT use any glue in case you need to swap out the Straploks in thefuture.",positive,,
"Very easy to install, rock solid, and in my opinion, look much better than Schaller locks.Grab a set, you wont be disappointed.",positive,,
"This product is a must.  Why?..... because it makes strap install and removal so simple and reliable,...and when the strap is clipped into place it is secure.  I've owned numerous Straplok systems on the various bass guitars I've owned, and would not ever own an instrument without installing this system.",positive,,
"I have two sets of these for my straps.  The push button action is most convenient vs. fighting stubborn leather openings, especially if new.  The gold finish matches my instrument's hardware and they are sturdy and durable.  Works for me!",positive,,
"It's worth a few extra dollars and a little extra time to install these. It sure beats fixing a cracked neck, headstock, or guitar body after a guitar slips off the strap pins and falls for a great height!",positive,,
"Oh Yeah, Love this item, sleek looking and very easy to maintain, would definitely buy again for next strap, thank you Jim Dunlop.",positive,,
"I have had these on a Les Paul for years and just purchased some more for the rest of my guitars.  Does what it says it will do - keeps your strap locked on.  I have had zero issues with these.  The installation takes 2 minutes, and has stood up to countless hours of play.  Highly recommended!",positive,,
"these dunlop straploks are amazing! never had them fail on me, and always gave me a good piece of mind knowing that my guitar is safe from hitting the floor on stage or at home, they stay secure when done properly, I've looked at other strap locks and tried some others but the dunlop ones just seem to work, and work well.",positive,,
Very high quality they look as nice as my Fender originals .  Make sure to take your time installing them correctly and consider using a quality wood glue / adhesive during installation.  You want to make sure they can be removed at a later date without damaging the guitar .,positive,,
"i've had these straplocks for a few years now and they haven't failed me once! i love them, and i never have to worry about my guitars getting damaged from a strap falling off or so. they rotate in full circles, and are super durable. you should buy them for all your guitars, and you'll never have to worry again. they are also very easy to use, and &#34;install&#34;.",positive,,
This is the first time I've used the Dunlop Straploks system.  I've always used the competition.  These work just as well.  I guess you just have to make sure you lube the little ball bearings once in a while.,positive,,
"What's great about the Dunlop design:They work!  The only thing you need to do is ensure you've got them engaged properly at the time you attach your strap onto your guitar i.e. just make sure you established a solid connection then go ahead and gig your rear-end off without worry.The design encorporates bearings that allow the strap to freely move around/rotate on the post, which is exactly what you want.  The schaller ones (see below) have a major flaw in them from my family's experience.  We will never run anything other than this design going forward.What doesn't work with the Schaller Design:Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist have been using Shaller-style locks for a while now.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend. The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.",positive,,
"I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops, and boy am I amazed!  Every straplock system I've used in the past, on friends' guitars, semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim.  In contrast, these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it's great!  Better still, the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes, making installation trivial.  And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch, using the posts like the OEM ones.  This is a great system, and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar.",positive,,
I use these on my basses and they do the job quite well.. They are easy to install on the bass and the strap.,positive,,
These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG. All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars. I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out. Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place. Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:1- Bulky. They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers, which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.For a few bucks more I'll stick with Schaller's. I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail.,positive,
"I've been using the same Straploks on all my guitars for the past 10+ years.  I have not had one fail on me ever.  Just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure it's on right.  I've struggled with the C clip in the past, but what are you going to do?  It's a one time thing when you first install, so it's no biggie.",positive,,
"I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, here's what I recommend:Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1"" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesn't need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!",positive,,
"The very first thing I noticed about the design is how far from the guitar's surface the strap is actually connected.  What this tells me is there is considerable added stress to the screw and the wood surrounding it because of the added leverage to the guitar's weight.  The &#34;fulcrum&#34; is the surface of the wood, if this makes sense, and I can't help but wonder if it could eventually (eventually over much time and use) cause cracks or splits as a result.I found someone selling only the Dunlop strap buttons, which is a great idea for someone with 2 main straps and several guitars, and was about to order them when I found Planet Waves Elliptical End Pins.  I think this is the best idea yet for keeping a guitar on a strap, unless you're going to be spinning the guitar around your shoulders, and no additional stress on the guitar's body.  I've ordered a set.",positive,,
"Sorry, I don't like these as they're just too big. They stand out too much. They do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced. There are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap.  Again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant. I also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like I should be wearing big purple platforms when I play. Not cool.",positive,,
"Quick snap on and off. Sturdy.  If it is not convenient, it won't be used.  In this case, it is very convenient and easy to use, hence, your prized guitar will not drop to the floor by accident.  Well worth the money spent!",positive,,
"I agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy.  I purchased a set of these strap locks years ago, and I dont recall having this issue, so I'm thinking that Dunlop changed the screws at some point.  I was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle, and the locks are secure.  However, due to this issue, I'm considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks.  I hope Dunlop fixes this issue soon.",positive,,
"The Dunlop Dual Design Straplock System is a sturdy, fairly easy-to-assemble and easy-to-install alternative to guitar straps slipping off of instruments.  The screws that are used to attach the Straplok to the guitar are heavy gauge and pretty large--there's little chance that these are going to come out.  The locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance.  The only disadvantage of the Dunlop system to Schaller's system is that the the Dunlop sticks out measurably farther from the guitar's body.  Ordinarily, it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences.  On an instrument such as a Hofner ""violin"" bass, though, or any guitar with a strap button on the back of the instrument, this makes it difficult to hold the body of the instrument against your body for support.  Schaller's strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players.  The Dunlop Straplok System is sturdy, should provide a long life of service, and can be found at a better price than several of its competitors.  Recommended for most guitar body styles",positive,,
"Installed on two guitars and I love them! I can switch out many different guitar straps without worrying that they will fall off. Great product, would recommend to any guitar player!",positive,,
These are great.  I have these on all my guitars.  Only problem is the clip on install to the strap.  If you can't get it done google for install videos which will show you how to use a pliers to push the clip into place.  Once installed you are good for life.,positive,,
"I know this is a great product.  I've had a set before.  I have to knock off a star because a part was lost during shipping that renders the product useless.  The product comes in a clam shell package.  For me it shipped with some heavier stuff that impacted the package and let it open some.  There are two retaining clips that slipped out and since the main shipping box wasn't fully taped up one slipped completely out of the box and is probably on the floor of some warehouse or truck somewhere.  I found the rest of the small parts in the box and the larger parts still in the clam shell package but without the one retaining clip the system is useless.The product is too inexpensive to bother with a return.  If I find a retaining clip that will work (I do have one to compare with) then I can use it.That said, I'll say again, the Straplok System is a great product.  I know, I've owned another set for more than twenty years!",positive,,
"A little story to back these lock's integrity.  I installed them on a Korean made Washburn WG-587v.  Incredible guitar after tweaking.  I did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying.  The strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder.  The screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar!  The screw tore through about a half inch of solid wood (and I epoxy all my screws in) before the strap lock broke.  Amazing.Nice, tough hardware.  The only complaint I have is that you must use screws with small heads if you choose not to use the stock screws provided.  Easy to install, just unscrew your stock strap holder and screw in the lock holder.  Attach the lock to your strap and BAM quick release system.  Fast to take on and off of your guitar.I would suggest getting a tough, thick leather strap with a nice reinforced eye to install the quick release button in, cheap lightweight straps will eventually start to tear.  Also, the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps.I have now switched over to DiMarzio clip lock straps instead of the leather straps with Dunlop locks for many reasons and I am very happy, but this product is GRADE A! I always felt 100% secure with these straplocks.  Our bass player uses some expensive (and heavy) Fender basses and he loves these strap locks.",positive,,
"I've been using these straplocks for over 10 years now and never had a guitar or bass break free on me either live or in the studio...they simply work and cost next to nothing to boot. Folks, this is the best insurance you can buy for protecting you precious instrument from popping off of you strap, even if you do some serious gymnastics on stage it's not going anywhere. This is a must have, just buy it!",positive,,
"I'm in love with the dual design system! It works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly. There is one downside to this system, as the strap that is used will be fairly far away from the guitar itself. Which might not be a bad thing considering wear and tear on the guitar from the strap. There was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time. One component, which was this thin but big washer was pretty hard to install and the directions weren't much help either. The directions did have it on there where it is supposed to go, but I didn't know the name of the piece nor could I readily find it in there. After that, I installed this into my new guitar and strap and, I was ready to go. I HIGHLY recommend this! It is much easily to switch out straps w/o the possibility of striping the screws or boring into the screw hole and cracking some of the wood in the process.",positive,,
"I've been using these Fender straplocks over the last year:Fender 099 0818 300 F Straplock ChromeThe problem with those is that they use screws to secure that part that is on the strap itself, and the screw will slowly back itself out and you get yourself a disaster. I've decided to try these because they use a ""dual"" system: you can use the lock on your strap, or just use your ""regular"" strap without the locking mechanism. I've only been using these for a week, but so far, I like them much better than Fender's. I think I will replace all Fender straplocks with these.I do agree with the others on the fact that the screws are of lower quality, and the screw heads will strip if you're not careful. When I was installing these strap nuts, I screw in a half turn at a time, and applied lots of pressure so that the the head won't strip. If you can get over the installation, you got yourself a pretty good locking strap.",positive,,
"I have used Dunlop Straplocks for 32 years. I bought the original style years ago for my Strat, Les Paul and Partscaster; the last two having the most weight.These things have lasted through gigging and anything else i can throw at them with no problem. I ordered strap pins only a few months ago to put on a few more recent guitars and one of the push button locks finally went out. It was on the strap I used the most for the heavier guitars so I got some mileage out of that thing. I ordered a whole set of new ones here last month and put the locks on a new strap and the buttons on another guitar.I suggest these over the other brands - watch what touring bands use. These things lay flat and there are no protruding parts to catch. If you happen to be without a strap with locks on it, these new pins can be used like regular pins but are larger so a strap will be pretty much secure.The price is good, price them anywhere else and include shipping. I always buy strings, picks or other stuff to get free shipping.",positive,,
"Good Quality, great price, easy to install, easy to lock and unlock, fast delivery. Better than going to the always overpriced Guitar Center.",positive,,
I always purchase Grovers for my guitar straps but my 2014 Gibson Les Paul Standard Plus had a bigger strap knob so I bought this Dunlop and it fit the guitar perfectly. A good guitar is a big investment and you owe it to yourself to protect your investment with a good strap locking system.,positive,,
These are good if you have a few of guitars and got a favorite strap.  Buy alot of extra buttons i got allparts.  seems really sturdy and well made.,positive,,
"I went a long time convincing myself that I didn't need these.  I had numerous times when my strap would come undone - fortunately never during a performance.  These solved the problem.  I still check, but they just won't pull out or release.",positive,,
These guys are rock-solid and really easy to install. Any time I get a new instrument I change the stock buttons out for Dunlops!,positive,,
"I have these on my Jazz Bass, my guitar player has another brand. We were playing a HUGE downtown street gig in Altanta and were throwing T shirts to the crowd. Bending down, picking them up, then throwing. My guitar player had a different lock system, and his $1000 Les Paul fell to the stage, completely knocking it out of tune. Mine stayed locked perfectly...",positive,,
they work. its great not worrying about dropping your instrument on stage. ive done it  it sucked! worth every penny!,positive,,
Have them on four guitars. Never a malfunction. Easy installation and use. Watch out for bridge interference when screwing in the back lok. Might require a slightly shorter screw on some basses.,positive,,
"Work very well, nice low profile, easy push button on and off but, it is true, not good for thick straps. And the Gold Tone ones discolor easy with minimal use.",positive,,
"These are really great guitar locks!! I use them on all my guitars, and I would highly recommend them to anyone!!",positive,,
These work just like you want them to.  But a new strap and put these on right away.  It's worth it.,positive,,
i have purchased 5 of these strap locks. i would recommend them to all. they work good. very solid hold. thanks,positive,,
Again I feel line I work for Dunlop.....I don't just love the products .all my guitars and Basses have these locks,positive,,
I replaced the Schaller strap locks on my Strat with these. The Schaller ones ground on the connecting hardware to the point where I had to oil them a few times a month or I'd end up with an audible creak.Hands-down I like the Dunlop ones more. They installed in just a few minutes and the guitar feels very secure. No problems whatsoever. I just ordered my third set a few minutes ago.I'm a total convert - every new guitar I get is going to get a set of these put on it.,positive,,
"I put a pair of these on every guitar that I own.  I have a lot of extra strap clips around since I have many more guitars than straps, but these are great; they are all plenty tough, and if I find myself with my Straplok'd strap, it's nice that these work fine with a normal strap in a pinch.",positive,,
"Do as the manual says, lube them up every so often, and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button, and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes, and it works with most straps, as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box, it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however, as most straps are adjustable, so just adjust for the change in strap position, and you're golden!",positive,,
"About 4 years ago,  one of my friend dropped his bass and its body broke in half. that bass had regualr strap button, ever since then he use this dunlop straplok system. i recently built a bass myself and i install this one. it's very easy to install, very straight forward to use it. it holds my jazz bass without any problem. i would buy this from now on for all my electic guitars.",positive,,
"These are the ONLY straplocks I use, and I have them for ALL of my guitars.  They are the only ones I trust.  They are solid, secure, and they look great.  And the push button release makes them pretty convenient too, without sacrificing security.  Love 'em!!",positive,,
This the second set of strap locks that I've owned. They are a little difficult to attach to the strap if the thickness of the strap is a bit on the thicker side. The quick release and secure connection are great.,positive,,
"Dunlop is not the best strap lock system because it's a pain to switch which way the lock is pointing and people complain that the button is easy to unhook while playing. I can see the merits of screw on locks, what with the ease of switching the locks, but these work fine for me.",positive,,
"I hate spending 13 bucks on a couple little pieces of hardware that probably cost 13 cents to make, but its better than the 20 bucks local music shops want for this same set.  Overall they work really well and look sharp.  They fit perfectly on my Schecter Hellraiser.  Very happy with my purchase.",positive,,
"The Dunlop strap locks work pretty well, but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons.  The strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes.  This for all intents and purposes means that you will not be able to use that strap with standard strap buttons ever again.They do work as advertised and they are easy to take on and off for strap adjustment when required.",positive,,
"I play guitar and keyboard and, sometimes, I need to quickly put guitar on my back to play keyboards. I would not do that without this straplok.",positive,,
"The first thing I do when I get a new instrument, is put a straplok on it before gigging with it.They're easy to install, I haven't had one fail on me yet.I have straploks on nine instruments right now, and I just ordered another for my new bass...I can't recommend them highly enough!",positive,,
I&#8217,ve used strap locks before and never found any to be easy to attach or remove but these are well made and easy to use. Very secure. The best I&#8217,ve used so far.,positive
"I like this strap lock very strong very sturdy! Keeps things in place.. one problem.. The coating will wear out in a short time (a few months) and if you never take it off it might rust a bit on the inside. This might make it a bit hmm I don't want to say hard to lock, but you'd better make sure it is actually locked every time you fit it on by tugging on the thing to be sure, Mine has un-clipped a couple times because I didn't check. Our climate is humid so it's rust friendly which could contribute to why I'm having issues. However once clipped properly you shouldn't have issues! Great buy",positive,,
"Strings are half the battle with stringed instruments. A bad pair of strings on a nice instrument sound awful, and a good pair of strings can make a cheaper instrument sound tremendously better. Either way, stringes drastically effect the sound of an instrument at any price point. These strings make my cheap ukulele sound not-so-cheap, and I imagine they would do even more wonders on a uke of a higher price point. I also play guitar and Martin is one of my choice brands for strings so I figured they wouldn't let me down when I decided to play the ukulele - I was correct.",positive,,
".I BOUGHT A UKULELE  TO GIVE AS A PRESENT.  I KNEW THE STRINGS THAT COME EQUIPPED  ON NEW MUSICAL STRINGED INSTRUMENTS WOULD BE OF POOR QUALITY SO I PURCHASED THESE MARTIN STRINGS AS A REPLACEMENT.  I'VE USED MARTIN INSTRUMENTS FOR MANY YEARS, AM FOND OF THE MAKE AND QUALITY OF THE MARTIN PRODUCTS.  THIS WAS AN EASY CHOICE FOR ME. THERE ARE OTHER EXCELLENT STRINGS AVAILABLE.  THIS JUST WAS MY CHOICE THIS TIME.",positive,,
"I've been playing the uke since before they became popular again and must confess I own a quiver full of the addictive things (ranging from plywood beaters to a solid wood art object with an electric in between). Over the years, I've tried several different brands of string. The truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them. It's just that the Martin M600 strings seem a little bit more compliant than the others and this allows me to tease out a bit more articulation and tone. Given that string changing is a frequent occurrence with multiple instruments to fuel, the Martin string set's relatively low cost is a nice bonus.",positive,,
"Great guitar companies don't always make (or sell under their aegis) the best strings. I love my Teles but I can't stand Fender strings. Likewise, I love my Martin ukulele, but trying these strings for the second time, I had the same conclusion as I did the first; Aquila's are far better. Aquila's have a more organic feel and a fuller, richer sound. The Martins begin to hold their tune sooner - Aquila's take a couple of days or more - but the sound is thinner and the feel isn't nearly as friendly. The approximately 3 dollar price difference is not, for me, worth the lesser satisfaction, even on my least expensive ukes. Considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings, the higher-priced Aquila's still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks. Use the Martin's (or any cheaper string) when you are working on your uke, put the stress of repeatedly de-tuning and re-tuning on them. Then switch to Aquila's for playing. Some may like the Martins but few won't love the Aquila's.",positive,,
"Great replacement string  for your ukulele, great to have on hand in case or replace your strings after you get your uku.",positive,,
"Works as it should. Nice materials and I think it will be durable. Simple to attach to your mic stand and adjust as needed. It will improve your recordings, getting the pops and sssss out of your sound without having to do sound processing as much anyway.",positive,,
"great easily setup but some time i feel its not perfectly stop the P's, i don't know why but some time i have to keep distance for that issue",positive,,
"What a difference a pop filter makes, I use on a condenser mic, it lets me get a little more gain input, clamps on easy and holds good, the flex piece holding the filter could be a little more rigid but does the job. I like the way it looks when mounted on the mic stand extension, It has improved the vocal tracks. Just one more affordable improvement for the home studio.",positive,,
"Great quality and construction. Does it's job well. Only complaint is that if the design were a little more streamline. These bolt on with attitude and are a bit heavy. Overall, stays in place and does it's job well. A workhorse for sure.",positive,,
"For the price, this is the perfect pop filter... really good length and the clamp is decent, hope it will last me awhile...",positive,,
"When I bought these I was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording.  Once these are in position they work just fine, the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks.  The device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it.  The filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where I wanted it and to keep it there.On the plus side, the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use.",positive,,
no complaints.  attaches firmly and does the job.  Can't beat it for the price.  Order this with eyes closed.  Great deal.,positive,,
It works as a pop filter should and is a huge upgrade over my make-shift panty hose pop filter. What else is there to say?,positive,,
"Pop filter works great. This really eliminated many subtle flaws I had with audio recording. Granted, you can make a make-shift pop filter using a hollow ring and nylon. But the adjustable clamp is really...well adjustable so fits many unique mic placement situations. Plus, although it is flexible, it is also very sturdy so don't worry about and vibration noises coming from this.",positive,,
filter works very well and looks professional. only problem i am having is that the clamp seems to work specifically with a mic stand or similar type structure.,positive,,
"This works fine, although the mount is a bit weird to me... but I see that most are the same.  As a pop filter it works perfectly and I was not able to hear any clarity loss or sound coloring.  Just pop filtering through black pantyhose !! lol",positive,,
"this little guy has help me record with my Apogee One voices and amps, to prevent air-flow shock on diaphragm... wanna have excellent recordings? get one!",positive,,
"Wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh? Some people pay for silver and expect gold ;)Okay, so I bought this because I do app review videos for a blog and my Blue Snowball mic was picking up the awful ""pop"" sounds that this is supposed to filter ""hard P, hard T, hard B, S, and a few others."" So I got this. Here are my pros and cons:Pros1. It works. I tested in Sony Vegas pro with and without the filter. The ""pop"" sound is completely removed with the filter. Which means it does what it was designed to do. 5-stars. It does not affect voice volume at all, just smooths those rough edges in your speech :D2. It looks nice. Attached to my Blue Snowball, it looks like a professional product. It doesn't really matter since I work from home and not in a public place, but it's nice to know I can show it to people and it ""looks nice""3. The clamp, bendable arm, and everything work appropriately. The clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface. So mounting this to, say, a desk probably won't be a stable as attached to a round thing, like the stem to a mic.4. I don't know why people think this ""isn't sturdy""...I mean you're not going to the local rink and playing hockey with the darn thing. The build quality is quite excellent considering that it's 2 fragile screens attached to plastic and metal.Cons1. It's pretty big. I used to shorten the stem on my Blue Snowball and stash it in a cubby hole in my hutch desk for easy storage. I can't do that anymore with this pop filter on it. Now it's become a permanent member of the front of my desk.Outside of this thing doubling the space my Snowball takes up, I have no complaints about this pop filter. It works well, it attaches nicely, it does what it is supposed to do, it looks nice, and the quality is good. This should be the last pop filter I have to buy for a long time.",positive,,
"Filter is of good size (6"") and easily comes apart for changing the fabric (I will probably use panty hose) if it gets torn. Other than that it works so what more can be said",positive,,
it keeps the spit off the mic and looks cool when recording - it does great at keeping you mouth off the mic so you dont breath it out and fits great on the stands with easy clamp,positive,,
"Yes, you can make your own pop filter at home, but you don't want to.  Why else would you be reading this?  Besides, it won't look this good.I've purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months.  The most recent one I purchased was NOT this one.  I wish it was.  I thought I'd try something different, just to see the differences.  Well, I can tell you that there are significant differences between this, and some of the others featured here.The bottom clamp on this one features a rubber piece that grips the metal pole that you attach to.  The competitors that I've tried do not.  If you do not have this rubber piece, any clamp will tend to slip down the pole and not grip properly.  This is a huge mistake as this makes using a pop filter on a boom stand impossible.  Fortunately, Nady placed this rubber piece on it's clamp so this has never been an issue.The only complaint I have is the screen has actually popped out of the plastic ring a couple times.  A single dot of superglue fixed that.Compared to the other pop filters I've seen and used, this one is perfectly suited for any microphone and at a reasonable price you can't beat it.And yes, pop filters ARE A MUST with condenser microphones.  Just buy one now, save yourself the trouble.",positive,,
"It does what it's supposed to do. It's as well made as most, I think. They all look cheap to me, unless you get a studio professional grade. The screen pops out easily, but it will pop back in. It works well for my home recording.",positive,,
"Peter Piper Picked A Pack of Purple Peppers - test passed, no &#34;puh&#34; sound to be found on the recording.",positive,,
"This is a decent pop filter. It gets the job done but it has a few flaws. It attracts a good amount of dust, the screen tends to mess up (which caused me to tear the first screen), & the goose neck tends to unwrap it's self out of place. It also gets shakey so I tend to have to screw it back in. Other than that, it's a decent pop filter but not for the price. Under $10 would've been better. I should have went with something cheaper than $20 *cough cough* the Auphonix pop filter *cough cough* but, I will in the future.",positive,,
"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then, I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost.",positive,,
"Though I'd warn if you don't know about audio this does not mean you can place your mic right in front of you and have the pop filter magically de-esse the whole thing, but between the pop filter and a slightly off-center placement it seems to keep the majority of erroneous pops and esses's from making an appearance in any way.",positive,,
"works very well, keeps the popping to a bare minimum, easy to install, cleans in a flash, lightweight and works",positive,,
"I do a lot of podcasts and dubbing over videos, and after using this filter, the pop that occurs with P's and B's in the voice are basically gone. It makes your audio more professional when you eliminate these annoyances.",positive,,
"When you record singing, you need this to prevent the pop sound. It is definitely worth it. It also makes you looks professional.",positive,,
"This pop-filter rocks. I like it a lot, does well compared to lots of other filters I tried. It's got a nice look too.",positive,,
"Use this for home recordings and some voice over recordings for work. I like the long neck on it and its a double filter so you get a tad bit extra. I tested it against my single filter and it did make a difference, as expected. It makes sense that if you have an additional layer there it will filter more effectively, but I wasnt sure if it would effect tone or highs, and I didnt notice either effected.",positive,,
This was a great investment for my home studio. I've been able to eliminate the majority of pops coming from my Condenser Microphone. I should of bought this a long time ago!!,positive,,
"I use it with an Audio Technica 2020, it work very well, the filter stays in place and it really improves the quality of the recording. Not much else to say.",positive,,
works well but wish it was a bit heavier and the construction was a little better made. but other than that works as intended.,positive,,
"I love this pop filter!  It is every to attactch and doesn't scratch the mic stand as some pop filter clamps do.  The adjustable arm is very flexible, yet sturdy to assure you of proper pop filter placement.",positive,,
"For the price, this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However, there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that, if I pick up the mic, the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once, but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works.",positive,,
Tested this on my Blue Yeti USB Microphone and could tell the difference with the POP filter on right away. Good investment.,positive,,
There too many required words to type for a product that doesn't need that much explanation.  It mounts to any mic stand and is formable to any position you need.  sturdy.,positive,,
"A needed accessory for any vocal recording, period. My only gripe about this model is why the straight bracket part needs to stick out so dang far, since you can bend the arm out in any position anyway.",positive,,
"Well thought out unit that does what it says it will, drop all that POP! I really like the way the clamp connector is rubberized to protect the finish of your mic stand. And being that it is rubberized, it allows you to adjust the filter to the mic without having to loosen everything up because rubber has an inherent &#34;give.&#34; And this is where the flexible arm allows you to fine tune the filters proximity to the singer, allowing you to do what you do best -- Sing! And then; and now for the really important part: everything stays where you last left it. Hell, even my cats can't do that, and they're porcelain.",positive,,
"Good solid construction. It hooks onto the mic stand and works as advertised, i.e removes the pops from vocal recordings.",positive,,
Very sturdy and awesome pop filter. Adjustable to any length you want and just a great pop filter! I would recommend this to anyone!,positive,,
This filter arrived very quickly! I use it with a Scarlett mic and it does exactly what a pop filter should. Good purchase.,positive,,
"These are high quality cables, both construction wise and in audio quality.  I use these shorter cables if I have to run bits of my rack to external amps/units, ie: unplugging and plugging in a lot, and I find these cables stand up to more abuse than the average cable.  I'm satisfied.",positive,,
Good Quality cable and price. Works as good as those expensive 99 dlls cables.It does not make any noise,positive,,
"Sometimes I have to run a longer cable to a snake if I'm doing the big band thing. Otherwise, I use this cable at every show. Love it.",positive,,
Looks vintage but works great at a great price. As good or better than my Monster cable for a lot less money!,positive,,
"This is my second Spectraflex cable and I love them. I love their flexibility, options for colors and ends, build quality and price. I like to use quality guitar cables for a good sound but I don't need to spend a fortune on them to be run over on stage by roadies or ripped off because the cable costs more than some guitars do.",positive,,
got this short cord to go from amp to waa! It works perfect for it I own a few Spectraflex cables and they are all fine,positive,,
"Rugged ends very flexible seem like this cable should hold up very well , does not tangle which is a real plus if you tend to move around a lot , connectors seem to be heavy duty , time will tell but I would assume that this cable should last a long time .",positive,,
"After suffering through crackles, lost signals, and all the rest, I decided to heed the numerous positive reviews of the Spectraflex tweed cable and purchase one through Amazon.com.  Because the new acoustic-electric classical I received as a gift has an end-pin outlet, I bought the Spectraflex with the right angle connector.  Although I have been using the cable for only a few weeks, I am very impressed.  The connections on all the guitars and basses on which I've used it are sure, with no loss of signal, no crackles.  Perhaps most impressive is the fact that I can turn the right angle connector around and never have any change of signal.  Finally, I can be confident that when I play, something will consistently come out of the amplifier.  By the way, the old-school tweed look is a plus, too.",positive,,
"Well, what can I say? Based on the customer reviews, this purchase seemed like a no-brainer. However, after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. The cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). And before you ask, &#34;is it perhaps your output jack?&#34;, all of my other cables work with my gee-tar. So it is definitely the cable :(Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120.",positive,,
"Spectraflex makes great cables. I bought this right angle 10' red cable for my older Ibanez guitar. This cable is built to be extremely durable, is made in the USA, and comes with a lifetime warrantee. The 20 gauge construction and rugged nylon braiding makes for a very low noise cable, and the connectors are very secure and feel quite substantial (especially compared to a cheaper Fender cable I had been using that required almost constant tightening.) Though Spectraflex cables are not the least expensive (nor the most expensive,) they are a great value and I am definitely a fan. I recommend this cable without reservations.",positive,,
"I purchased three of these (three different colors) to make a mini-snake for my keyboard to their Di's.  I typically used Mogami 2524/Neutrik, but need cakes while in the road (I usually roll my own to exact length).  These have worked well, quiet, no handling noise, seem well built (I treat cables well, so I don't really test them with under tough circumstances) and hopefully will remain in their spot for the foreseeable future.  They are used 6 nights a week, and after 50 uses, no problems.  I recommend them (plus, for live, the fabric cables in different colors are great for easily identifying which is which for a road crew member who might not know audio well.).  Nice pieces...",positive,,
"I keep this cable on my pedal board -Pedaltrain MINI With Soft Case. I've posted a photo on the pedaltrain Mini page. The right angle connector is great to exit the last pedal on the board and the straight connector goes into the amp. I use a Mogami silent cable -Mogami Platinum Guitar 12, Straight to Straight with Quiet Plug 12 feet- for the input to my guitar, but I can't justify paying a LOT more money for the side that goes to my amp (it's not getting bumped around, plugged and unplugged, etc.). This cable works perfect for it's purpose. Oh yeah... and it matches my tweed amp!!",positive,,
"This is a pretty strong cable. I wanted something I can plug into my top loaded amp and the jack would stand out in case I'm sitting on the amp. the angle does the job. seams strong , seams like it will last.",positive,,
I bought two to run from my amp to a lone pedal effect that I use with my bass.  The 90 degree ends go to the pedal and it makes for a non-intrusive smart looking setup.  I'm pleased.  I've owned them for a few months now.  No issues at all and they look good.,positive,,
"I'm a professional musician and love these cables, they look great and perform great and feel a lot tougher than the rubber covered cables I've been using",positive,,
This has become my number one cable for my Carvin bass. I gig with it a couple times per week and it has been rock solid. I only use something different if I need a longer reach. And I love the tweed cover. Very satisfied with this one.,positive,,
"I've had this little amplifier for a few weeks and I couldn't ask for a better practice amp. It's amazing how loud it gets in an otherwise quiet room, but it'll get drowned out pretty quickly when you add competing sounds. It's rugged and portable, and it's fun to play around with some of the effects. The fact that it runs on batteries is a huge plus.",positive,,
Might work well for recording too when you take the output jack.  Speaker is acceptable quality but can't be compared with a Fender amp as this one has 5 watts and a small speaker and the other has 10-20 watts.  I'm opting for the convenience of the size.  I got this after getting a couple smaller amps and headphone monitor plugs since it has both and was better sound with good effects.  I like the 'brit' setting.  I sound like a rock star with it.  Good product for practice or recording.  You could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig.  But for around the same price you could get a Fender amp.  This product works for me and the quality is pretty good.  Other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this.,positive,,
"There are several types of practice amps. High end modlers (Line 6, G Dec, Vox VT) that can still run $400+ and are typically overloaded with features. The low end tubes (Fender Blues Junior, Bug V22, Peavey Valveking, etc). These typically are more stripped down (in features, not neccessarily quality). And then there are the micros. I always thought they were just a notch above toys, the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from Wally World at Christmas.Boy was I wrong...I needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school. It was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear. He's not a big kid, so even 15lb. amps are pushing it(plus a gig bag and school back pack). That was initially what brought me to the Micro. Not sound or features, just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso. Turns out this is an AMAZING amp. The tone destroys the Line 6 and the features crush the Vox Pathfinder (6watt?) or Bug V12. And the Fender frontman - not even in the ballpark.Each of the models are distinct. The cleans are sparkly (more trebly) and the high gain models are very articulate. Obviously this isn't a loud amp, but that's not all bad. You can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes. It also can be battery powered (the life is suprisingly long), includes a regular wall plug, headphone jack, built in tuning fork (which is kind of lame) and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously. For example, I was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some Dick Dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy.Don't let the size fool you. I honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and I couldn't have been more wrong.  There are several big websites and it's tough to find any negatives about this amp. Quality sounding and durable for a great price.Oh - and the red - if you can find it - looks pretty sweet too.",positive,,
Great little amp. I had to take my Ampeg Jet in for a maintenance and I just love this little practice amp. I enjoy using it with both my Fender Strat and my Rickenbacker.,positive,,
"I bought this amp to replace a Squier SP-10 that came with my guitar.  The Squier had no effects, just a clean channel and an overdrive button.  I couldn't afford a bunch of pedals, but I wanted some effects so I could get cool sounds from my electric guitar.  I saw the reviews for this little amp on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It is Awesome!  For such a small amp, the output is plenty loud for practicing at home, and it runs on batteries, too, so I can take it anywhere.  The effects are better than I'd hoped for.  This is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer, but for an intermediate level guitarist (like me) who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family, this is the amp to get.  It has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus, flanger, phaser, or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay.  I'm one of the growing number of retirees who decided to pick up the guitar and learn more about it now that I have the time.  I don't need the deafening stacks that the kids like.  I love this amp.",positive,,
This pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries.  We've used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up.  We are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it.  We are using an mp3 player for backup.  The sound is not quite as clear as we get with our Roland Cm-30 (so only 4 stars from me).  The micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and it's nice not to have to load up cart to roll around.  Guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features.,positive,,
The MicroCube came with new AC Adaptor that supports 110V and 240V. Now I can take it along and use it in Europe/ Asia and USA.I saved $30 from buying another AC adapter that supports 240V.Happy Customer!,positive,,
"A good solid piece of equipment! It sounds as good as it looks and it is absolutely beautiful! The description listed slight wear marks on the back, but I had to really look hard to find it (one). It came as well packed as a brand-new guitar and looks like one!",positive,,
"Tone control didn't work so it was returned.  But it was pretty nice even though I felt the fret-board quality is higher on my 900 Gibson Les Paul but what can you expect.  If I had to order it again I would pay 140 more and get the SG 400 which has the quality pickups.  The sound is let's say... average.  Good beginner guitar, or a guitar that can be upgraded with new pickups.  The bolt-in neck didn't bother me but the SG 400 doesn't have that which is another reason I would step up next time.  Shape is ok.  Purely subjective.  I like the solid Les Paul shape now a little better since it's more conservative.  But the size is good and almost more comfortable than the Les Paul style.  Can't believe they can make a good guitar like this for only 160 bucks.  Also, even though I was tempted with the faded finish, the glossy finish is really nice.  This guitar will make a player proud.",positive,,
"For the money you can't find a better deal.  I am currently overseas and didn't want to bring my good guitar along.  This is a great playing guitar for the money, comes packaged extremely well and high quality all around for the price.",positive,,
"I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadn't.  The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes, but oh well. Now on to the guitar itself.....This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isn't a professional musician, I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics, mainly the switch could use some replacing.  I'm not complaining, I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169, you can't expect to have the top of the line.To sum it up, I love this guitar.  I keep in E flat tuning and it stays.  To me, a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop it's tuning a little.",positive,,
"i love this thing!!!  action is perfect,  great sound,  good feel, easy to play i highly recomend this",positive,,
At first it look small for my guitar but it fits perfectly with my Epiphone LP-100 Les Paul Electric Guitar,positive,,
Now-a-days I just search amazon because they have always got what I want at reasonable prices. This is no exception. I am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro to the guitar guy for setup etc. This was was better then I expected. It is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit. In other words great all around. I know it sits on a self with many other guitars when I take it in to the guitar guys so I am perfectly confident that it is well protected. and it is lockable (with key)If you are looking for a more then good case for your Epi LP just get this one. You will not be disappointed.Also. I ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day. No special shipping. Maybe it is my locations but that was great too. Well packed.,positive,,
"love the case nice and simple, it really look exactly the same as the picture. highly recommend to everyone looking for a case.",positive,,
"Bought this along with the guitar as a present for my daughter. The guitar fits in this case perfectly, and is very well protected.",positive,,
I ordered this for my Epi LP Special 2 and obviously it fits like a glove! Beautiful interior and a comfortable padded handle. Solid hinges and even comes with hinge lock on the center hinge.,positive,,
"Basically, this case is very sharp looking - made with good quality materials. The inside of the one I received was grey fur. The case would probably take a beating over time, but its not a SKB case. Nice enough that I wouldn't check it at the airport. Survived a trip in a moving van from Philly to Boston.Would definitely recommended if you need a case that your Les Paul fits very snugly and safely into.",positive,,
"This case it built really well, it has really nice plush interior... storage area for picks-strings-tuning fork-etc in the neck, it DOES have a lock on one of the latches. The case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got; so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it. Turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key... so dont worry. Just dont be an idiot like me and give it a good tug when you get it.Above all it fits my Epi LP perfectly... as it should! hehe.",positive,,
"Its a tight fitting case. I am a proud owner of aEpiphone Les Paul Custom Proand it fits as snug as can be. When I ordered the case I assumed it would be made for my guitar. It arrived double boxed and wrapped in plastic. I am sure I received a new case. Being perfectly  protected as it was, it hadn't a mark on it so.As far as the construction, it not a flight case by any means. It looks as though it will hold up to at least some abuse and still do its job, to protect the guitar. My guitar does not move in the case due to its perfect fit. With this said, over time there is a possibility of wear. I would predict the buckles may be the first to fail. And then handle doesn't look as durable as it could be , we'll see on that.Overall this is the case for the Epiphone Les Paul. I saw the Gibson case and I just don't see them as superior enough to justify paying more. I am satisfied with my purchase and I think most people would be. Five stars for now. I will edit in the future if necessary.",positive,,
Very nice case for the price.  Solid construction and perfect fit and protection for my Epiphone LP.  Would definately recommend.,positive,,
"Hello, I bought a Epiphone Goth Studio guitar and I also bought this beauty. I'm very satisfied with the quality of this case, as it makes my guitar looks very nice and very nice protected.",positive,,
"this case is the best i've ever had...very plush on the inside, and hard construction on outside is very strong...the handle extreamly soft to the touch...i guess all my other cases just don't measure up to this one...it even locks...if your guitar fits...but this for the quality!!!",positive,,
"The case is hard on the outside and soft on the inside as it should be. The pocket inside is nice for holding accessories. It does include a lock on the middle latch, but somehow mine eventually stopped working, as the lock isn't very good quality. The lock cylinder itself fell inside the lock and can no longer be used. Otherwise great case, highly recommended.",positive,,
"I use this for my Epiphone Zakk Wylde Custom Les Paul. It fits perfectly in the case, one of the best cases I own and have seen, the carpet is awesome, also has a pocket in the middle, what holds the neck up, and can fit a strap and even a pedal. Very durable case and seems like the younger brother of the more expensive Gibson case.",positive,,
"An affordable guitar case that fits my guitar perfectly. That's all there really is to say, if you need a sturdy guitar case  for a Les Paul styled guitar and don't want to spend a butt-load of money, look no further.",positive,,
I bought the bigger version of this for my Riviera P93 and this case is just as plush and protective- best deal going for a brand new case - I just wish they had these for more brands-,positive,,
"I do some guitar repair work and one of my customers needed a LP case. I have bought a lot of stuff here on AZ so looked at this one and had it shipped to him. He says its great so that is my review.Prices are always great on AZ and Prime saves me money in shipping.4 stars is my tops, anywhere.",positive,,
"I could not believe the quality of this case, fits my Epiphone Les Paul 100 like a glove.  Very plush interior, plenty of storage and very durable.",positive,,
I'm not much for brand names on my guitar cases. I figure it tells would-be thieves what they're getting!  I sprayed a little matte-black paint over the Epiphone logo. The case itself is quite sturdy and the inside is very plush. It fits my Line 6 JTV Variax in a very cozy way. Great case for small cash!,positive,,
"Ordered one of these Gig Bags for a new Les Paul - the hard shell cases are back-ordered, and I didn't want the guitar just sitting attracting dings and dust.Fits a LP Studio perfectly, has room for small items in an outer zippered pocket. Does the Job !",positive,,
"If you're looking for something to protect your guitar until you can afford a good hard case, this is it. For the price, it has better padding than I expected and is equipped with carrying handles and a shoulder strap with metal buckles and snaps. Good deal for the price!",positive,,
"As the title states, this is a lightly padded duffle bag, nothing more. If you're toating between practice with an instructor, it's okay. I purchased it for that reason...and I'm an adult, so I can be careful. This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. It will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it.There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price.",positive,,
"This bag is light, with two back pack straps, a pocket for accessories, excellent quality material and a good quality zipper.  If you just need something lightweight to protect your instrument this is it.",positive,,
"Good quality bag for my Epi LP. Fit like a glove, in fact I wish they were a little larger to hold some accessories.",positive,,
"At &lt;$20, this is a great bargain, but it is a very basic bag. It fits my Les Paul Standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying. These are also easily removed if they bother you. This Epiphone gigbag also has a zippered pocket for accessories (holds a strap, patch cord, but not much else) and features nice looking graphics.",positive,,
"Rugged, robust, flexible. Couldn't ask for more in a momentary switch. Like all Boss products it will probably last longer than me.",positive,,
"I got this for use with the Boss DD-20 as a tap-tempo. It does the job well, it's a little big for what it is, but definitely worth having with a delay pedal",positive,,
"I got this for my Boss Loop Station, but it doesn't work very well.  I keep hoping I'll find something it DOES work well with...",positive,,
No problem at all.Great quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand. Thak you very much!,positive,,
"I could not beat the price. The pedal does what is suppose to do on my Dynamic Wah guitar pedal. It is well build and I can use it on other Boss and Roland gear. Also, it not to big. It does not hog up a lot of space on my pedal board. Very happy with this item.",positive,,

"Summary for those who don't want to read the whole thing: This is more than worth the money. If you're a beginner looking for a first guitar or if you're experienced and are searching for a backup/travel option or anything like that, get this. Do not hesitate. A cheap guitar doesn't ALWAYS mean a POS!Alright, full story/review:So, when I was a kid up until my early teens my (insanely talented and self-taught) older brother helped me learn how to play guitar. I got pretty decent but somewhere along the way I stopped and I've regretted it basically every day ever since then. Recently, I decided to stop internally griping about it and realized I should actually DO something about it. So, here I am.Having previously lived in a house with multiple guitarists, I have heard the sounds of expensive guitars and I have heard the sounds of the cheapest guitars (like a typical beginner's First Act). I knew there was a middle ground and I was determined to find it. I got way more than I bargained for.I began my quest knowing that my funds were limited. There was no way I could afford to dive right in and buy a high end, top of the line Fender or Martin like I had had the benefit of learning on back in the day. I knew I had to go cheap, at least for now. I began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars. After an exhaustive amount of research, I chose this one due to the positive reviews and because all of the demos I'd pulled up on YouTube were excellent. Plus, Epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general.Despite the positive reviews, I was still a bit leery; buying instruments without actually handling them first is always a bit of a gamble. Even if it sounds nice and plays well, sometimes a perfectly solid, functional instrument just doesn't FEEL right. As I went through the checkout I silently reminded myself that I could send it back for any reason. I went into this fully knowing that there was a good possibility I'd just have to bite the bullet and buy something better, even if costlier.Well, it arrived earlier this week and I am not disappointed. I certainly didn't expect perfection and I was convinced that I would find some kind of error, if only cosmetic, with such a cheap guitar. I am here to tell you that I have not found anything wrong with it. Even if I had (unless it drastically affected the sound/playability of the instrument), it would still be worth the price.Along with the guitar I bought some new strings (Martins) because 9/10 times the stock strings that come on instruments are awful. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable. I see that some of the other reviewers disagree. Maybe their strings were older or maybe it's just preference, I don't know. All I can say is that the stock strings on my guitar were not at all corroded/old. Shockingly enough, the guitar was pretty close to being in tune right out of the box! It doesn't seem to have any trouble staying in tune, either. All of that being said, it wouldn't hurt to pick up a pack of strings just to be safe. I mean, I'm sure that when I do finally put the Martins on I'll be even more mind-blown than I already am with the way it sounds.This guitar has a full, rich sound, plays comfortably (the low action helps!), and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets. Oh, and contrary to what other reviews have said - YES, it DOES have a truss rod. While we're talking about its positives, let's not ignore the fact that it's also super attractive with its shiny black finish. There isn't much about it that would give away its price. No, it's not a $1000 guitar but it certainly doesn't play like a $100 guitar either! I don't regret this purchase at all. Even in the future when I progress and upgrade I will definitely be keeping this lovely gem!If you're still unsure, do what I did and listen to some demos on YouTube. I doubt you'll be disappointed. (Pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the GearWire YouTube channel did. He clearly doesn't know what he's talking about and I, as well as everyone else in the comments section, was sure to express my feelings about that, haha! One user even claimed Epiphone should sue him!) Check out the video reviews by the users/companies GoldHat3, SamAshMusic, GigGear, and ShadowFW.My only complaint about this guitar is that I didn't buy it sooner!Good luck on your search, I hope this review has helped!",positive,,
"First off; let me start by saying I bought this guitar because it was only $100 and I was board on my deployment and wanted something to brush up on before I return home.I DID NOT: expect good quality, sound or comfortably from this guitar.I DID: want something cheap I could toss around and use out here in the desert without worrying about it getting beaten up or trashed.When I unboxed this guitar I was floored! The hardware is much higher quality than I had expected by far. The strings it came with weren't complete crap, but I swapped them out for my favorite set of strings: Ernie Ball 2406 Ernesto Palla Nylon Black and Silver Classical strings. The guitar sings beautifully; the tone is rich and vibrant.It's quite comfortable to play, I have no problems playing up to the 16th fret without this guitar having a cut away. I'm not a big fan of the pick guard that has the Epiphone 'E' on it, so I will probably end up removing it; but the sunburst is really nice looking. I have received many compliments on the look of it already.OVER ALL: this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag. GET IT!Also; I'm buying a hard case to take it home, or shipping this guitar back home to myself because I want to keep it as part of my collection. My original thought was to buy this guitar and leave it out here at the Rec tent for other people to use after I'm gone. Even if I do decide to leave it out here; I'll be buying another one when I get home!",positive,,
"This is NOT my first guitar. Nor am I breathless Epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of Taylors and Martins. It's not. Here's what it is: An exceedingly well-constucted, AMAZINGLY playable guitar. Fit, finish, feel and action were all VERY nice... Sound on the other hand? Let's face it. It's plywood all around. It SOUNDS like plywood. But that doesn't distract from the fact that it's a great guitar for $100 bucks.It's a fine &#34;first&#34; guitar. It's a great beach/camping/cabin guitar. Leave it in your car to practice at lunch. Leave it in the office. ANY guitar is better than no guitar... And this guitar is better than a LOT of other entry level guitars.Seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box... New, premium strings DO make a difference.If your expectations are for a playable, rugged, affordable guitar you won't be disappointed. If sound quality is your primary concern, well... You are going to have to spend more than a hundred bucks to be happy.For my desired application, this guitar was great... I'm very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat.",positive,,
It is my son's first guitar and he is learning on it well.  It is still in great condition. good quality Guitar!,positive,,
"this thing plays great!!  action is low but does not buzz, very easy to chord.i highly recomend this guitar.",positive,,
"Well constructed with quality woods, saddle/nut and bracing. Neck and frets are straight, level and do not snag. This guitar rings like a bell, stays in tune and is light weight. Do not let the low price fool you but do not expect the guitar to come set up to your tastes. Any guitar that you buy will need to be adjusted to your style of play. The strings may be too high or too light or whatever, just be ready to do a tiny bit of work to get it like you want it then it will serve you well. Do not buy a Luna, Davidson, Main Street, or any other 'no name' - get this one.",positive,,
"I normally use nylon picks but do some songs with flatpicking intros and the nylons were to flappy. These picks keep a nice bright tone, very little friction on the strings - so low string noise. Enough grip to stay put in hands well too.",positive,,
"I've been buying Dunlop pick for at least 15 years now, and I love the feel and the grip. The picks last for a really long time, and I would recommend getting several thickness' for different applications. But for sitting in a room playing around, with my acoustics and electric guitars this is a decent all round pick",positive,,
I tried this but ended up going back to Tortex.  I like the satin finish on the Tortex better and the way it bends.  The Ultex has a little brighter attack though and wears out less quickly.  Ultex sounds more like the Fender celluloid.,positive,,
Sounds great. I own 5 different gauges. I like the gripping surface. .90 is my favorite gauge and the rounded tip is super fast.,positive,,
Guitar picks make a huge part of your tone.  Especially on acoustic.  These are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion.  They have a long life and do brighten your tone.  Freshening up the picks is easy just by rubbing them on your carpet or  carpet scrap to bring back the original shape.,positive,,
"These are nice, I like the 1.14 rigidity and these are just fine for me... you will wear them out on acoustics though if you are a more aggressive player as I am.  Once these are worn, as with most picks, they sound considerably different.  Much more grainy and tin-y but that may be a plus for you?  I also like the side edges for a real mellow and / or speeding picking style.  They stay in your fingers well.",positive,,
The grip is excellent. But I prefer the 1.14 Sharps over these. These are sturdy and look like I won't be needing another set for quite some time,positive,,
I bought the wrong gauge. I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. I bought the .90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them. These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound. I don't know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them. Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.Buy em!!!!,positive,,
I love the pick attack with these.  I have used almost everything out there over 20 years of playing and have settled on this pick as my go-to choice for acoustic guitar.,positive,,
"Didn't think I'd be compelled to review something like a guitar pick, but the Dunlop Ultex has really impressed me thus far.  I use the .60 thickness, which is equivalent to the orange plastic Dunlop pick.  The orange pick is my favorite for acoustic and most electric playing, but they do wear down and fray on the edges, and have a little more friction that I'd like.This Ultex seems very resistant to wear and has surprisingly little drag over the string.  I find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold.  It gives just enough to use for smooth strumming, while being rigid enough for individual notes.Some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use.  If that turns out to be a problem, I might reconsider my review.  But out of the box, they perform as well as any pick I have used!",positive,,
"Grabbed these on impulse as I needed some new ones. Normally I used the old Fender Medium or Heavy picks, but I gotta say these are great. Stiff but flexible enough to maneuver plus they glide nicely. Not sure what could be said to prove it, but they just feel great.",positive,,
"I've used the Tortex picks for a while now, and have been really happy with them. This pick however, takes it to the next level. Very strong and great bite for a relatively thin pick. I use the .73 for acoustic and the same holds true. Great product.",positive,,
"This polish was recommended in one of Dan Erlewine's books and it works great.  It really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop.  The effect isn't as noticeable on darker finishes though.  It really helps on the back of the neck too, makes it slippery and fast.  Highly recommended.",positive,,
"I got this to clean my Washburn acoustic guitar, and it worked great. I used it to clean off the fingerprints and grime, and then would buff in a circular motion with my soft, lint-free rag, and it would act like a polish. The finish sparkled afterwards, even in the light. Great product.",positive,,
"Ive been using this polish since the early 80's. It doesn't smell the way some do and works fantastic on all of my guitars. Wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars. What has hurt my guitars is me dropping them or sweating all over them, but this polish? No way. Martin knows what they're doing. I use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes.",positive,,
"Used it once, but once was enough. Had been using Gibson Polish, although it worked fine, just couldn't force myself to use it on my Martin Veterans Model Guitar.",positive,,
This product is excellent.  Cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue.  Made my little Martin look almost as good as new.,positive,,
"this is the one that everyone told me I should use, being new to guitar I figured one polish (car) has to work well, that was very incorrect on my part, this is for the delicate woods and preserves them far better than ordinary polishes",positive,,
I bought this for my son to clean his guitar with. He really likes it a lot. It works very well if you use it with a microfiber cloth. I would buy this product again!,positive,,
"put it in my Fender dreadnaught and only wish i have held out for the the next step up in quality with the mic as well...  Love it to death, had it pertinently installed and love the sound and the versatility.  the built in volume knob it a GREAT tough.  I could go on, but there are reviews on you tube that will do a better Job than here.",positive,,
"I like the fact that it can be &#34;partially&#34; installed with the cord coming out of the sound hole or it can be easily installed on a more permanent basis by cutting the cord to length and running it inside the guitar body through the end pin hole (which will have to be enlarged a bit).  Either way, once plugged in, it sounds great.  This pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar, a Blueridge BR-160.  I installed some Fishman &#34;under the saddle&#34; pickups in a few Martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good, if not better.  If you don't mind the pickup visible in the sound hole, this is the way to go.  Another nice thing about it is the ease of changing out the batteries as compared to the undersaddle type pickups where the batteries are attached to the inside body of the guitar.",positive,,
"This is not a bad product, just not great.  As soon as I received it, I installed it on my custom made Grit Laskin Guitar, and played with it for over two hours.  Installation was fast, and only took a couple of minutes.  My problems with it are 3 fold:  #1.  Sounds just a bit ""tinny"" = too much on the high end, and not an equal amount of bass.  #2.  A small complaint is that you have to dismantle the entire installation just to change the batteries, and I couldn't get mine to work in ""passive"" mode.  #3.  And the biggest complaint, is that the volume control is difficult to get to when you're performing on stage.  You have to stick your finger in the hole on the top side of the strings and fumble around trying to change the volume which is very sensitive so all of sudden you can be too loud or too soft.  Like I said, it is not a bad product, just not top notch, and definitely not for professionals.  If you're just fooling around at home, or recording at home, it is fine, and will do the job for you.  BUT!!!  If you're a pro, you'll want to spend double the money and get an L. R. Baggs M-80.  The M-80 gives you the truest sound (unbelievable), works in passive mode, and is very easy to change the volume control.  Sincerely, Doc",positive,,
"Great pickup, combined with the Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I. you will have an excellent experience.  Even the pick up by itself into a quality amp will make you happy.",positive,,
I was looking for a sound hole pickup and this came as one of the best and found it to be all I expected. I use it for practice and recording myself. I really like it but for the price I wish it had just a bit more otherwise its perfect. I have it on my 1994 Martin D-18  which has a big bottom end and no matter what it always sounds fine. I have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good.,positive,,
What can I say? These are probably the most well-known pads available and probably the best. This was the best price I could find on Amazon and they arrived as described via very prompt shipping.,positive,,
"Ok, so I just installed these things for my KRK 6's (no stands...just sitting on two other speakers).  What can I say?  The bass, which previously had disappeared in my studio, is now present again!  My monitors sounded kinda thin before because I was losing so much energy to my desk, but these things have made a ton of difference!  My stereo image even feels wider now!Sure, they're a little pricy, but hey...THEY WORK!  If that's what they want to charge for them, and people continue to buy them, I'm cool with that!  I'm happy with the reults my $40 got me!5/5!",positive,,
"These really do work great. No more desk vibrations and the sound out of my monitors are very clear now. I do only wish i could of found these in a smaller size since they are way bigger then my 5"" monitors. If anyone knows where to get smaller ones let me know. Thanks!",positive,,
"These MoPads are pretty amazing. I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these pads.These pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment. Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk. I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors. At $40, you can't go wrong with these pads for you studio. It is a MUST to have these.",positive,,
These are laser cut pads for your studio monitors. I feel more vibration from a hard drive spinning on my desktop than the sounds coming out of my speakers. And they look professional too.,positive,,
"Just what I needed for my Home Studio Monitors that sit on the table next to my Computer and my DAW system, was surprised at how many different versions I was sent, they all work well thanks heaps......",positive,,
"The reviewer who wrote that that these are ""cheap foam"" worth $5.00, doesn't understand or appreciate the quality of these speaker isolators. A/B these with some $5.00 cheap foam and you will realize how good these Auralex isolators work. I am using a pair of Behringer Truth active speakers that weigh 33 pounds each. These isolators not only support them very well but solved a big problem I had. It seems my speakers were ""audio coupling"" with the console they were placed on making the console vibrate with the spaekers and muddy up the lower fequencies.My problem started when I noticed that my mixes sounded good on other systems except for the bass frequencies around 80-125 HZ. Apparently my Behringer speakers were not accurately reproducing that fequency range and I was EQing that range badly to compensate. I didn't hear it when I mixed my Hafler M-1 speakers. I was about to give up on the Behringer Truth speakers but I really thought that they sounded excellent on every other frequency and are very detailed in every other range. The Behringers also had all the power I needed (active speakers) and can be played really loud in my studio without any distortion. Except for what I can only describe as a muddy or not clearly detailed low end, I love these speakers. Fortunately I was at a friends studio (a great pro studio) and I saw that he was using the Auralex Isolators under his speakers. He said he loved them. I bought them and placed them under my speakers and remixed a project I had been working on. WOW!! What a difference. It was an immediate difference. The bass is now nicely detailed and that muddy tone is no longer there. I had to reajust the EQ on the lower frequencies (cut them back to almost flat)on the new mix. I immediately bought a 2nd set for my small Hafler speakers. Why take a chance that they were also not reproducing accurately. These isolators are a great product and problem solver that saved me from buying new speakers and discovering that I still had the same problem. ""Cheap foam""?? I don't think so.",positive,,
"Some will argue that these are not necessary for your monitors, however as somebody who has worked in music for more than half their life, I can assure you that, whereas they're not life or death, they do make a significant improvement on the listening process, especially in your project studio. No, they're not going to make your music sound any better, but they will give you a more detailed and accurate bass response when your monitoring. Even cooler is the fact that the pads come with 2 extra pieces of padding that will essentially let you customize the position of the monitors in that you can angle them up or down ever-so-slightly. Lastly, although my monitors fit perfectly on the pads, I can't help but to think that if my monitors were any larger, I would need a second pair, especially if they were positioned horizontally. All and all, overpriced or not; they really make a world of difference.",positive,,
"These strings are very bright and full.  They sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead.  I haven't had any problems with breakage, just a loss of tone over time (seems faster than some other strings I've tried).",positive,,
"As a guitarist who's had the opportunity to work at Guitar Center (back in 1999), trying each type of string on the market was a fairly inexpensive and easy task.  While I'll chose D'Addario EXL's for electric, Martin SP are my top choice for acoustic.  The sound and reliability are unmatched for the money.  They also have a neat bronze shimmer to them...  Granted that's only aesthetic.",positive,,
Ive been trying different strings for years!!!  Ive been stuck on elixirs for some time now and wanted a change.  These are very bright and clean!!!!  very playable!!!,positive,,
"I have tried different brands and weights of strings in search of the ones that would give my guitar a clear, bright, yet robust sound, and I found that in the Martin MSP 4050 SP strings. I knew I had found, &#34;my strings&#34; after a short time playing with these. They are light on the fingers, sound great, and priced right.",positive,,
"Martin makes a variety of good sounding strings, and these are toward the light end.  The sound is bright, but lacks a fullness found with some of the heavier strings such asMartin MSP4150 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Light-Medium.The custom light are easier to play and have a bright tone to them, but can make a guitar sound like a cheaper model compared to the Light-Medium. Some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics. If you strum harder, they are more stretchy and the tuning will be less consistent, changing the tone for the same reason a ""bend"" would. If you play at a fairly consistent sound level you can expect more of a bright sound than a resonant one.On the other hand, compared to some other brands with more of a dampened sound, the brightness can make an instrument sound quite good.Depending on your style, these might be a good choice. If you are used to playing a solid body electric with a lighter feel to the strings that make medium strings uncomfortable, these might seem more at home.  If you are used to Martin medium strings, but want something that you can play for a few extra hours a day without feeling as if you are overdoing things, you might like these too, but when you pick up a guitar with the Martin Medium strings, you may find that even a cheaper guitar sounds better in comparison to these on a more upscale one.I wouldn't say I dislike these, and I wouldn't quite say that those who gave it five stars oversold them, because they may deserve five stars for your particular needs. But as an all around choice, there are better sounding ones from Martin. But it's a moot point if you don't feel comfortable playing them. Make sure to read a variety of reviews before deciding because there are other equally valid viewpoints just as each player is unique.",positive,,
"I bought these to put on my really old Martin acoustic. The guitar still sounds amazing, and these strings certainly fit my budget, and provide a great sound.",positive,,
These are one of the best strings I've used. I'm a blues guitarist so they take a beating well. Very much worth the cost and I thank Amazon for having them!,positive,,
"These are good strings, for a good price.  I have purchased these strings several times and they sound good and last a long time.",positive,,
"These strings retain a good feeling for a long time, well past the point of them needing changed because they've lost brightness.",positive,,
But these seemed to work well on the guitar I was re-stringing. My son thought they were great and he knows quite a bit more.Recommend.,positive,,
I bought these a while ago but just got around to using them last week. I don't ever remember the non wound strings being bronze but these are. To me it looks weird but they sound so much better than my ancient strings that were on there.,positive,,
"Brand name, good string, good tone, seem to last awhile but I change strings often so never really know how long a set will last.",positive,,
"I used to use Elixir Nano string, and a good as they sound, they do not last. These do. great sounding strings.",positive,,
"I've used these strings on all my acoustics and even gave some to a band mate.  They seem to keep their tone for a long time and don't change the instrument tone like some strings I've tried.  Like a lot of folks, I'm not that picky about my strings, but for those who are, this is a good light string that will sound great on your acoustic.",positive,,
"These strings are great sounding, and great looking on the fretboard, because they are bronze. One issue I had, was the 5th and 6th strings were too big to route more than once through the tuning head, but it still wound up very nicely. I would actually say that you might want to get the Extra Light gauge, but it's probably just my tuning machines, they kind of suck.",positive,,
These are the best acoustic money can buy in my opinion. They play extremely well and last a Long time. There's nothing better than these strings.,positive,,
I have a 1993 Taylor which is in mint condition. I always use Martin on any acoustic. I bought the Taylor about 6 months ago and have found that the Medium Martin Strings are best for this particular guitar ... every acoustic is different though.,positive,,
"Fast shipping, great price and most of all great stings, very satisfied would buy these strings again and would recommend to a friend.",positive,,
"Long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out, I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position, WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...Bottom line, I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string.",positive,,
If your not sure what to buy you are prob looking for the light strings. These are a littl ehard to play.,positive,,
I really like the mediums.  They are able to play the biggest variety of styles without being to heavy or not durable enough.,positive,,
"The Martin MSP4200 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Medium  are very good strings that are just below strings like Elixer's except they are much much less expensive.",positive,,
"With a nice clean, crisp sound, inexpensive price, and durable history, I've made these strings apart of my acoustic set. I've got at least 6 spares at home right now. XD",positive,,
I am not a connoisseur but nothing great about these strings.  They have pretty good sound but they seem to die quickly.,positive,,
I've used these strings for quite a while now. They have a fantactic tonal quality and longevity. If you're looking for a good string that last a fair amount of time before dead string syndrome hits... I'd recommend these.,positive,,
They sent me the 1mm (Blue) by mistake but it turns out I prefer that size after testing it out.  Fast shipping.  I play bass rock/metal,positive,,
These are nice and sturdy picks.They sound real clean.I'm having better luck with them on the heavier acoustic strings.I still have to get used to the harder picks for my electrics.,positive,,
"I used to swear by Hard and stiff picks on my Les Paul Custom, but I recently bought a Strat '62 re-issue--and these are TOO MUCCH FUN for fast rhythms with a WAH or Phase 90 (phaser) pedals!!!",positive,,
"Just the perfect pick I was looking for, I've tried experimenting with several types of picks. Finally found the right one!",positive,,
arrived on time..packaged well. happy with purchase...they are your regular picks..will order again if needed. happy with purchase. hope you enjoy em...,positive,,
"I have tried few picks, textured, mallow color, and this bright green.  I like it bright color that is very easy to found, and 0.88mm seems right for me to strumming on an acoustic guitar.",positive,,
"I've used everything you can think of in the way of picks and the Tortex are one of my favorites. I have at least 100 of them in various thickness' and these and the Claytons, are all I need. The Claytons are great too, but there are times that I want a different thichness and with the Tortex and Claytons you can find the perfect pick for anything you want to play. They last forever and have a great grip.You gotta try them out",positive,,
"I bought the .73 mm picks & I would consider them medium thickness. If you like lighter get the smaller thickness or if you like heavy go for the larger thickness. The .73 mm is right for me, I really like them.",positive,,
Love these picks. Have used them for years. Feel very firm yet still flex when needed and last forever. Highly recommend.,positive,,
"I've always used Planet Waves nails but I wanted to try the Dunlop buying me this little package. A very good experience. Durable, comfortable and of a texture that makes it easy to use and does not allow them to slip easily.",positive,,
I know that pick choosing is a personal matter. I choose this specific model because the thickness and flexibility are perfect for me.,positive,,
"I use Dunlop Orange because the thickness is perfect. I hit the strings very, very hard and these picks are heavy enough to get the job done yet I don't break many strings.",positive,,
"i've been using these tortex picks for a few years now and won't buy any others.  they feel great, don't fall out of my hands, and have a decent life span (plus the turtle logo is sweet)",positive,,
Great picks for beginners and pros alike! Go for these thinner picks if you like more versatility in your playing.,positive,,
"I think Tortex / Delrin picks are the standard that others are judged by.Durable, good to gripping surface, easy to identify thicknesses by color.The only way I can think of to improve these would be to replace the black ink logo and script with some sort of raised embossing.Then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better.Take a look at ""Cactus Picks"" to get an idea of what I mean.",positive,,
"I've been a huge fan of dunlop picks for a long time. I started playing 15 years ago, and used the slim, floppy picks for a long time. As time went on and my guitar skills grew, I needed a pick that was sturdy, and wouldn't flex to play more intricate and detailed songs.The tortex purples are my favorite, and they're the thickest ones I can find. I like the soft sandy feel of these. They don't slip out of your hand easily, and because they're so thick, they take a long time to wear out.",positive,,
I like the picks a lot! They are super strong and look like can take a lot of use in a good shape! Recommended,positive,,
"Yes.  The 1.0mm Tortex picks are BLUE!  I was quite surprised at the number of reviewers that complained for not getting a multi-color pack.  If anyone has ever been to ANY guitar shop, the Tortex Picks are all color coded!Anyway, I've been playing guitar for about 15 years.  I've been using the Blue Tortex picks for about 14.  At first I messed around with all the different picks I could get my hands on.  Teardrops were too small; Fender brand were too slippery; Guitar Center brand wore out too quickly; the Jim Dunlop nylon picks just felt too weird to me.  The 1.0mm Tortex give just the right sound on the attack, don't feel too flimsy in my fingers (I keep a tight grip) and the grip on them is far superior to any on the market (gator grips feel too porous for me.)  Durability wise, I'll lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out!",positive,,
"Whatever size you are looking for Dunlop is the best option. It lasts long, sounds great, and feels very nice. It is probably the most favored pick among all companies. I recommend the orange one for beginners, and in general would not go much higher than the green ones because when it gets too heavy it does not feel to comfortable anymore and does not sound as well, but it is totally up to what you want. Either way, Dunlop is the best and for a great price.",positive,,
"I've always used these dunlop picks, I've tried other ones like fender, other dunlop picks as well but these just feel right, I've never like the thicker picks or the picks with the weird grips on them these just feel right when playing, give them a try! ... if not you'll just wind up with a cool little turtle tortex sticker instead",positive,,
"thankfully i still have most of these picks. i'm always losing them, but they work super well and i will always buy this brand from now on.",positive,,
I was looking for something that was able to bend a bit but not fall out of shape or stay bent after much use and these are great.  They have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great.  It's almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these.  It sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers...you don't want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition.,positive,,
"I've been using these picks for 10+ years, they've always been great.  Between these blues and the yellow, I'm covered.",positive,,
"I love these picks.  The flex is just right for me, and they last forever.  I have never had one break.",positive,,
"If you don't know what type of pick you like, buy a sample pack. Picks make a big difference to sound and playability. These are thin and flexible. Easier to use for beginners and easier for strumming in general. However the tone is different. So you'll need to decide what songs they work for, etc.As far as quality, these are great. Easy to grip, and as durable as most.",positive,,
"Good picks, great feel and brings out sound loudly. Mostly for Electrics. I prefer the lighter sound of the Acoustic but these work very well with my friends Electric, Fender.",positive,,
"I used to use a lot thinner pick until reading an article from Paul Gilbert saying that in order to play fast you need a minimum of 1mm. These things are great and yes, I can shred faster now!",positive,,
"Finally decided in getting the 1.00mm picks because I don't like them too thin or too thick, this was the perfect gauge I was looking and hoping for. The logo will wear out in a few uses but I don't much about that. Been using it on a daily basis to practice and so far it's not wearing out too fast. Recommended!",positive,,
I think these are great for the price they give you. John Mayer uses these picks and hes one of my favorite guitarist so I am sticking with these.,positive,,
I've used these picks for years with great results. If you've never used this stile picks you won't be sorry.,positive,,
"In a fit of boredom or curiosity, I decided that I would check out some the other picks out there.  After spending too much money for various brands of picks, including every model of the DAVA picks, I came back home to Dunlop Tortex green.  They stil play great, sound great against steel strings, and last a long time.",positive,,
"These will pluck Guitar and Bass strings decently. If you want one set to cover both applications, this is a good choice.",positive,,
I like it.  Grip is good and the thickness is just right for me.  I wish the tip was sharper but it is good as is,positive,,
Tortex is great i really like their picks there may be better but these have fit the bill i prefer the yellow ones they are a little thinner,positive,,
"The thickness of the pick you use is a matter of personal preference. For my style, the .60 Dunlop Tortex is perfect.  The surface is matte and not too slick.  I don't think I have ever worn one down to being unusable; they seem to last forever (or until they're lost).  I've tried other brands and picks made of other materials, but I always come back to these. I'll probably be buried with one in my hand!",positive,,
i ordered one pack of these and got an entire box!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! either way the picks are great although i would suggest the Jazz picks over these,positive,,
"I always keep a lot of these on hand.  These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars (strumming style & vocals).  Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks.  These definitely last longer for me than other brands (similar weight) that I have used.  For example, I can &#34;round-off&#34; the end off a Musician's Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks.  The weight is great for my style of playing.  They seem more durable than other brands.  They're inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand.  I love 'em, use them daily, and rely on them !!!",positive,,
"I love the Tortex .50mm picks (red).  I have one that's over 4 years old and still going strong!  Yes, the turtle and writing eventually get rubbed off, but they never leave black residue on the pick or the strings.  I use the red, yellow, and orange Tortex's exclusively for practice and performance (I'm a church worship leader).  My highest recommendation.",positive,,
"I love these picks for playing my acoustic. They give such a nice, crisp tone and the perfect amount of flex for playing acoustic. For me I prefer a slightly thicker pick for playing electric, probably a .70 or .80 but I still like the tortex picks for that as well. And these picks are inexpensive enough that you can keep an endless supply.",positive,,
"These guitar picks are just the best. Simply put. They are easy to grip onto, even when your hands are sweaty from rocking out all day. Highly recommended. I will never use any other guitar pick other than a Dunlop Tortex. I use the green 88mm picks, and also the orange 60mm ones. I recommend you buy both the green picks and orange picks. Great for beginners or the pros.",positive,,
"I enjoyed this set very much due to the variety of picks, as it was interesting to try different models. Dunlop picks are great!",positive,,
"As a kid I learned to play the trombone proficiently, but my heart wasn't really in it, so I took up the guitar, which I love. I played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time. I recently started playing again and was looking for the perfect pick for classic rock (I have an old Ibanez and a Les Paul Custom) and have tried several picks in that quest. There are several I have liked (and several that I haven't) but thus far my favorite is the 1.0mm Tortex (blue) picks. They have a very nice, almost powdery, matte feel that minimizes slippage and they just don't break, though the 1.0s are fairly stiff. Depending on what you are playing there are various thicknesses available, and most people will find something suitable for their personal preferences. I won't say that I will never try anything else, but thus far I find myself picking up my 1.0 Tortex more than other picks.",positive,,
i've used pick when i play most of time and i used white color thinnest one. i like to use thin ones because i play strumming most of time and this one works perfect. very easy to grip and last long. one thing to point out is that print on pick fades away very quickly but i do not mind. highly recommand this for anyone needs pick!,positive,,
"These are such comfortable picks... I love the texture on them, which makes them easy to hold without being distractingly aggressive like some of the other picks' textures. This is subtle yet effective. My favorite pick now.",positive,,
"They feel very nice with a soft touch finish on them. Fair priced and I love the color of the green ones. I like the .88 mm because its just the right mix of medium and hard; great for someone looking to play blues or rock. Cheap and easy to use, can't beat these picks!",positive,,
"Great picks, buy it. This pick, rocks for me, im a fan of dunlop for many years and all there products are amazing.",positive,,
"I have always used tortex picks. I like them a lot and they last forever (almost :)these were a little thick for my tastes. The red ones are a little thinner and give better action for strumming and also for fast alternate picking patterns.If you like a medium thick pick though, these are rockin.",positive,,
"This is the pick I learned to play with.Great feel, doesn't slip in sweaty fingers.Good tone, you can get plenty of use from one pick, as they hold up very well!",positive,,
good deal.,positive,,
"I have been using Dunlop picks for a long time. Good feel, grip and not too heavy or thick. Good deal.",positive,,
"I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less ""clicky"" - than a standard plastic pick.  My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these.  I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same, I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point, so I use them more.  But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent.  They're almost impossible to drop, they sound and feel just right to me, and they last seemingly forever.  Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks.",positive,,
I can't hear the sounds of the strings over the flick of these flimsy picks across them. better for electric guitar but still hard to play fast,positive,,
"Ever since I started playing the guitar, I've used the nylon Dunlop picks. They're better in a thicker size (1.0mm or larger) but the .73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular Fender pick. They're flexible and easy to pick with, but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will NOT break. You'd almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it -- so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears.Also of note: the price keeps going up on these here on Amazon for some reason -- don't pay more than $3-4 for a pack of them, as you can get them at your local music store for about that.",positive,,
"I bought these because I wanted durable, flexible picks for easy strumming. I would recomend these to anyone that needs more stable strumming.",positive,,
"I like thin picks myself, and this one is VERY thin. You won'tuse it all the time, but every now and then it can be used in the right situation. If you are a player who is somewhat meat-fisted when it comes to playing and needs to take the edge off, it is ideal. Also, if you are doing very soft strumming on an acoustic guitar, it is awesome. No power chords with this little guy, but it is a good tool to have in the tool box when you need it. The non-slippery texture and it's grippy textured surface of Dunlops is what I love about them the most, it makes them easier to hold on to. I give them a thumbs up!",positive,,
"They're just great.  Awesome for chord based songs.  If you need to pick individual notes/strings, then you might want to go a bit thicker.  With that said, you can do it with these, but the tone is not as nice (sounds a bit softer).",positive,,
I am a bass player so I like my picks to be a bit thicker and wider. I tend to Play with Fender 346 so I was pleasantly surprised when I found that this pick worked really well for me.,positive,,
"I would give these picks five stars, but I do have a couple of other types I prefer more.  Still, these are nice picks.  So far I've only used them on 12-string guitar, but I'll soon be trying them out on 6-string guitars.",positive,,
"They're very thin nylon picks. They're good for practicing the hand motions of strumming; they put up very little resistance, so they train you to keep your hand stable. I still sometimes play with them since they give a really nice bright tone, but I usually want something thicker in order to be able to flatpick melody lines in between strums. I also sometimes use them when practicing flatpicking, since flatpicking with a really thin pick reveals things about your body mechanics that you don't notice with a thicker pick.They're great for what they are (thin, flexible picks), and Amazon has the best price.",positive,,
"These just don't have the right feel and the sound isn't that great compared to other materials.The quality control is so so. The picks aren't cleanly cut out they are injection molded and as a result they are left with a thin trim all around them.I'll stick with Dunlop Gator Grip .96mm or PRS 1.0 picks. For more flexibility or acoustic, I prefer Fender Medium Celluloid picks.",positive,,
"These have been my favorite picks, for decades now. They grip very well, and last forever, and they're a tiny bit more muted than other, more &#34;plasticky&#34; picks.",positive,,
"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career.  I rock hard. Acoustic, electric, and Bass!  I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily.  Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break, and once you find the thickness that fits your needs, you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career.  Buy these picks.",positive,,
"Im not loyal to brands on the whole but when I reach for a pick I hope this is the one I get. They wear out and get nicks so I have to remember to keep ordering them.Edit: Watch the Steve Vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn, nicked, picks. Rapidly,firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet. The motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick, repeat 3 or 4 times and whadda u know! The edge is now smooth and nice.",positive,,
"I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin, but for more chord strumming style playing, such as playing rhythm, the .73's are perfect. They are flexible, but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However, they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So, i dont see how you can go wrong.",positive,,
"These Dunlop 88 mm picks are the right size, not to big or too small.  Been using these for years.  Always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases.  They never wear out.  They are not too stiff or too flimsy.  They work good for the sound on the strings.  Easy to hold on to.",positive,,
"I ordered these because I bought a variety pack of picks from Musician's Friend and there was one lonesome very thin celluloid pick in the pack. I loved how it quieted the strumming on my acoustic dreadnought, so I went on the hunt for very thin picks. The celluloid one fell apart quickly, so I wanted a better material.These white nylon picks should last a lot longer. The non-pointed end is all grippy (textured), so it doesn't work great if you like to use the more rounded corners of a pick, but it does the job and I like it. The pointed end is very thin and slides off the strings nicely, but you can still pick with it if you're combining picking and strumming.I'll keep using thicker picks for picking-only songs and for louder strumming, but for more mellow strumming and to keep from bothering other folks in the house, these are great.UPDATE: I've been using them for more than a year now, and they are pretty flimsy for picking notes in a mostly-strumming song... but you can do it. This is still my favorite pick for strumming. Hope this helps.",positive,,
"OK, so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything, depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However, I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw, folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be.",positive,,
"These picks are nylon, so each one will last you a couple of years (as long as you don't lose them!!) this is thicker than the .60mm, so you can dig into the strings a little better, but still a hair flimsier than the Snarling Dogs .73mm picks (I know, they're the same size, but trust me these are &#34;flimsier&#34;), and the grip is ok. You can't go wrong here.",positive,,
"alright I got tired of forking over 30 cent a pick at my local guitar store for instant gratification and decided to get some more online, and let me tell you, these picks get the job done. don't expect to be playing metal with these as they are on the soft side but work well for casual playing along with some heavy palm mutes and stuff like that. a few of the tips broke off but I think that's my fault for playing too hard :) Great picks, would recommend to anyone.",positive,,
"I use the Dunlop .60mm nylon picks as my current standard,  but decided to give the lighter .38mm a try.  Unfortunately,  the volume they produce get completely swallowed up when accompanying singing with an acoustic guitar (especially in an outdoor picnic setting),  and basically unusable for that purpose.  However, I did find these were just the ticket for personal practice, allowing me to hear a  metronome or backtrack far easier.  So although they failed my original performance intention, 5 stars for filling a need I didn't even know I had.  :)",positive,,
This nylon pick has great play feel.  It is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still feels comfortable stumming chords.,positive,,
"These picks are nice and thin, just what I was looking for in a pick.  They seem durable so far and the light color makes them easy to see when you drop one or set it down.  I'm satisfied with these picks.",positive,,
"This picks are comfortable, nice quality. They'll get dirty as they are cream (or white as I see) but worth it!! Wanna play fast? take these n try em out",positive,,
These picks have just the right amount of give to really make strumming sound nice and clean. Very forgiving on technique also. Great for beginners.,positive,,
"I only use Dunlops. For a number of reasons. First, the texture of the plastic gives a good sound, and easier to hold on to. Second, the ""grippy"" texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to. Thirdly, they make many sizes, for all the right occasions. Two thumbs up! Use these for general acoustic guitar strumming, they are not too thin and not too thick. I use the .60mm, .48mm, and .38mm. sizes.",positive,,
"i purchased the .38mm and these (.46mm).  after using the .38mm and learning how to use the pick now i feel better using these.  i like the small amount of texture provided in the grip area.  not too much, but at least something.",positive,,
"Normally I prefer a harder pick but I switch to these after 9pm when playing my acoustic guitar to keep the peace with the neighbors. These super light flexible nylon picks are great if you're trying to play quietly. If you prefer a flexible, softer pick as many people do these are also excellent for your regular go to pick.",positive,,
ive been using dunlop nylon standard picks since the early 80s. they have never let me down. very comfortable in the hand.,positive,,
I'm not sure what else to say. The picks work well and they don't wear out easily. I like these because they have a nice grip and when my fingers get sweaty they don't slide out.,positive,,
"the are last forever! much better than plastic ones, especially if you stay in the light thickens.  TH ANK you!",positive,,
"The .6 MM pick has just the right amount of flexibility without flapping around like thinner picks. And the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing. I know people use yogurt containers, credit cards, bird feathers and even coffee stirrers for picks, but for me, the consistency of the Dunlop pick can't be beaten. And the price is right, too!",positive,,

"Perfect fit for me. I don't like a pick that is to stiff, and I like the grip. My hands sweat a lot so I really need the grip.",positive,,
Durable and affordable. The .60mm is a perfect thickness for those looking to strum and occasionally pick.,positive,,
"I'm an Irish-style DADGAD guitarist.  These picks cut through the string really nicely, and are great for driving rhythms.  I'm starting to lean towards the Tortex .5mm, though -- I think the roughness on the surface of the Dunlops adds a little bit of scratch to the sound that I don't like.  Still, great picks.",positive,,
"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career. I rock hard. Acoustic, electric, and Bass! I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily. Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break, and once you find the thickness that fits your needs, you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career. Buy these picks.",positive,,
"Pretty flexible due to the 0.60mm thickness, I would recommend the Dunlop Max Grip picks over these picks.  The Max Grips have a much better grip.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.",positive,,
I like a flexible pick and these at .60mm work just fine.  They are also in a good color so they don't stand out too much.,positive,,
"i'm a beginner on play guitar and most time i play strumming in church praise team. when i play faster songs, thick gauge picks are very easy to lose. so i like to play with thin gauge picks. i have used the 0.46mm (white)one and i want to make the guitar sound more brighter. i pick this gray one and i played last friday and sunday worship, it made sound that i desired and it wouldn't fly away from my hand while i was plying fast praise songs.",positive,,
"As a vast multitude of guitar players will solemnly agree, we all have experienced the search for the personal Holy Grail of guitar picks.  I am no exception.  Dozens and dozens of makers, styles, shapes, gages,  materials,  price ranges, (oh ya, the 30 dollar picks), you name it, I've tried it (even nail picking on metal strings).  Now if you are new to the &#34;perfect pick quest&#34;, you must understand that picks are as subjective as scent, with personal grip, sound interaction, a host of music ingredients making your Grail different.  However, if you play a light metal-string acoustic (my main is an Aria AF tenor guitar), check out these Dunlops .60 Nylons.Even within the Dunlop line, I have tried the different grips and thickness gages, and after all said and done, these relatively cheap picks are all that have remained standing as my first choice.  Just heavy enough to be heard unplugged without folding the pick around my thumb, light enough to strum fluidly without yanking at my lighter strings, just the right material to keep my low strings thumping and my high strings singing.  Even the Dunlop Nylon Max grip of the same .60 gage didn't acoustically perform quite the same.Would I try another pick if the chance was presented?  Sure, most of us would since the quest for the Holy Grail never truly ends,  but until then, Dunlop's .60 Nylon is without hesitation the closest thing I have gotten to pick perfection.",positive,,
These just happen to be my favorite.I always keep .46mm .60mm and .73mm sizes on hand. (mostly use the .60's) I've been using them for years and so will probably never change. I like the 'grippiness' of them .... I hate smooth picks.Picks are cheap so just keep trying different ones until you find one you like.,positive,,
"I think many/most guitarists are always on the lookout for new things and picks are and easy and cheap thing to try.  My favorite picks for the last ~8 years are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks - they're nylon picks that have a raspy ""cat's tongue"" surface that makes it super easy to grip.I've also had a few of these Gator Grip picks for a few years now and I like them quite a bit, but they're not my favorite.  I tend to use something around or just under 1 mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic.  These picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them.  Sound-wise I don't find that they're significantly different from any other pick.  If they ever stop making Brain Picks these could very well become my #1.",positive,,
"I've been using the Dunlop Delrin 500 2.0 picks.  Purple ones with the turtle/500 on them.  I thought I had found my pick.  Because they were so slippery, I had to rough up each side to have enough texture to improve the grip (I'd rub each flat side against the edge of a honing stone).  At the music store I stumbled on the Dunlop Gator Grip 2.0.  Yes they do offer a better grip (I think they're still a little slippery but much better than the Delrin 500).  But since I solved that problem with the honing stone, I was more curious.  So - again, they are better, grip wise, but I was very surprised at the difference in tone.  They give a much mellower tone than the 500s and since I'm using these with flat wound 12s on an archtop - the less bright sound often is a better tone overall.  500s seem to be a harder material and are brighter.  I don't know what the Gators are made of but I do like the difference in sound. I'm not sure how they'd work on round wound strings - but great for jazz tones.",positive,,
"Smooth sound and attack. Grips soft, loose, and yet well. I own HUNDREDS of picks. These are some of my favorites.",positive,,
"I've been playing for more than 30 years. There are a lot of great products out there and I've tried a lot of them. I have to say that the feel and tone of these grey Dunlop Gatorgrip 2mm picks surpasses the Dunlop yellow gels, Fender 351 X-heavies, and Golden Gate or Dawg mandolin picks. This is just my opinion, but I hope you'll check them out because I'm sure you won't be disappointed!",positive,,
"It's a pick... everyone has their preference, but I happen to like the 1.14's a lot and the &#34;powder-y&#34; grip on these is a real bonus.  It take a bit to wear that off but they are still good when they are &#34;clean&#34; as well.",positive,,
You can't go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick.  They have a better grip and a more full sound (to my ears) over the Tortex picks.  I have since went to the Jazz picks but these picks are a solid product.,positive,,
This pick is great for strumming. Some people are complaining about the grip but they are better than celluloid picks in that regard. If you are looking for the best grip you need to find a pick that has a textured grip.,positive,,
Since they were named &#34,Gator Grip&#34, I expected them to have a good gripping surface.  That was not the case.  The entire material and holding surface is the same material.  Also they weren't as large as I expected.  They are still usable as decent picks.,positive
"I'm glad I tried these, I wont order them again. I thought they might be a good alternate for my Dunlop nylon picks, not really though.Edit: Im nothing if not fair. My last review of these was in the context of my playing my Strat or sometimes my 335. I stand by that review. However, now Im playing my Godin 5th Ave and suddenly these picks are perfect. Ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars. In the end these are the picks I reach for when Im playing the Godin.I will buy these again. I changing my review from 'Just Okay' to ""Contextually Perfect"". Ok I'll add a star, your right I should add a star. There!",positive,,
"These have been my favorite pick for years now but, I must say that they are not real pointy and I have recently been trying some pointier pick and I'm now on the fence...",positive,,
"I started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing, and it seems to have made my fingertips slick.  So I have a hard time holding on to picks (when I use them) on upstrokes.  I'm sure I could improve my technique and fix the problem, but it's more fun to blame the pick!  These picks were no different from picks without the &#34;gator grip&#34; IMHO.  But Gorilla Snot worked beautifully.",positive,,
"I've been trying to find a pick which combines a good grip, the right string resonance for strumming, and enough stiffness for accurate picking and these picks might be the closest I've found so far for my style of playing. I'm a naturally hard strummer so I want a pick that I can hold more loosely, strum more softly, and still get enough clarity and volume. I want to give them 5 stars but I think that would only apply if they were perfect for strumming and picking - they're very good for both but not quite what I would consider the ideal pick for me if one exists. If I were perfectly satisfied with these picks I would never buy any other picks. For now these are my preferred picks but I will keep experimenting with other brands and types of picks in search of that elusive ideal.",positive,,
"First, I love these picks and used them exclusively for years.  I have dozens of them, they never wear out.  I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band, and never had any issues.  They are very comfortable, and easy to control.Now the bad: the sound.  Not the sound of the plucked not itself, but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable ""plinking"" sound that is audible through your amp.  If all you're playing is loud music, this may not be an issue.  But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics, because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to me.So, too bad.  I think these are great picks, but I'd like them to be made of a softer material.",positive,,
"I got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them. I generally use a Dunlop 1.0m pick, but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play. This, of course, can be very annoying, especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song.  These Big Stubby picks have solved that problem. They are easy to hold onto, great for leads, and because of the way they are shaped don't hang on to the strings like the regular picks do.  Great picks. Definitely worth the little extra they cost.",positive,,
"So, these picks are really nice, but the picture is not what you will get.  These picks are translucent purple.  Other than the strange color, they are good picks.  They really do help with speed and accuracy.  Great for mandolin playing.Updated: Amazon has changed the image for this item, so now the picture really does show what you will get.",positive,,
"I always find it interesting the different opinions about products.  Some don't like the sound, others say these wear out in a day (really -- do you play for 24 hours?).  Some say that the grip is good.  Here's my take -- for what it's worth.  I've listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars.  Round and flat wound strings.  My general take is that these picks give a better, fuller, rounder bigger tone overall.  Compared to the tortex style pick material (1 mm for the tortex).  It's a bit hard to determine if the sound comes from the material, thickness or a combination of both.  Also note, I play with the rounded edge, not the tip.  So the grip in the center of these doesn't quite fit my grip style but it's still ok.  I do find that these get slippery faster than the tortex materials if my hands sweat at all.  I've been subjective in my comparisons -- but this is what I've found so far.  I find that they stand out, sound wise, for the guitars I'm currently playing.  The process of finding the ""right"" pick is never ending and changes over time.  Give these a try and let me know what you think.",positive,,
"These  picks  R awsome!  I have tremmors  in my  hands  and have a hard thime with pick control.....They Have a Gell  center,  Whitch  tingles,  It feels like muscles are activating in Your Hand  GREAT THERAPUTIC PICKI seem to do better with controll picks rather then ordinary picks.These  picks have a indentation so U know where put UR thumb and index fingerThey really Do what they say....If U have hand problems,  try these.....they really work.",positive,,
I dont know why they are called big stubby. They are on the small side.  Way to thick for me.  They do sound good though and will last a long time.  I feel like I am playing with a nickle. I like the indentation. Helps the grip a lot. I should have paid more attention to the size and thickness. Still looking for the right picks for me.  If these were slimmer and a bit larger I would buy again.,positive,,
"The thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one (no pun intended) you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice.  I've used many different types of picks over the years and I've not found the ideal one for me until recently when I decided to use a SilverPick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which I find fits my needs the best and so far it's just a case of getting used to it.  This particular Dunlop pick is as described being fat, stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face.  The hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard.  This makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing.  For me though, I'll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it's not my default or preferred choice for play.",positive,,
"I admit I'm not the guitar flatpicker some of my friends are, but I find this pick to be perfect for picking mandolin.  The picks have almost zero flex to them, meaning the player has solid control.  I like 'em--even if they are purple.",positive,,
"When I first got them, I thought that they were going to be cheap, as they felt extremely light and came in the cheap packaging, but it was ok, I wasn't expecting much from them. The picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material. They did not bend at all when I tried to (and believe, me I tried). Pick wearing is virtually non-existent, and I utilize Alt-Picking a lot in my practices. I actually learned my first sweep shred (D major) with these picks within a day of getting them.I highly recommend for the shred guitarist.My only complaint, is that pinch harmonics are kind of hard to do (becuase of the grip) but i got used to it rather quickly.IMPORTANT!!!You can get these in 24 packs at [...] for only $10!!! Free shipping as well!Sorry, Amazon, but that is just to good a deal to pass on...",positive,,
I have them in purple which makes them stick out.  They have the little cut out to make it easier to grip and hold when I am playing the mandolin.  Already planning on purchasing more.,positive,,
"These picks have a very unique shape and sound that have helped me play faster with a smoother tone.Unfortunately, these picks did not receive a five-star rating because of their price and lack of durability.  They wear down fast.  Mine are usually worn out after a day of use and I don't think I play particularly hard.  At around $4.50 for six picks, these are some expensive pieces of plastic.However, these picks are so full of awesome that I am compelled to pay a little extra.  I will definitely be buying more.",positive,,
"Currently my favorite pick, it's thick enough to control and the etching makes it easy to handle. I'd recommend to guitarists for jazz, fusion or the like.",positive,,
"I first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks. The product description didn't mention that, but I was pleased to receive more than three!My son told me he needed some new picks, and since lately he's been playing Ozzy Osbourne songs I knew he needed a better pick than the standard Fender picks he's been playing with for three years. After hearing him play with these picks, I've noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these. The finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level. My only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks. I wish we could choose the color, or maybe they could send a color assortment. We'll be buying these for a long time to come.",positive,,
"The right pick is a personal preference. Nothing wrong with Dunlop Stubby Pick, but it's not for me. I bought a pack of 2.0mm  picks last year and loved them but left them in Florida when I went north. I forgot the name of my favorite pick and bought these by mistake.",positive,,
I bought these wanting to try the nylon Big Stubby but was sent the lexan /clear purple ones instead. I wanted to mention this because the item description is vague(PLYS PK) and the item pictured is nylon. I'm still happy with the purchase these have the same picking dynamics as the Jazz Stubby but they give you a much larger surface to grip.,positive,,
"I bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect! Then I re-ordered and I got what I think was an acoustic type because they were the same 2.0mm gauge but were too small for me to comfortably hold, so I just ended up with two dozen wasted picks. So just make sure you get the right one.12.5.11 Update: Okay, so I just realized that there are ""Dunlop Stubby Picks"" and then there are ""Dunlop BIG Stubby Picks"" Sorry...",positive,,
"I've been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. They're very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the pick's tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy, sharp almost. After playing a bit, the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually, it really rounds out and you'll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice, you won't care.",positive,,
"How a guitar pick ""feels"", is such a matter of individual preference, that there really doesn't seem to be much point in trying to rate them, as what I like about a particular type of pick, may not be relevant to another player.  Most picks have high ratings, because players who like that particular type, write reviews that rate them highly.  Obviously, the best thing to do is playing with a pick on your own guitar, but that isn't always possible.  With that said, for what they are worth, here are my thoughts regarding Jim Dunlop's purple colored, Big Stubby 3.0mm picks.I like a pick with a sharp point for better control, and the Big stubby certainly meets that criteria.  The sharp point and the pick's rounded edges, help the Stubby to slide smoothly off of the individual strings, which makes for easier picking.  Besides electric guitar, I find these picks nicely suited for acoustic, and semi-solid body guitars, where the string tension is greater.I had tried the 1.0mm Stubby previously, but the 3.0mm pick is much thicker, and heavier, and has absolutely no ""give"" at all.  I'm still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard.  Although the pick has rounded depressions on each side for the fingers, when picking rapidly, I find that maintaining grip can still be a little tricky.  Keeping the pick clean and dry, does help.My favorite pick had been theDunlop 0.6mm nylon pick, but I am very pleased with the performance and feel of the 3.0mm Stubby.  I can locate the strings easily, and be more precise, while still being able to play with decent speed.  Time will tell, but this may become my new favorite pick.The ""pick pack"" contains 24 picks.  I only paid $2.99, which is simply an outstanding deal.  If you're a player looking for a really stiff almost indestructible pick, you might want to give this ultra heavy duty Stubby a try.",positive,,
"I use different kinds of picks, this one is very special, the strings rings out really pleasant, and great for speed picking too!",positive,,
"As a beginner guitarist, a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks, partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully, that makes sense).  However, when I was handed one of these, it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say, now that I have my own guitar, I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed.",positive,,
"I've been playing guitar my entire life. And I've tried almost every pick there is. After hearing how great it is, I decided to buy it. It felt really small at first, and i kinda was dissapointed. I put it down, and didn't use it for quite some time. For some reason i decided to pick it back up, and after a few minutes i came to like the pick. Days after using it, i got accustomed to its size, and I became much more efficient with picking. And I no longer had to worry about the pick slipping. I can't really go back to normal sized picks now.. haha. That's like the only downside I can think of. There are many dif versions of this style, so buy em all, and try em out. If these don't work for you, you can always buy the V-pick.",positive,,
"Real nice Guitar Picks. It came in a 6 piece pack, they deserve the Dunlop brandname because these things last a long time.",positive,,
it's kinda small for my hand but it works great! it's more easier to pick the string. This pack comes with 6 picks.,positive,,
"I've been using only these even since trying them, wonderful picks for speed and precision, you won't go back for sure.",positive,,
"These are shred picks, they are very accurate. Pinch harmonics come easily. The point is made to scream over wound strings, gallops, are a breeze. I gave one to the other guitarist in my band now he only uses them.",positive,,
"I love these picks. Great for lead playing, and with small fingers like I have, they feel great! Nice quality pick.",positive,,
"After you use these the large, flimsy old school picks will be used just when you don't have one of these babies available.  These are the best picks out there.  If you don't have these already you better purchase them now.  Black or Red, the color is the only difference.",positive,,
"just to let people know off the bat i can tell you these picks are small, and if you are used to big picks these might turn you off for a while. But trust me when i say that once you get used to these picks and you start using proper technique these picks will improve your technique rapidly.i never thought i would say that a pick helped me improve playing but it does. now when i try any bigger pick i even use those picks with more skill now because of these picks. trust me if you put up with these picks for a while and you get used to them you will improve or at least i and many other people agree. :D",positive,,
"Give these picks three days and you'llNever go back to another style.Almost impossible to slip out of your fingers, great tone, amazing clarity, effortless harmonics, durable and fast.This pick literally makes you play better!",positive,,
They work good.  Way to stiff and small for me though.  Great attack but holding onto it is the problem.  The slick finish makes it kinda hard to hold onto and the small amount of pick that shows makes strumming difficult without hitting your finger on the strings.  I imagine it would work great for lead players but I'm a rhythm player.,positive,,
"Nice tone, very easy to grip, last me a long time. One of my favorite picks I've tried for electric. Don't enjoy them as much on acoustic.",positive,,
They are half the size of a regular pick.  Bit too thick for me.  Sound nice. Will last forever. Wish I had sized them before I bought them.,positive,,
I love these little guys. The small size forces me to hold it so just the very tips is exposed. They have a nice textured grip. I bought the red ones this time so I can see them when I drop them!,positive,,
I used to use Fender medium picks only. Now for Jazz and metal I use this pick. You will just have to try it for yourself to see if it is right for you.,positive,,
"I have always been a thin or medium 351 style pick person, but when a fellow musician had one of these on stage I was quite surprised at how well it worked. I have used it on guitar and also on bass and it really works well with a good solid grip to it.",positive,,
"Been using these for longer than a decade, and met many people who prefer minimal picks , and jazz III among them. This is the closest to playing with bare hand that I can get.",positive,,
I bought this in a few colors so my other reviews are on as well.  I like the thickness of this pick.  Easy to hang onto when strumming.  Love the tone I can obtain too.,positive,,
"the title says it all. it may take a while getting use to these smaller picks but in the long run you will e happy that you tried these picks. also since these picks are smaller, i found it was easy to do pinch harmonics on these compared to bigger picks, so if you are having a hard time with pinch harmonics try these out.",positive,,
"I bought these and used them for a week before giving my review.If Amazon used half-stars, I would have given them 3.5/5. I just couldn't bring myself to give them a 4/5 so I went with 3/5, here's why:I've used standard medium picks for over 20 years. Switching to these was not a problem at all. Sure, they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems. By far the biggest change was the &#34;pointy-ness&#34; of the picks. The distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing, especially when playing chords. Everything is much more pronounced, which isn't necessarily a good thing in my opinion. It's especially bad when playing clean electric (picking notes or strumming).If someone was to ask me if these are good picks, my answer would be &#34;it depends.&#34; It really does, in my opinion, it depends on what you're playing. From a rhythm standpoint, I don't like these at all - they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me. For lead work they are OK because you can really dig into each note and have it come through.Could I play faster with them? No. Could I pull off amazing licks that I couldn't do with my normal picks? No.I tried them, but didn't like them. Maybe if you typically play a TON of lead work, constantly, these would be the way to go. I don't, and they aren't for me. I'm glad I tried them, though, because I'll never wonder again if they were for me.",positive,,
"I've used these for more than two years but recently shifted to its big brother, the jazz 3 XL. Same thickness and feel /tone, but in a larger form factor. I would definitely recommend the XL version if rhythm+lead work is required. For strictly solo work with easy to achieve pinch harmonics, this one is better.",positive,,
"I bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out.  The ""gel"" in the name sounded intriguing.  These are OK, the colors are bright, but otherwise they're just standard plastic picks, which on an electric I prefer nylon because it's less ""clicky"" on the strings.  These are fine, and if I pull one out of my gig bag I'll use it, but overall there are other styles of pick that I'd buy before buying these again.  Nothing wrong with them, but they're just normal plastic picks, nothing special other than maybe the brightness of the colors.",positive,,
"I tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably. In fact, they were so good that I purchased ten more when I went back to the same music store. My favorites are mandolin picks like Golden Gate or Grisman ""Dawgs"". The round side of the XH Dunlop Gels gives me a similar attack and a nice warm tone. I would recommend these to anyone.",positive,,
"If for some reason you're looking for a pick with a specific color, this is a nice set. The bright colors make them difficult to lose.",positive,,
I have used the Extra Heavy picks for many years but am still searching for that perfect pick. Its strong enough to play metal and some blues style rifts but not so strong it cracks and brakes. I do like the fact it wont turn to powder or fray while playing either but it does wear out fast when playing on heavy gauge strings.,positive,,
"I recently ordered a wide variety of picks to find the ones I liked best. These sounded different ""gel"" picks. I do not like them. Being see through distracts me. They are a little scratchy on the edges. Perhaps a more experienced guitar player would do fine with them but being at the stage where I am still looking at what I am doing - I just can't use them well.",positive,,
"Not too light and bendy, not too heavy and stiff, these picks are just right. Dunlop also makes quality picks, and I have yet to break one of these. They last a long time. I am a guy so at first I wished they weren't purple, but since Dunlop only codes their sizes with certain colors I like them so much I don't really care what color they are anymore. I bought a pack of these picks for much less money at my local music store so I would recommend looking there first. Now please stop cutting up milk jugs and go buy these. Now!",positive,,
They play well and hold up well(never had one break) They are my second favorite pick. But this pick is better in some songs than my favorite.,positive,,
"I actually forgot that I bought the heavy and medium versions of this pick.  It's not a bad pick, I will continue to use them but I wish they had a softer center, or softer coating where you grip the pick to prevent it from turning or falling out of my fingers.",positive,,
For keeping your guitar picks where you can quickly grab them the Dunlop mic stand pick holder is EXTREMELY efficient and useful ESPECIALLY when performing live.Always great products and always dependable.I also own the guitar maintenance kits and the capo.Not one product has let me down yet.My capo is 8 years old.,positive,,
"As I mentioned in the title, this simply snaps to the stand and holds picks. Enough said. It does its job and does it ok for my taste.",positive,,
I love these pick holders.  They're easy to get on and off.  They hold a nice amount of picks.  And you get that rock-star feel (throw picks at the audience).  A must for any gigging guitarist.,positive,,
Holds my picks in place  nicely... snaps on 2 microphone stand firmly...  Never come up short again...  Its just a nice accessory to have and cheap too,positive,,
I have the small version. But for the price of this version is more useful for a few dollars more. I used in all my concerts and its excellent! 100% recommended!,positive,,
"Fits nicely on my mic stand and hold a butt load of picks. It is quite tight on my picks, but I imagine it will loosen slightly as it gets used.",positive,,
"I drop my pics on purpose now just so I can use it more often! It does what it's supposed to do, what else can I say.",positive,,
"I bought this thing not thinking I would use it too much, but wanted it for future use, I was wrong, no more misplacing picks for me. Highly recommended, also fits on my guitar stand, very cool.",positive,,
"There isn't much to say about this product, except it works as advertised.  If you don't have one of these and you are a live performer, I highly recommend you pony up the few dollars and pick one up (pun intended).",positive,,
I tend to drop picks from time to time and it's nice to have them at the ready when the time arises.This was a basket filler when I needed to get to $25 for my free shipping one day but I find it very useful and use it every time I play.Don't know why I waited so long to get one..,positive,,
Works really well! This is very convenient for when your on stage and are switching to fingering style or something. You can just drop the pick in your hands and pick a new one up when ready.,positive,,
This pick holder is awesome. It just snaps on to your mic stand...add 6 picks and start rockin'! It holds the picks securely so if you're performing outdoors the wind wont blow them away.,positive,,
"The mic stand pick holder is a great way to keep picks available while playing.  I switch between playing guitar and bass so I often change the gauge of the pick I am using.  This pick holder is a great way to have the picks available if you change picks often. The holder snaps firmly to the arm of the mic stand and does not slide around the arm. It holds the picks firmly, there is no chance they will fall out of the holder.",positive,,
"If you can't find a container and add your own sponge, then buy this.Keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential.I think this item should cost three bucks at most, and $1.50 would still yield a healthy profit!I made some more from stuff from the dollar which I think are better.I use this one for my baritone uke, and the bigger ones I made I use in my dreadnaughts.If you make your own, just make sure to not let the sponge drip, ie, wring it out, and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood.",positive,,
"Excellent product, simple and practical design,holds firmly inside the guitar mouth and keeps humidity levels in the safe zone.If humidity levels in your area go below 40% you simply need to provide extra humidity to prevent cracks.",positive,,
"Planet Waves humidifiers are simple to use and a great product to guard against drying your guitar and causing splitting. Dampen the sponge, squeeze out excess water, insert the sponge into the holder and the holder between hte strings. Check on it every few days and keep the sponge damp. Couldn't be any easier. I use them all winter long in my guitars.",positive,,
"It's nothing special.  No frills, just a simple concept that works.  It's important to maintain humidity in your instrument, especially in a dry climate like west Texas.  The evaporation rate will depend on the amount of humidity in the air where you store your instrument.So, when you first start using it, you have to be diligent to check the sponge regularly to ensure that it is still moist.",positive,,
"This compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe.  If you don't over-fill, it will not drip, and you can simply place it in your case instead of the usual sponge.",positive,,
"Purchased this to replace the Dampit as a no drip alternative. With the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use. Distilled water will extend the life of the sponge. Overall simple and effective.However, I may have added too much humidity. Was using in conjunction with humidipak to keep them from drying out thinking they would absorb any excess humidity, but I then noticed an irregularity in the reflection of the pick guard and the tone seemed to be muted so shifted over to humidipak only and will re humidify them outside the guitar case.I do use a hydrometer but I don't think it was effectively reading the inside of the guitar, but only the inside of the case.So I think the Planet Waves humidifier works well for its intended purpose, but you do have to monitor that you are not over or under utilizing it.",positive,,
"I have an electronic indoor/outdoor thermometer that shows relative humidity and a whole house humidifier.It is interesting to see just how quickly relative humidity changes inside and outside with that electronic thermometer.The whole house humidifier pumps out about 3 gallons of water a day into a 1500 sq ft house during the fall and winter keeping the indoor humidity around 47%.This makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier. Makes the whole house safer for the Martins.Now you can use a little in the case humidifier like this to help with humidity, but I think you really need a whole house solution and a monitor system.A sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too. Just don't get water on the wood.And don't forget to take the silica gel packs out of the little accessory compartment in the case. Many guitars come shipped with these and their job is to remove humidity from the case.All the better acoustic guitar shops I go to have a big humidifier running in their showrooms.",positive,,
"I thought I would throw my two-cents in about the new design and effectiveness of this soundhole humidifier.After making a few homemade case humidifiers out of things like a travel butter container with many holes drilled into it and a sponge, I started thinking about how some of the cases separate the body cavity from the neck & headstock cavity inside the guitar case and not allowing the humidity to flow freely to all areas, especially the body where it is needed the most.Even though I was getting acceptable humidification in the case I was concerned about the body being dryer in comparison so I went ahead and splurged the 8 bucks on these. (I actually bought three of them.)I crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and A/C in the summer, keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet. The humidity drops quite low, but the sponges remain moist for several days before I can no longer fight the urge to re-wet them. lol.Two great tips in one:Use a regular, more dense sponge, thicker like the ones at the dollar store. Cut them to size and stuff them in!Throw away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and don't worry about distilled water, unless you want to. I can't argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets, but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size, and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced.Don't worry about the &#34;thing&#34; hanging in-between your strings. It will not damage anything unless you get the sponge  too saturated and it leaks. I will either squeeze the excess water out, or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am satisfied that it won't drip.The humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole.If you ARE rough, careless, thoughtless, or stupid, you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out, but I would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen. This would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause.The top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover. The sponge inside is quite small, and there isn't too much room for a much larger sponge. The device is simple and fairly solid. Treat it gently and it will last forever. You can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher. If you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills, I'm sure it would be a decade before anything &#34;built up&#34; to require extensive cleaning or replacement.Keep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re-wetting the sponge.Try to keep the sponge moist when it's dry.I strongly suggest getting an Oasis case humidifier, (or similar) mini sized about 1&#34; X 4&#34; costing around 17-20 bucks.This will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case.Remember, too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp. Too dry and it will shrink and crack, split the soundboard (top) also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive!If you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and/or dry, you would be negligent (if not careless) to spend the pittance to make sure your 'baby ain't thirsty', or worse...dead & broken!Hope this helps!",positive,,
I wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick. My guitar would probably not be happy without it.,positive,,
"This is a upgraded version of the guitar humdifier, The first one had that green stuff that florists use in it and you used a plastic syringe to ad water to it. This has a replaceable sponge, you take it out, soak it and squeeze out excess then put it back in container, would say it gets more humidity out.",positive,,
"It's simple, basic, but I don't think it does that good of a job. This is because it doesn't really humidify that much and doesn't extend very far into the guitar.",positive,,
A simple system for gettting humidity into the guitar, The price is just right and it is very simple to use.,positive,
"This is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole.  It would not work for an f-hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele.  Inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge.  If you use distilled water (as recommended) it should last quite a while.  The top comes off with a gentle press on the sides.  The dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly.  Don't push it all the way in after moistening and you won't have a problem.  I drip a little distilled water on the sponge, squeeze out any excess, and the assembled case pops in easily between the D and G strings, suspended in the middle of the sound hole.  They can't be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings.  I've never had one of these move from where I left it.If the sponge isn't dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case.  When the humidity is very low (30% or less) the sponge dries out in 2 to 3 days even if the case isn't opened.  As with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days.If you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar (or don't want to see one) use a guitar humidifier!  Especially during the winter - heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels (between 45% and 60% is ideal for most guitars).  Air conditioning can do the same.  For especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar(s) is okay.  For many reasons it's always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use.  A humidifier is inexpensive extra precaution at those times of year when temperature or humidity changes quickly.",positive,,
"I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy, except distilled water.  In all actuality, its a really simple design.I like this design better because of one simple fact.  If the wood in your guitar is already dry, you'll have to refill your humidifier more often initially.  i'd rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers.  After the guitar gets ""hydrated?"", I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days.  It definitely gets taken several time between refills, so it's not that much of a hassle.Overall, good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother.  Try not to over-douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar.Peace out and cheers~J",positive,,
Fits nicely into my acoustic guitars. Just requires you to dampen the sponge with distilled water. Luckily I keep that on hand!,positive,,
I bought this guitar humidifier for my Taylor.I received exactly what I purchased and works as it should.This product has been recommended to me by many other guitar players around me.It is a simple design that fits perfectly between the strings.Easy to use because really all you have to do is moisturize the sponge and keep it in the plastic container.Price is good.,positive,,
"Works for me. But It splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it. They made it thinner so it doesn't stretch the strings too much & as a consequence, it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as Arizona & California is concerned.Suggestion to Planet Waves: I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings, redesign the mount, say with a Velcro so that it's still hangs on the sound hall but it's attached to the strings. It's possible to attach your product in a different way because I've modified mine & to my personal preference works without splitting the screen.",positive,,
I have one of these in every one of my cases. It's a plastic sponge holder with holes in it, nothing special but it does the job.,positive,
"This is good for now! Keeps my guitar from drying out, warping, cracking,! For the money it works! Recommend this product.",positive,,
"We all know it's just a container with a sponge in it, no biggie. I bought it to get Super Saver shipping on something else and because I plan to keep an all-solid acoustic guitar at a weekend place where it will sit unused for long periods of time. Jamming it between the guitar strings and getting it hooked onto them feels a bit rough on the strings. But it should do the job.",positive,,
Cleans your strings and makes your fingers go across the strings a little faster.This is a good long lasting product and a little goes a long way.It is VERY safe for guitar finishes.,positive,,
"That cloth... They should have included something that doesn't fall apart.Otherwise it's great. I use it as recommended by the container and it keeps the strings nice and conditioned, but I'm with other people here who commented that you can't really tell how much of the stuff is left inside. Good idea to keep more than one of these around.",positive,,
"I play 5-string bass, both electric and acoustic and love this stuff.  Each bass I have has different strings for various reasons and I use this on every one.  My wife uses on her 6-string acoustic and electric guitars.  We keep a can in every case!",positive,,
"Fast Fret, or at least some kind of string cleaner is a 'must have' for anyone who plays guitar. Because, if you think about it, strings get really dirty over time, and this product solves that issue. :)",positive,,
"There's not much to say about this product, except that it works. It makes my strings last longer. Sometimes I get lazy owning so many guitars, and 20 minutes per &#34;well done&#34; restring adds up. This is a great way to put that off and keep jamming for as long as possible. It's small and conveniently stored too. I recommend trying it out!",positive,,
I have used Fast Fret for a number of years and think it's a great product.  It now comes in a metal can and has a cap over the applicator versus the old plastic can with no cap over the applicator.  This is a much better way to package the product and will probably help it retain the lubricant longer.,positive,,
I really love this. Tends to be very linty with time but it is still a very good product. Recommended.,positive,,
"I am in agreement with others that state this is a must-have. I battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard. This really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood. I've used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard. I rub the entire neck down before and after I play. It makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop, which I suspect is what they must've been using all these years and never told me, though I never did ask...foolish me. Since I've recently gotten into doing my own setups, where I've read many forums and posters have recommended this and I figured what the heck, it's less than $5.",positive,,
"I discovered this string lubricant many years ago and I concur with what most of the reviewers here have said about it although I wouldn't call it a string cleaner although you indirectly clean the strings if you use the cloth and like another reviewer stated you should also use the cloth to clean the undersides of your strings as well.  I unfortunately live in a very humid climate being only a little above the equator and so strings have a very short life here and so anything that can prolong their life is a real boon for a musician here.  I agree that the only downside is the inability to tell in advance that you are running low on lubricant until it actually turns dry but I guess given the price and the overall usefulness of this accessory, one cannot complain too much.  Now that mine has just run dry I'm going to delay a replacement purchase while I try out something new that I've just discovered called ""The Swipe"" which enables me to clean both the undersides and the topsides of my strings without chemicals.  If this works as well as advertised, I may still get Fast-Fret but for its lubricating properties which really helps make playing a lot more comfortable.Recommended!",positive,,
"The name says it all. FAST fret = FAST fingers!  I played over 40 live shows from 45 min sets to 2.5 hr sets just this year on national stages.  My strings take a lot of abuse and slow down with all the sweat, grime, and dirt flying through the air. This stuff honestly works very well.  It is part of my regular arsenal.",positive,,
"Especially for the price, this is a great buy.  The strings on my acoustic were starting to get a bit loud when I would slide up and down the fretboard, and I was noticing quite a bit of lag when sliding too.  The only downside is that it would be much easier to apply this directly to the frets without the strings on, but the appeal is to bring life back to strings that aren't shining like they use to.  I just had to take a little extra time and care to get as much oil onto the fretboard and then make sure I wiped it in/off as thoroughly as possible, which required folding the provided rag and inserting it between the strings and fretboard and taking my time as I went from fret to fret.  Not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing.  The ease of sliding was tremendously improved and the strings sound and feel better than ever!  Take 10-15 minutes and do you and your guitar a favor...",positive,,
"I just got this yesterday so I don't know how long it will prolong the string's life but I have noticed a difference already. It's a lot easier to play since the strings feel a lot smoother which makes this worth buying for that alone. Also, it's cheap so I would give it a shot if I were you. I'm really happy that I ""discovered"" this product, in fact, I'm already ordering 2 more.",positive,,
This is my fifth time buying this stuff! I really like the new container. The tin is way nicer than the old plastic one. This stuff works great and lasts forever! I play daily and one stick will last me at least a year before it gets too dirty/dry to use. One swipe is plenty (2 strings at a time from nut to bridge), then just fold the cloth and wipe clean. Makes moving power chords and soloing so much easier.,positive,
"I have been using GHS Fast fret for over six years and it's amazing stuff, I apply just a tiny amount to the strings before I play and then wipe them down afterwards, I used to change strings every one to two months and now strings can last me a year. It's easy to control home much you put on and one can of this stuff lasts me a year or two, there isn't really any reason to just soak everything with it I don't think, I mainly use it to clean the strings. I'm really glad I found this stuff!",positive,,
Very nice product. Strings feel and sound noticeably better plus the white mineral oil smells really good when applied to the neck.,positive,,
I used this on a bass guitar with older strings and it made the strings brighter and more lively. I will try it on all of my guitars as it will prolong the life of most strings. I like the packaging and the small cloth it comes with. I use sections of t shirts to clean my strings and put them inside the packaging along with the cloth. This is a must for any fingerpicking guitar or bass player.,positive,,
"This product is great, I use it after every session. Keeps your strings clean and conditions the fret board. Every guitar player should keep this in their case.",positive,,
Not an expert but it is cheap and simple and cleans and protects the strings. Hope that helps thank you,positive,,
"This makes sliding on the bass real smooth. It's also nice for cleaning. It is hard to tell if you are running low on oil or whatever liquid is in this thing but they seem to last for a fairly long time. And it's super easy to apply. Even though you're not a pro, act like one and slap some of this stuff on your bass or guitar before you play.",positive,,
"I agree with all of the reviews, but have found another area to use fast fret on: THE NUT. When tuning, the strings (especially the lower wound strings) hang up on the nut which causes the string to pop instead of slide as it would on a roller nut. Dab Fast Fret onto the nut before tuning, and this problem is greatly reduced.",positive,,
"I got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards (well duh!)  Does it work?  Yes and no.  First it did not appear that anything was coming out.  After a bit of rubbing I did notice a &#34;slight&#34; bit of solution (turns out its mineral oil)on the fretboard by the frets.  I tried to spread it out with the included cloth and discovered that the cloth was useless (a paper towel would hold up better- seriously!)  I used an old tee shirt square and spread some of the oil around- but honestly it took me 10 to 15 mins and I noticed NO difference in the appearence or the playability of the guitar.  It says to use it before and after each session- thats about 30 mins of my time per guitar (I general play 2 guitars durning the course of a session).  I do still use this occasionally, but I would not spend money to purchase it again.  Just not what I was looking for in a fret board cleaner.",positive,,
"Let's cut to the chase: this is, more or less, a tight roll of gauze soaked in mineral oil.  But that's exactly what I need to clean and protect my fretboard.  The lubricating feature is just a nice plus.",positive,,
"I used this on a 5string bass. I liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier. My friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it.Her reason for her opinion is simple. This stuff puts out a LOT more oil (or whatever it is) than you would think. This has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hard-earned callouses soft...which when playing guitar can lead to bleeding fingers pretty fast (and did for my friend).To apply this you simply hold the handle and press down while running it along each string, one string at a time. I highly suggest you only use one slide down each string. At first it may not look like anything is getting on your strings, but give it a few minutes and you will start to see the excess oil appear and start pooling under the strings on your fretboard. That's ok. You will need to wipe away the excess, and I'm telling you, if you accidentally get too much, that excess oil may not come off easily (didn't for me at least). Mine left little pools of oil between the frets, and I only used one swipe and thought I had just a little on there. Naturally, this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling. My friend hated that part too, and I agree with her. Soft callouses = no callouses. This is a good product idea, and I like it in theory, and with my thick bass strings I didn't have the severe problem w soft fingertips that she did. Just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you.It does what it says, but you may not like what else it does or how it feels on your fingers.",positive,,
I've already posted about Fast Fret.  I love this stuff.  It's a mandatory inclusion in every one of my guitar cases.,positive,,
The best buy for your bass drum,positive,,
These patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads. Even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most. As far as I can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all. They stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time.If you have a double bass kick pedal I highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company.,positive,,

In writing a simple review for such a simple product there's only a few concerns you should have. 1. Would the adhesive dry out on this and 2. does it wear over time? The answer is it gets 4 stars. It doesn't dry out but I had to replace mine after 5 years because it eventually wore out. That's pretty good! Not perfect but pretty god!,positive,,

I pulled it out further, retracted about 4 or so inches of it. Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button, it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get. The cable would only automatically retract 2-4 inches at any given length. The main reason I wanted this was for the ""retractability"" since I hate having cables dangling around.Working on getting a refund for this item now.",negative,,

"For the price, you cannot beat this little Stanley screwdriver set.  This one features several very tiny standard and Phillips head screwdrivers.

I have several revolvers and pistols which have sight adjustments that have outrageously small adjustment screws.

"On the recommendations of a few reviewers, I tried these gels for my Jawbone headset. Unfortunately, they did not fit well and came off every time I took the headset off.

"I have bought other USB hubs in the past, and they all failed. plugging in 2 powered devices would make them not work.This USB Hub I have 4 usb powered hard drives and an external DVD burner plugged in and they all work without any problems! This is one of the best Hubs I have found.",negative,,
"It's a nice-looking product. It seems like I would have liked it. But...My unit had an electrical problem. I connected two portable external hard drives, one powered external hard drive, a printer, an external DVD+-RW drive, a mouse and a keyboard. Then I plugged it in.First I noticed my mouse didn't work. So I unplugged it and plugged in another one. ""That's strange, that one doesn't work either,"" I thought. ""Hmmm, and what's that smell?""  Turns out, that smell was a hard drive frying.  Once I figured that out I unplugged everything and waited.After a few hours, when I figured everything would have cooled down, I started testing my devices.  One portable external drive still ""sort of"" works. I can see most of the file structure but copying attempts fail. The powered external hard drive mostly worked for a couple days and then quit. One portable hard drive never worked again. The optical drive still works, occasionally, but typically won't boot. Occasionally the printer works. The mice never worked again. And the keyboard was fine.  Everything's been tested on 3 different PC systems and 1 Linux system.The worst part? Those were my redundant data storage. I lost everything.",negative,,
"I used to be a USB doubter - I thought USB wouldn't catch on.  Was I ever wrong!  Without a hub, I wouldn't have enough USB ports to plug everything in!Over the past several years, I've gotten a number of USB hubs to handle the problem.  I bought a 7-port CyberPower Hub from another vendor to use at work.  It's lasted with day in and day out use for about two years.  One heavy use is that I use a password manager on a USB thumbdrive and it gets plugged in at least twice a day.  The CyberPower hub at work doesn't seem to mind.The hubs at home, and even the USB ports on my motherboards, seem to loosen up and not keep a good grip on the USB thumbdrive.  So, when my home hub flaked out again, I decided to get a hub that I know works, and keeps on working, for use at home.The only drawback to the hub is the LED's on it.  They are a little too bright, and not really all that useful.  However, it's not a problem at work, and at home, the hub is hidden behind a monitor.  I wouldn't want to use it in a bedroom.If you're looking for a reliable hub, this is it.",negative,,
"I gave this 3 stars because it does what it says, its nothing high end and doesn't promise miracles, but I won't give it 5 stars because simply there's a terrible delay from when my computer comes out of sleep mode and from the time it actually recognizes this hub on the com ports for the PC, on average its about 15 seconds.  So I'll be sitting there waiting to enter my password like an idiot until the hub is finally recognized by the PC.  And its a really good PC, brand new, no problems with USB 2 or USB 3 except where this hub is concerned.",negative,,
"[Apart from minor issues like stability of the ""weighted"" base, this hub has been such a consistent, heavy-duty performer, while holding its price point (just short of 30) for exactly 4 years, that I've had to award it 5 stars (and order the identical model for my wife).  But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That's fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer's desktop with each start-up.  I'm about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what's going on and whether there's a fix (could it be Apple's latest update to OSX?  I'll be back pending further info.]I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon's picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I'm looking at the CyberPower USB port ""in person,"" I can provide a few initial impressions:1.  It's a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion, it's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to ""fatten up"" the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest ""gripe"": the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I'd look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it's so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there's any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the ""cuteness"" factor; this thing is all business.][4 years later: This ""off brand"" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington ""round mound"" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]",negative,,
"It works OK, although several folks have said that it was hard to hear me.  Not everyone, though, so there could have been other factors.  The thing I like least is that it is hard to put on.

"Amazon continues to ship this antenna with the Wilson Electronics Sleek Booster, and it is not the right antenna. Wilson has told them many times they are shipping the wrong antenna but they continue to do it. This was very frustrating and caused me a lot of grief as I was not able to get on the Internet for a week due to Amazon's problem. I am returning the whole package to Amazon even though Wilson Electronics was able to send me an adapter in the next week or so, but the primary reason I purchased this product was to use over the Holidays where the place we were staying had little reception.  Not being able to use my smartphone hot spot really made me angry.

"They claim this works for Sprint PCS but I got one for my Virgin Mobile MC760 and it won't pick up any signal! In fact it actually makes the signal weaker!  I have to put the MC760 in a window to get a decent signal so I thought putting an antenna on the roof would be better but when I plug it into the MC760 the signal strength goes down! I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it doesn't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive. I tried emailing Wilson but they weren't any help. Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760. I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work. The first one had bad threads and wouldn't go on all the way, the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it. The third one finally did fit correctly but there was still no signal. I don't see how Wilson can get away with selling worthless junk antennas like this, they must get a lot of consumer fraud complaints. I'm sending this useless antenna back for a refund.I purchased a Wilson 301101 trucker antenna, mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great.

It's not perfect, but for the simple task of holding a cellphone, sunglasses, loose change, perhaps your EZ-Pass, it will do the trick.I place a camcorder there to film road trips, and for the most part, it stays put.

"It's a great deal, so i jumped on it. But was truly disappointed. I've so far summed up Motorola products as well really really poor. I own a Razar, wish i could return that! But this headset, thinking it's from motorola would work well with my phone, but no. It's on my belt clip, and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away, signal is weak, and then disconnets. To me that's strange. It's also surprising that this happens randomly, so it's kinda annoying, b/c you can't anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving, b/c you rely on the headset to work properly. Also get the static noise which is weird, b/c it shouldn't do that. especially when driving.",negative,,
"I've used a number of Bluetooth headsets and this is among the worst. The sound quality is low, especially outdoors, and there is quite a bit of static even when within a few feet of the phone. The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside (with any background noise) it was almost impossible. This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear (earbud style). The microphone is far enough from one's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable, especially if you wear glasses, but not as bad as some others I've tried. It does not flop around much under normal circumstances. I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500, which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price, but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250. I've used those in the past and found them much better overall, and worth the extra price.",negative,,
"I used have one of this earpeice 2 years ago and I lost it, so I ordered this since this is much much cheaper than my previous one.Different from the previous peice, this item came in with extremely cheap package and it's sound quality is worse than my previous one.

"Sidekick II is meant to be your one-stop-shop wireless gadget for e-mailing, web-browsing and IM chatting anywhere you go.  You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie, you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.",negative,,

I used this phone lifter in combination with the Plantronics CS50 Wireless Office Headset.  It was a powerful combination that allowed me to answer my phone up to 300 feet away from my office. This lifter fits onto your phone base and lifts the receiver when you press a button on your remote headset.  You can answer the phone or hang-up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver.The lifter came with a plug in mini-microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing.  The setup was quick and easy and the device took up almost no space on my desk as it attached to my phone.I spent thousands of hours a year on the phone and this device along with my remote wireless headset saved me a lot of neck stress and phone holding for hours a day.  This is a useful tool in any modern office and I recommend it to you.,negative,,

"I could not be more impressed. I was highly skeptical as I have been buying bluetooth headsets like crazy trying to find one that worked, and they're all pretty much junk. This thing worked all the way out to the sidewalk, and likely much further, but that's as far as I went. The quality on the other end is very clear. The manual is plain stupid, it looks like they were half way through putting it together when they released it, but on the Mac the manual was of course not needed, just plug it in and it worked without any of the driver install nonsense Windows requires. BTW, I am using it primarily with Skype.OK, I have to add something to this review. There's a fatal flaw in this device. A flaw that makes the device near worthless to me now. If the USB cable is unplugged, but the earpiece is left clipped into the holder/charger, the battery runs down within hours. Obviously a simple diode somewhere would have prevented this, but for me the device now is close to useless.Update: May 8th 2011. So, 5 years later, the device is seriously failing. the electronics in the device are dying. I am having to constantly remove the battery to get the headset to work, and it's cutting me off in the middle of calls. It also refuses to charge, and discharges when not in use even when the base is connected via USB. It's a pity its failing, and I came looking for a new version, but there is none. Should I just buy it again?",negative,,
"I specifically ordered this headset because of the eye glass clip.

"I screwed up; shouldn't have ordered this; it's of no use to me.  Since the real price was hidden in the ""shipping and handling"" it's pointless to return it; I'll just write it off as an ""educational expense"".I actually bought this to use on a cordless handset that had a ""hands free"" 2.5mm jack. (Siemens cordless phone system).  The owners manual says ""...any 2.5 mm headset"", so that's what I bought.  I don't even know where this thing is anymore; I put it back in the little bag and forgot about it.I tried it on three of the handsets in the system; the plug simply captures the line and makes a loud, ""screeching"" sound...  ...playing with the plug, I can find one tenuous position about a quarter of the way out where I can hear audio from the phone, but the moment I let it slip it goes back to the screeching.I can't get it to work on anything else either including my wife's Samsung Intensity (which also has a 2.5mm headset jack; same results), but I don't have access to a PalmEvery so often I do something stupid; buying this was one of those occasions.",negative,,
"This is the 3rd ""OEM"" battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others, it was terrible. I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50. They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time. It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge. Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery --- not OEM. How can you tell? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan. These say clearly that they are made in china. I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues. There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.Theses companies make their money by selling junk, counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it. For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time. My time is worth more than th $10 I get ripped off for. But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers. AMAZON's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth. Well AMAZON, you can start here: Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders, Wireless Phone Accessories and now the OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.I paid $30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit. So it has nothing to do with the price paid. Just dishonest online sellers.",negative,,
They are probably old batteries sitting on a shelf by the time we got them. Not much better than the old ones I was replacing.,negative,,
I purchased three of these batteries and each one would not last through one day in standby (not making calls) before it went dead.  I thought I had a problem with my RAZR V3M so I took it in and was informed that these batteries do not have enough milliamps required for the RAZR.  They replaced it with the correct battery and I have been using that one now for over a year with no problem.,negative,,
"I agree with other reviews... people who talk to me hear a horrible echo due to the mic picking up the earspeakers sound... even if I set the earspeaker to the lowest volume.  I'm glad it came free with my phone, because if I'd payed for this... I'd be pretty mad.",negative,,
"Summary: Stay away, this product sports a very poor design...Pro:+ very low price+ very small and lightweight+ relatively easy to use+ pair up well with all my BT phonesCon:- morse-code like feedback signal - they try to accomplish too many tasks with single beep/tone.  1 short beep, 2 short beeps, 3 short beeps, 1 long beep, 3 beeps up, 3 beeps down.  like another reviewer said,  you really have to read the manual or keep it nearyby to be able to understand what all the beeping means.- echos no matter what volume you set it, partly because this thing is very loud- insanely difficult to open the battery door.  I got so frustrated, I was about to throw this thing out of the window.  For a product that use regular batteries, the battery door is the most difficult to open.  Once opened, you need a pair of tweazers to pull the battery out.  The battery compartment is very deep and extremely snug.  This must be a sick joke by Motorola.  Forget about changing the battery on the go, you need to sit down and have a few tools and a lot of patience.  (for the record: this was my breaking point, i had to return this unit, because installing the battery for the first time was enough of a turn-off)- sound quality is mediocre at best",negative,,

I tried putting my Galaxy S4 in the case and it kept popping out. It seems like the plastic casing is too small for the phone. Very disappointed.,negative,,
A little thick but protects well and the kickstand is stronger than other cases I've tried.The thicker corners also make it harder to slide into my car dock.,negative,,
"The cover fits properly leaving all the necessary openings available for easy access.  It keeps the screen lifted off the surface when the phone is put face down.  Overall, it does all what I need it to do.  Operating the power and volume buttons is a little awkward as it is hard to find the buttons by feel.  I would recommend this product for anyone looking for basic protection.",negative,,
"I received this today and I'm not a fan of it but my daughter is I thought it would be puffier as it looks in the pic but it's not and the one they sent me is pink underneath and the waist band is pink which is not what I wanted due to the fact she already had the sandals she was gonna wear with it now I gotta find another pair of sandals,ima just keep it cuz she likes it.",negative,,
My 4 year old daughter always wants to play dress up. I bought this for her for Christmas and she never wanted to take it off. It is almost a year later and she still has it!! It was well worth the money and has held up this long with nothing wrong with it!! I would recommend it,negative,,
"I wanted to have the title summarize my thoughts if you decide not to read the entire review.  My granddaughter likes the Shining Image Jewelry Box given to her for a birthday gift from Grandma.  I wish the drawers were deeper for holding her many necklaces.  Also, I wish the drawers had a stop, preventing the drawers from tipping contents entirely when trying to remove one piece of jewelry.  My granddaughter is only five years old, so having the background knowledge of knowing when to stop the action of pulling the drawer from the base requires practice.  I, on the other hand, have had lacks of years of practice with jewelry drawers, but also struggle with removing the drawer without spilling the contents.",negative,,
"I bought this product a little over a year ago. Now that I am done with it, I wanted to sell it. I put it on eBay and Craigslist. They had their lawyers contact the sites and have them remove the listing.Apparently in the tiny 4-point font disclaimers on the package it says that the license is not transferable, so you can't sell it as a used item after you're done with it.Total crap !",negative,,
"We got this costume for my son to wear to Disneyland. My daughter likes to dress up like her favorite princess, so he wanted to dress up, too. This costume is better quality than I had anticipated, based on some of the other reviews. It runs a little small, my son is five and the Child M (7-8) fits well over his clothes. The boot covers pull on over the white jumpsuit pants, and the costume can be worn without them. The arm panels, however, remain attached. The suit has an opening in the back, under the hood, for the child to get into it, and the opening has two Velcro dots to close it. This makes it a little bit awkward to get into, and especially awkward to take off to use the bathroom. To use the bathroom, you have to take off the whole top of the costume, and then hold onto it so it doesn't touch a dirty bathroom floor (I definitely had to help my son with this in a public bathroom). He absolutely LOVES the costume, and has worn it everywhere (except school) since he got it.",negative,,
"Have they lost their minds??!! Over 100$ for a costume!! Amazon, you are an idiot. This is an inexpensive costume. It better include a meeting with Tom Hanks for that price.",negative,,

"It takes up very little space when not being used,  but has worked great in making it much easier to movie two pieces of luggage with one hand.My only caution is be sure that you snap the pieces together as they were intended to be snapped together.

And don't ask whether it was me or not who was stupid or careless.",negative,,
"I purchased the X-Lander Military version of this watch (all black, rubber strap).  I've scraped it across several hard objects, and it has yet to show scratches.  I love the compass and reverse display.  You have to be careful when setting up the watch, as it is easy to change the factory defaults on the barometer.  The elevation data seems to change constantly with barometric pressure, but I'm assuming that this is always the case with this type of instrument as its not tied to GPS.  My chief complaint is that the buckle is hard to unfasten (acutally, the tab that holds the end of the strap in place).",negative,,

We ended up stuck with an incomplete toy... pretty dissapointing.",negative,,

"Product came on time, was exactly as described, were the correct size and the correct color. I had no problems with this order. When I was going through the reviews, I noticed quite a few complaints, and was worried. I needed new sneakers and figured 40 bucks was not all that bad for the shoes. I used to wear Chucks until they fell apart, and will probably do the same with these.",negative,,

"My son only wore these shoes once (he's only 2) because they cause so much distress to get on and off, we just don't bother anymore. Why they dont make a  hidden zip for the toddler sizes is beyond me. They're expensive so wait until they're older before buying this type of shoe.",negative,,
They are comfy and flat. I did not want to buy specific weightlifting shoes due to price so ended up with these. They perform well while squatting and lunging though they do have a small toe box.,negative,,

"Unlike what other reviewers said, this shoe is EXACTLY the correct size. I will say, though, the tag on the inside of the shoe has weird sizing information. for instance, it says that my size 11.5 men's shoes (US) are size 9.5 Mens (US)... I ordered 11.5's and these are, in fact, 11.5... I have no idea why the sizing info on the tag is wrong as these do not appear to be counterfeit shoes.",negative,,

"I closely studied the strange sizing chart for this bra, and ordered a size 3 a few months ago.  This turned out to be too big, so I ordered a size 2.  The size 2 was way too small!  I am about a 38F; the 3 had too much room while the 2 didn't even fit around me.  This gap in sizing has me confused but maybe when I lose some weight I will decide to try this bra again.",negative,,
"I have 40/38 DD size breasts but I love to run. :-( THis bra has been my go to bra when running, doing HIIT and Turbo Fire. I've tried other bras such as the Panache and to double bra other bras but nothing compares. My ONLY gripe is that it's not adjustable and at 64 bucks a bra that sucks especially if you're losing weight because you'll have to spend more money on a smaller bra. Get this bra if you're looking for maximum support. I'm actually going to buy another one because I don't want to have only one.",negative,,
"again, i bought this based on a recommendation of a friend, i absolutely hated the fabric it was a cheezy almost las vegas type shiny fabric, ugh also the straps were too short. i couldnt fit it right. did not like the front closure either,, you need a whole day just to get the thing on!dumb design in my eyes, i sent it back,",negative,,
"I bought this bra not with sports in mind.  This is not a 'pretty, feminine' bra. As a large busted woman, I was tired of being disappointed with ill fitting bras. I needed the back/posture support and ample coverage.  This bra provides both--however the drawbacks are: 1)the straps are not long enough for me and 2) It gives you that 'minimizer bra' look. Nice wide straps and it provides cleavage coverage.  You may want to wear a tank or camisole with lower/open neck tops.",negative,,
I don't like Ameribags because they are too hard to store things in and find things in. I do not like their bag.,negative,,
the ring is pretty but just a little to flashy for me the band is not made for small hands,negative,,
"This is a very useful bag and is as described. The only caveat is the leather - it's rather stiff and not very good quality. That said, it's a bargain for the price.",negative,,
It's not what I expected and it is to small. I will be giving them as gifts instead. Thank you!,negative,,
"I like the looks of this wallet and especially the color, and all the spaces for cards and your license.  The only thing I had a problem with was the slots for your cards were hard to use. I had alot trouble pulling my cards out, I do like the wallet so I'm going to keep it and hope they will stretch out a little in time.",negative,,
I didn't like the way the credit card sleeves were laid out and there was no zippered compartment.  It was also slightly ugly.  I sent it back.,negative,,
The card slots in the wallet are too tight.  You have to force the cards into the slots and then they are almost impossible to get out.  I used the wallet less than a month and the sides were already tearing away.  I've gone back to by old wallet.,negative,,
I'm usually a fan of playtex but this one just didn't cut it for me.  I had to return it because it was so uncomfortable on me.  There was no problem with the return.  I appreciate that.,negative,,
"I am a 38D in all bras, Victoria Secret, Playtex, Beyond Bare, but this one is way tooooooo tight.  The cups are also a little too small, and yes, as another reviewer mentioned, I also feel like I looked like torpedo chest too.  I would not recommend. I love Playtex bras but they made a mistake with this one.",negative,,
"Bought a 40DDD. This bra is offensively ugly and clumsy. It has a lot of padding which makes my already large breasts look enormous, The cups are moulded and - of course since it's Playtex - they are pointy. I was stunned at how horrible it looked on. Add to that the fact that the underwire and band are very uncomfortable; they don't lie flat against your body, yet they chafe and rub. I've learned my lesson now. I'll never buy Playtex again.",negative,,
"This slip is not gorgeous or luxurious, it is just okay. I wear them as nightgowns or around the house in the summer. One of the straps consistently twists around the hook which is annoying and keeps me from wearing it as often as I would otherwise. At least it was inexpensive but you get what you pay for, especially in this case.",negative,,
"Needed another slip for a trapeze dress and this worked. I wear a 22 and its a bit snug.  Other than that, it works.",negative,,
"Had to return.  Will have to find a place that sells full-size slips to try on.  Don't use Victoria's Secret, they are way expensive.",negative,,
The pink color was very faint - almost white. The quality on these was a little disappointing as well. The little pad in the middle was way off-center on almost every one. They didn't stick as well as other brands i've tried as well. Would not buy again.,negative,,
"They serve their purpose to keep bra straps on the shoulders. They were what I expected them to be, period.",negative,,
I can understand why this affordable nightgown received positive reviews but it is too thin to wear outside of the bedroom in my opinion.,negative,,
"Truly terrible.  I purchased two of the three packs and upon opening one package I discovered that they were full of pulls that would lead to runs during/after first use.  Next I tried on another pair only to discover that whilst the length of the stocking was fine the spandex/elastic was so weak that they almost immediately fell down even though they fit.  Also, I found them to be very sheer.  I thought that by purchasing the 'fantasy black' that they would be more like tights in color but that was not the case.  Overall, very unhappy with this product and will be returning for a full refund.",negative,,
"At the moment, I can only wear nylons on one leg.The other foot is still wrapped from surgery and will befor another few months.I recommend these stockings even if you can use both.They stay up without garters or garter belts.  No need forpantyhose.  The elastic is firm but not too tight.I may use them when I have the use of both legs.",negative,,
"I have been on the prowl for thigh highs that do not have the very uncomfortable synthetic material to hold them into place. I thought these were it, but I was wrong - I failed to read the ""Elastic leg bands for stay-put support"" part, but I did not give them 4 stars due to my human error. They received 4 stars because the ""fantasy black"" was hella black, barely sheer. Maybe the ""off black"" would have provided the sheerness I was looking for.I thought about keeping them any way, but I finally found what I believe to be a pair of Berkshire thigh highs with lace and without thigh choking rubber involved so I'm sending these Sheer Thigh Highs back. If these are the kind of thigh highs you are in the market for, I suggest ordering a size up because my thighs are small - I'm 5'4"", 120 lbs - and the C-D still dug in enough to create that unsightly bulge at the top. I believe if they were one size larger, they would still stay in place and be flattering and somewhat comfortable at the same time.",negative,,
"Wow...I should have listened to the other reviews. While it looks comfortable-- it isn't. The edges alone are scratchy and the torpedo look I could move past as I've had one other bra do that to me in the past, but after some time it worked itself out. I'd have ignored it completely if not for the scratchy feeling at the hem lines. There for it's being immediately returned.",negative,,
"I have bought Bali bras before and have not had problems with them.  Had under wire bras quite a few times and didn't have problem with them either.  Have worn 1 twice and I was at work and I had to cut out the under wire is was so uncomfortable.  I will be returning the other 3 that I bought.  If I was smaller they probably would be alright, but being on the heavier side when I sit down there is not enough padding on the bottom of the bra to protect the mid-section.",negative,,
I was disappointed when I could no longer find them at my local stores.  Thank goodness I found them here.  The price was quite reasonable too.,negative,,
"This bra has no padding.  It is stiff and a wee bit scratchy until washed with Woolite or similar cold water soap.It is a minimizer.  And it works.  For those tops that are tight. This works!MY BALI INDULGENCE 34 DD AND 36 DD.  I CAN SLEEP IN.  This is not sleeping comfort.  This is for minimizing.The price is super.  My other Bali, and Olga bras cost $55.00 to $60.00 dollars.",negative,,
"I usually wear Lilyette Minimizer bras, but now they do not even make the one I really like.  So I decided to try the Bali Minimizer, but although it fits, it does not minimize like the Lilyette does.",negative,,
"It fits not too bad, but I did need just another cup size bigger. I thought I ordered triple D and that is what this says, but the bras say double D. I took the wire out, because it was pressing into my chest to hard, but the bra is comfortable. If I had the right size, I still would have taken the wire out.",negative,,
"First off it fits way too small. I bought it because I was under the influence that it would fit a plus sized woman like me perfectly. Don't be fooled by that! This bra is not for plus sized women with larger busts. It looks nothing like the one in the picture. The under wires are so uncomfortable. I always buy under wire bras and this one felt like it was poking me to death and digging in under my breasts. The front of the bra sticks up and out (the under wire) right between the cleavage and it is very visible under any top. Getting it on was no picnic. I can usually reach back and snap it shut but this one refused as it felt too short. I had to turn it around and snap it then turn it back. It was horrible and too tight. I tried to adjust the straps and that helped a bit but still my breasts were sticking out (muffin top). Nothing I did worked. All I keep thinking is that there is a reason they show these bras on skinny people in the pictures.If you do buy this bra buy it 3 sizes bigger than your normal size otherwise you will be disappointed like I am. The price for this bra is too high. The materiel is horrible and stiff, no softness to it.",negative,,
Triple D is too small so I tried G...and still my girls are trying to escape....I hate that.  I bought the Goddess plunge in the same size and it fits great.  This is a quality product...just wish sizes were universal,negative,,
"This is the only minimizer bra I have found that supports me well.  I tried another,more expensive brand at one time, but came back to the Bali. I discovered with the other bra, my breasts were always sagging and spilling over.  I wear a 34DDD.  If I don't have a good bra my back suffers, not to mention the fit of the clothes.  The Bali provides both.",negative,,
"For the person who is hoping for a dark blue or dark green gown, I have the dark blue gown, it was the very first one I bought about 10 years ago and also I have the dark green. Those are two of my favorites and since it is an old color, they are not likely to be reissued. I just thought I would let you know. Sorry.",negative,,
"It's difficult to put the bra on once you have these on the straps. Either I maneuver myself into the bra after attaching this, or I just get my husband to do it for me. Both ways are annoying, but hey they get the job done. No falling straps!",negative,,
"This is too expensive for the cheap quality of this product! Because the plastic is so slippery, when you put it on the back of your bra and attempt to adjust it to your liking, as soon as you begin to raise your bra straps onto your shoulders, the little adjustment clip will slip/revert back to the starting point of where you begin when you tried to adjust it. I can see this happening if I were over weight and/or had large breast, but Im a size 8 and a B cup so this shows you how defunct this product is. Furthermore, the company I bought this from here on Amazon (i.e. Lady Grace) has an outrageous shipping cost! This piece of crap should be half the cost to ship but the company charges an unreasonable shipping fee because they make you pay for them to mail you their unwelcomed catalog (along with this cheap gadget) which I threw in the recycling bin as soon as I got it. Total waste :-(",negative,,
"At first, I could &#34;feel&#34; them on my back, but after a little while, as I wore them, I not only forgot about them, but I forgot about the bra straps that I used to pull back up on my shoulders every few minutes.",negative,,
No stretch at all. Are like nylons from the forties. Give me elephant leg or flat out fell down. I threw them away.,negative,,
I thought the further up the size alphabet the larger they get I was wrong they also need to put the proper size chart along with the product.,negative,,
"they are a little darker than nude, but they are exactly what I expected. comfy panty hose, hopefully they last",negative,,
I bought these for my Mother who is short with heavy thighs. The fit was a little small and she found that getting them over her thighs comfortably was difficult.,negative,,
Finding a 32D in a retail store is impossible. Ordered online and the cup fit is a little off. The underwire is a little small and the cup itself is a little large. I guess I'm just the wrong shape. The 32C underwire seemed to fit the same and the cup was a little small. So I guess I'm inbetween.,negative,,
"I was so excited for this bra and when I got the 38D  the wire part fit great and actually supported ALL of my boob instead of cutting in too close on the sides.  The cups were just a TAD too big, and I could have gotten it tailored I suppose but I returned them for a 38C hoping that, being a 38, the underwire would still be wide enough too include all my bits but have correct cup size....cup size was alright, but the underwire was too narrow AND the underwire that came up between the boobs was too wide!  It was like pulling my boobs apart from the center!  No thanks!  Plus, it pushed really hard into my sternum!  The material was super scratchy and uncomfortable, I just wished this worked out b/c from the picture it looks so pretty but the material is awful.",negative,,
"Unfortunately, I ordered the incorrect (too large) size, so I really can't speak to it. I am not saying anything negative; the wrong size was my error. I returned the bra. If there were a way to choose NO STARS, that is what I would do.",negative,,
"The fit is terrible.  The narrow straps cut into my shoulders, but if they are loosened, the cups don't provide the proper amount of support.  You must be the exact right size to wear this bra...comfortably.",negative,,
"I've had mine for a year and here's what we got. It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen. My one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks.Wayne",negative,,

Also, not sure what they mean by tilt, but mine doesn't. The arm extends in and out as said, tv swivels left to right, but does not tilt up and down as was my expectation. Otherwise, can't beat it for the price as in Target/Best Buy etc., these are going for $60+.",negative,,
"I live in a studio condo and I needed something to rotate to see from my bed and my couch on the other side of the main room. Once you figure out which instructions to use (several varieties are included to accommodate different scenarios and tvs), they are pretty thorough.

"Easy to install, with extra hardware for installing your TV. However, my TV had a curved back, so I used the included spacers to space the bars on the back of the TV. I was skeptical of the two lag bolts attaching the bracket to the stud under the drywall, so I added two 5/16&#34; lags, under washers holding the inside edges of the mounting brackets.After installing the Swing Arm wall mount, I grabbed the end of the bracket, fully extended. The bracket didn't sag a bit. I concluded that the supplied two lag bolts would have been sufficient.I've swung my TV out and exercised the various angles available, and found the swing arm not giving a millimeter.I fully recommend this wall mount. I've a few other VideoSecu mounting brackets for wall mounted and floor stand speakers and one for an 80-inch Sharp TV. All are quality products.",negative,,
"Do not listen to other reviewers, screws that this came with are concrete only, there are no wood or dry wall screws. You will!!!! need a stud finder!!!

There is a whole set of machine screws for(my guess)all TV types plus couple of tools that you will need.",negative,,

"You would be crazy to buy here... its cheaper anywhere else.  UPDATE  I see amazon is now selling at the same price as the rest of the world so I retract...Also discovered another negative...

I've owned mine for 6 months, and haven't changed my mind about it yet.UPDATE: The product gets even worse with age. It will not fully charge, ever, and at 15% it goes crazy. It runs all sorts of apps, closes them, types things into the browser, and won't let you use the tablet at all. This may not seem like a big deal, but it is unacceptable. 15% should still be enough to read for a bit, rather than going psycho and taking over the device.",negative,,
my wife was tired of dragging books around she loves the covienence of the tablet and can make the text larger,negative,,
The price of this tablet I do love.Thats about it.First of all the design of the the tablet feels very cheap.Almost the whole shell of the nook is plastic.Since also the home nook button neing plastic sometimes it gets stuck and makes it hard to push.The format of the homepage I do not like.If you want new wallpaper you have to download a picture file file onto your nook same with music and video.You do get the apps hulu netflix and pandora but thats very limited.Whats also very limited is the app store.What a joke.The apps are all very boring and overpriced.The book are usually never free.The only Up to this tablet it you can watch flash video which is basically the only upside to this piece of junk.Either save up your money for an ipad or or kindle fire.I will be returing my nook!!!!,negative,,
"Highly disappointed. I purchased the new B/W touch version of the Nook and had intended to use it for lecturing in class when I need to do it from the book. I didn't know that you couldn't download the etextbooks to my Nook from the NookStudy part of Barnes and Nobles. Why would you call this NookStudy if you can't download the textbooks to a Nook reader?Seriously!I could live with the some of the shortfalls for this device (slow touch response, flickering on the screen when changing pages, keyboard mistypes characters, etc), but not being able to download a textbook from something that says ""Nook""Study? Smacks of misrepresentation, somebody should sue. On the NookStudy web page, it says that a ""Nook"" is not required, it should say, ""Not intended for Nook Devices"". Also, it will not load onto any other hand-held device that has the Nook app, only on a PC or a Mac. They should rename it to ""DeskTop Study"", using the Nook label when you can't use it on a Nook device is false advertising (anybody want to sue?).Anyway, I'm returning this and buying a Kindle (at least Amazon will tell you what devices you can install their etextbooks, i.e. almost all their Kindles, Mac, PC and oh, an iPad!).If your planning on buying this for your college bound student, get them a Kindle instead.",negative,,
"I bought a nook about 8 months ago. I wanted to consider a Kindle but they were not available locally so I was very hesitant to buy one sight-unseen.BN had just released their wifi-only version for $149 which was very reasonable. I bought one from BN with moderate research and minimal hands-on. I have regretted it ever since.Today I said goodbye to my nook library and bought a kindle3. I can't comment on it very much except it is light-years faster than the nook and the interface actually works. I have about 90 books in my nook library, most of which I paid for so I'm a little frustrated.Things that are good about the nook:1. It looks much better than a kindle. While it sits there unused on my nightstand.2. ePub support. I live in Alaska which means it will be another 5 years before our libraries start loaning books via epub so it's not a big deal for me.3. Free Fridays. Every Friday nook owners can download a BN-selected book for free. Most are crappy fantasy/romance books but I have discovered several very good authors that I wouldn't have otherwise.Things that are bad about the nook:1. Awful, awful, awful touch input. I cringe thinking about using my nook with the unwieldy touchscreen. The screen itself is slow to respond, it sometimes registers additional clicks but mostly just ignores them while giving you visual feedback so you wait 5-10 seconds for it to actually do nothing.The touchscreen display is very jerky and difficult to navigate. You navigate the menus by scrolling through them on the touchpad. It will randomly jump to the top or the bottom. It will randomly ignore a touch (there is visual feedback, so it's not a mis-touch). It will randomly click twice on the succeeding menus.Trying to type on the keyboard or use it to look up a word (you need to use arrow keys on the touchpad to scroll a sluggish cursor around the page to pick one) is a test in patience I no longer have patience for. The keys provide visual feedback when pressed. This suggests you can type away merrily until you look at the text field to see only 2 or 3 characters were actually used. You have to type very sloooow and deliberate for the gnomes inside to catch up with you.The touchscreen is the main reason I ditched the nook. It is horribly implemented and makes the entire device borderline unusable.2. Browser. The BN rep sure talked that up. After spending 15 minutes trying to use the browser to register a BN account so I could actually read books I gave up and used my laptop. The browser takes about 30 seconds on average to display a page. It doesn't matter if it's a real page, the mobile version of Facebook or just google search. It will also randomly crash every minute or two. And by crash I mean you will suddenly be returned to the home screen for no apparent reason.Do not buy the nook if you even think you might want to try using it as a browser to check your email while you're sitting in bed reading a book.3. Battery life sucks. Sorry, but it does. I like to read a lot and having to charge it every couple days makes me upset they claim a 14-day battery life on it. I think it gets about 14 hours per charge (minus the 10% when it automatically goes to sleep). There is a persistent charging bug with the nook, or at least with mine; If you have wifi enabled but the device is sleeping (as in just normally leaving wifi on) when you plug it in to charge, the wifi will activate internally as it (I assume) checks with BN for book updates. This stops the charging and it will not resume unless you turn off the wifi and unplug and replug the charging cable.This is very frustrating as you plug the device in and forget to turn off the wifi. The next morning you grab it only to see the cute ""Your battery is too low to operate"" message.4. It weighs about 20% more than the kindle and is noticeably thicker. Not a big deal, but if you're in bed reading with one hand it weighs about as much as a heavier hardcover which means you're switching hands every so often. Heavier does not always mean better.5. Page turns. When I first got the nook it took between 3-5 seconds to turn a page. I would actually press the page turn button when I got to the last paragraph and could finish it before the page turned. A software update has vastly improved the page turn speed (about .5 seconds now) but only when turning the actual book pages. Library pages, shopping and browsing shelves still take 3+ seconds. I have tried a factory reset twice and either my device is defective (BN support did not think so) or it still sucks. This also strongly influences the cursor movement speed when trying to select a word and the speed at which you can enter text.6. Screen readability is acceptable. It looks like the page was printed on a crappy inkjet printer, with pixilation apparent. The kindle is more crisp and darker.7. The included Merrium Webster dictionary is broken. A large number of entries simply do not work. If you search for one of the effected entries the nook performs a search before inexplicably returning you to the book page. I do not remember which letter(s) are affected but it does not appear to be priority for BN to fix.8. Shelves. Shelves are BN's answer to everyone complaining how difficult it is to find books in the library. You can create a custom named shelf and place books on it. It is very clunky and sluggish and expect to spend 30 seconds trying to find your new book and another 15 trying to put it on a shelf. Sometimes it just won't let you put a book on a shelf and you have to restart the nook. This adds another 2 hours because you will be so frustrated by this point you will put the nook down start punching holes in the wall.9. Sometimes books fail to open. This means you have to go back to your library and open the book again. I have no idea why it happens but it happens frequently enough to mention. Once you get a book open and keep reading that book until you're finished it works well enough. But the menus, navigation and overall usefulness is virtually nonexistent.10. It's built on an android platform, which means it's buggy and randomly crashes or stops working. A restart usually solves this, but I keep shouting ""WHY, WHY, WHY"" every time I have to. Although I haven't had to restart it since I got the kindle. This may or may not be a result of not using it any more.Closing thoughts: I would encourage you very strongly to use one before buying it and investing in an e-library only to find yourself in the same situation I found myself. If you really have your heart set on it, buy from a local BN and try it out for a couple weeks so you can return it. I waited for the nook software update that was supposed to fix all these problems. After that seemingly only addressed the page turn speed I was outside of the return period and stuck with this nice-looking nightstand decorum.",negative,,

"Bought a Nook in September 2010.  Used it solely in my home.  Now, it's February 2011 and it had multiple lines running vertically on the screen.  Customer service is terrible, routes your calls to all the garbage 3rd world countries of the world.  Can't undersand them and they run you through all the tier-1 support questions for an hour.  Still gets you no where.  Finally got a return label but I hear that they send you a refurb item back.  Great.I only bought the Nook over the Kindle because the Nook supports DRM (free downloads from libraries and what not), but Kindle has better controls.  I will find another ereader than supports DRM and eat the cost myself.  Maybe get an extended warranty?",negative,,

"I bought this product used from a coworker's daughter who was phenomenally underwhelmed by it. It is heavy and slippery. The capacitive touch is not perfect, and the narrow metal rim of the screen ensures one ends up touching the screen and changing things inadvertently. There is only one option for a page turn; lefties beware. The battery life is far shorter than the time necessary to read a medium length book, and the plug-in is at the bottom of the unit. Since the cable is specific to the NC, I hated to risk bending/breaking it as I can imagine it is pricey to replace so plugging in the unit usually meant it was time to put the unit down for a LONG time while it recharged. I traveled with this unit, and it did not get me from one airport to the next on a charge. A lot of the ebooks I own are in .pdb format, which B&N sells, but the NC does not read. I was having problems with the unit not doing the motion side-turn and read thingy, and B&N pretty well ignored me. The local manager reminded me that used units are no longer subject to help. (The concept of the unit being less than 4 months old when it died, and turned on twice before I bought it, didn't bear any weight.) A local computer repair guy charged me $60 for absolutely no help at all; apparently the NC is far too complicated for anyone but a B&N repair person which never bodes well. Now the unit, fully charged, will not turn on at all; again, no help at the forum. Since for $40 more one can buy a ViewSonic gTablet with 10"" Multi-Touch LCD Screen, Android OS 2.2 and download reading apps for it, I'd say forget the Nook Color.",negative,,
"I've had the Nook e-reader for less than 18 months. It's been ailing for at least 12 of those months. At first, it wouldn't start up for no apparent reason. I'd get crazy messages and images on the screen, but no access to function. I went online to see if other buyers had the same problems and possibly solutions. They did. Lots of complaints and a few helpful suggestions. The things I had to try were a nuisance but they worked when I was persistent. I learned to fuss around and get the thing started. Then the charger started failing. I'd have to position it a certain way and weight it down when it was attached to the NOOK. That worked for awhile. After awhile, it seemed clear that something was wrong with the connection so I bought a Nook-compatible charger from Amazon. Good news. It worked. Bad news. It worked for only a week. I called Nook Customer Service. They said I really needed a Barnes & Noble brand charger. So I laid out another $15 or so. That charger worked for about 3 days.Now the EEG for my Nook has flat-lined. No web advice and no Customer Service advice helps. However, in my last conversation with B&N;, they told me to take it into a B&N; bookstore and have them look at the device. This will be my last ditch effort. If further measures require an investment of more than 10 cents, I'll tell them to pitch it in recycle.I wouldn't have hung in nearly as long if it hadn't been for a NOOK game I'm addicted to and can get nowhere else. Time for online-game-rehab, I guess. I will never buy another Nook. As my kids would say, it's a P**** Of S***.Barbara Cox",negative,,
"When rooted, this is an amazing device, with a powerful CPU that can be over clocked past the normal over clock speed of 1300 Mhz and way past the typical 800 Mhz speed with only less of a battery life and no other ill effects. You will have to download the typical angry birds and fruit ninja games as apk files, but when you do, this device will shine. Other recommendations are tank hero, and Jet Car, and Jest Car Lite (the Lite version has levels that the full version does not even have!).",negative,,
"A decent color e-reader, but pretty much worthless for internet use. The thing will only connect in the B&N store. Apparently it's extremely finicky about the wi-fi hub that it will connect to; meaning most wi-fi hotspots will not work. There's lots of online discussion of this defect in the color's design. I bought mine last summer. And now you have the option of the Kindle Fire. But I've just been reading that some of its new owners are having trouble with wi-fi, too. So, apparently there's no free wi-fi lunch with these relatively inexpensive Android e readers.",negative,,
"Yesterday I spent over an hour playing with a real Nookcolor at my local B&N;, where I've befriended the staff as I go there almost every day as an unemployed.  Anyway, I was very dissapointed at this iteration of the Nook.First off, the Nookcolor is very heavy.  I think it's almost 1 pound, and since it's not a true tablet, you're supposed to hold it in one hand, but it'll strain your hand muscles after a few minutes.  Even the B&N; guy told me to hold it with TWO hands. That's pretty pathetic, I must say. The only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support, which obviously is not convenient for a device that's primarily an e-book reader.Second, even though it's much faster than 1st- and 2nd-generation Nooks, it is still slow, especially when browsing the web.  Now, page turns are generally faster, but there is no animation, and sometimes there *is* a slight delay so you're never sure if the device registered your turn gesture.  Very annoying.Third, the screen is high-res but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles.  I think the resolution is 1024x600, and the DPI is in the high 100's, but overall I felt the screen looked coarse.  I guess for this price, they have to pick some cheapo screen, so no surprise there.  The color LCD screen, of course, draws down battery pretty quick, a fact even the B&N; staff acknowledges readily.  Also, the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlight.Speaking of the screen, the digitizer is not very responsive, whether you want to zoom in or out or type something.  It's slightly better than my 4th-gen iPod touch but that's still a very frustrating experience.Fourth, the software is still buggy.  The demo unit in store had a few books, but half of them could not open, with some mysterious error message.  The web browser could not render several web sites I tried.Fifth, the interface is very confusing.  There is the hard nook button, there is some kind of drawer button on the screen.  After an hour I still found myself tapping the wrong button to do something.  Very dumb.Sixth, of course, you cannot access the Android Marketplace app store, at least without jailbreaking this.  Very few apps are available and there is no indication B&N; will allow more aps, since they wnat to use this sell e-books, which carry fat margins and have super-enriched Amazon and its founder.In short, this is a disappointing device, not the least because its hefty weight and barely useable screen are just ridiculous for an e-book reader.The list price is $249.99 and B&N; does offer a 30-day money back guarantee if you buy it from them.",negative,,

"Unboxed the Nook. Charged it up. Won't connect to my Wifi network when three laptops in my house will. And it won't work at all until you register it. Posts on the Internet say its a complex technical issue. I'm calling the B&N; tech people. If they can't fix it fast then this thing is going back. I didn't sign up for hours of struggling with Nook's technical problems. I have better things to do.Update: Customer service didn't help. Took it to Barnes & Nooble Store but the battery had drained in less then a week so they couldn't look at it. I figured if the battery can't hold a charge for that long than I didn't want the device. The seller agreed to take it back for a restocking fee and I had to pay for shipping. This thing cost me time and money, a bad experience all  around. I'll never buy a B & N product again, certainly not from a third party seller.  I've ordered a Sony reader directly from Sony. Hopefully I'll have better luck",negative,,

"No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service.  I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",negative,,
"Received this as a gift last Christmas (11 months ago). Manual claims that at a typical rate of reading, one should be able to use it for a month on one charge. My battery already lasts only 2 - 2 1/2 hrs on one charge before the unit won't start due to a low battery level, requiring recharging. This is either a false claim on the part of B & N or else the batteries they use are of exceedingly poor quality. I've used hundreds of rechargeable batteries of various brands and technologies over the years; if this thing suffers from a battery problem, then the batteries in these devices are on par with the cheapest quality / lemon nicad rechargeables I use to encounter 25 years ago.

"When attempting to live chat with their customer service, I was ignored 3 times where the other agent never responded and then the chat timed out, and had the session terminated 3 times for some unknown reason right after their standard ""it's not really broken"" response was written.

Maybe I was just really unlucky and the person I talked to was angry or planning on quitting or something, but I still find it unacceptable.Seriously, go with a kindle or something else instead. Amazon's customer service has always been well above average for me.",negative,,

"A very easy replacement for a 5th gen ipod 30G HD.  I purchased the ipod on ebay knowing it was damaged.  It had the ""sad ipod face"" screen of death.  I could hear the HD trying to spin up, but not reading properly.  If you have that indication, all you need is this HD!The repair was easy.  Carefully pry apart the ipod with a small flat screwdriver and remove the smaller connector.  The ipod can now be placed on a table with both pieces open.  Next, remove the bad HD by unplugging the ribbon cable ON THE HD SIDE.  Make sure to note the orientation of the HD as it will only work one way...easy to put the replacement HD in ""backwards"".  Replace with the new HD.  The only trouble I had was the cable would not stay in the HD for some reason.  I had to use a piece of tape to secure the cable to the HD so it wouldn't come out.  Next, using a small pair of needle-nose pliers, grip the small ribbon cable gently, and push it back into it's slot.  Finally, carefully hold the HD in place and re-attach the two ipod pieces.Now you will have to restore to factory settings.  There are resources on the net for this...I just started up iTunes and plugged in the ipod.  After a few min. iTunes reconized that the ipod needed to be restored.Good luck!",negative,,
"My iPod video had hard drive failure.  I used iFixit instructions and this drive to make it work.Make sure you plug the cable in the right way.  Drive is shielded on both sides unlike the original so you have to look carefully.  If you get it wrong, iPod will tell you there is battery failure, but there isn't, it's just the drive in backwards.  I flipped it around and it worked, no harm done.",negative,,

"The advertisment for this DVD on Amazon was incorrect.  The ad stated that the DVD was in Wide Screen Anamorphic format.  The DVD was not in this format, it was standard Pan and Scan, and it was a poor quality transfer from the film.  I thought about returning it, but decided to give it as a gift.  Motion Pictures that are filmed in anamorphic, or 2.35 to 1 format should only be transfered to a DVD in this format.  The people that make the decision to use pan and scan to fill a standard television are ill advised, and poorly educated to artistic principles.",negative,,

"This product appeared to be high quality and well made.  It also has the feature that turns on the iPad when the cover is opened.The Moleskin does have a very nice, luxurious feel.For me, it was just too heavy.  Not in pounds, but when you hold an iPad up for a few hours, a few ounces can make a big difference.There is another iPad cover sold on Amazon that is a big seller, at around $20+, made of a synthetic material.  It is much lighter, and also turns on when opened.I hate to pass on higher quality and probably longer lasting, but this Moleskin cover was just too tiring for me.",negative,,
"The Dell Axim X30 624 Mhz was released in 2004. It still has a lot going for it; it's sleek, compact, and attractive, it's got Bluetooth and WiFi, and a 624 Mhz processor (the fastest processor available then). But I can't imagine why anyone would want to buy this outdated model, especially since the price listed here for a brand new unit is higher than what it retailed for in 2004. It uses Windows Mobile 2003 (WM v4), which isn't supported by MS anymore. The current version of Windows Mobile is 6.1.Additionally, Dell has discontinued the Axim X30 since 2007. You will have trouble getting support from Dell if you run into any problems.But complaints about it being outdated aside, the Dell Axim X30 has a few significant problems with it:1) A problem commonly reported is the backup battery going bad or burning out. There is no way to replace it unless you want to venture into cracking the case open and soldering the right kind of battery on.2) A lot of users, like myself, have the problem with the built-in storage spontaneously disappearing. The PPC doesn't ""see"" the drive anymore; it's like it doesn't even exist.3) Activesync frequently fails to sync some task and calendar items.4) Pathetic battery life. I can squeeze about 2.5 hours from the battery it comes with - and that's with Bluetooth ans WiFi turned off and the screem dimmed down.5) On my X30, the power/data connector completely broke loose.I would advise you to pass this up.",negative,,

"I used to date this girl who loved Scrabble.  So, by association, I had to as well!  We used to play a lot - even with her Grandmother.  What they did, however, was ""cheat"".  We had one of these - this same Franklin Spelling Corrector you see here (an older model but same nonetheless) and you each of us was allowed to use it to come up with all kinds of crazy words.  I thought this was a dumb way to play Scrabble, at first, but then I came to love it.  If you're all ""cheating"", then it becomes a different game - the strategy changes.  We had a lot of fun.  Too bad I had to dump her for being utterly insane! (I'm sure she was bipolar-scitzophrenic or some variant thereof).  I kept the Franklin Spelling Corrector!  Still have it to this day!",negative,,

Had my doubts that this would hold a 300 page paper back book because it's kinda thick and therefore stiff... NO Problem and the adjustable part of this holder is that the two parts that actually hold the book swivel so you can move them in or out to accommodate the size of book.... SIMPLE  BIG BOOK or small book it holds them all and the design allows for easy page turning.  I am using it to take notes for study.  Bought a much bigger holder at twice the expense and returned it... could not turn the pages.  This is a winner,negative,,
"I'm very disappointed in this device. It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides.  The only thing it has going for it is portability.  It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback, it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions.  Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again.  I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them.  For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it.",negative,,

"This is as described but for some reason, I was still expecting it to be a little larger. I purchased it with the intention of using it when making my daughter's lunch - cutting cheese slices, sandwiches, cucumbers, etc.  It's the perfect size for what I wanted.

Got this for my daughter for Christmas (2 year old) and she loves it.  She's at the age where putting things in to boxes and taking them out can occupy her for some time.

These are OK if you are doing something that has liquid.  I have tried small amounts of hard things and they don't seem to blend or chop without a lot of side scraping.,negative,,
I bought this item specifically for grinding spices and herbs for indian cooking. It does a fairly decent job with the spices although you need to have at least 1/4 cup for it to work well. As to the herbs perhaps I'm doing something wrong but it did not do as well. The herbs that were above the blade stayed put and it took a lot of scraping the bowl to get them chopped up. An addition of something solid (perhaps an onion or a some butter) would probably take care of the problem but just the leaves on their own give this processor a hard time.,negative,,
Bought this as a gift for my daughter in law. She has used it a few times and loves it.,negative,,
"I purchased this in advance for what I knew was going to be a lot of food prep Labor Day Weekend.I was so certain of the Cuisinart brand name that I threw out the boxes and other packaging and the damned thing didn't work.

It was probably the single biggest waste of $30 I have ever made and the entire thing ended up in the trash and I spent 4 hours chopping vegetables by hand.",negative,,
"I find it a little difficult to get the get the consistency I want.  Some things get liquefied if the chunks are too big and I want to try for a little smaller.  What I wind up with is liquid -- but still with some chunks in it!  That, for me is not too bad; I just wanted it for small amounts where hand slicing/chopping wouldn't do the job.  I have had the Cuisinart Mini-Prep for three-and-a-half years and used it again, tonight, for the first time in two years!  Then I remembered why I had not used it.  The parts have too many small grooves and recesses which just do not wash cleanly -- easily.  After brushing and scrubbing the disassembled parts I find that to get off all the small smears of food I have to resort to Q-Tips to get the numerous little, tight angles and grooves clean.  It's a  hygiene horror!",negative,,
It works well but is a little smaller than I had expected.  This is my fault and not the fault of the machine,negative,,
Seems to be a solid blender. I was worried about the negative reviews but after using it myself I am convinced that those were user errors. There is a possibility that the glass jar is not correctly placed on the base which could lead to accelerated wear of the plastic connectors. This should not happen with a bit of care. Only bit of criticism that I have is that the blender could be slightly faster and blend more foamy.,negative,,
"For this money I didn't expect the glue under the button names to peel up within a week. and I certainly didn't expect the base to cause messy leaks despite repeatedly replacing the gaskets. And now, after less than two years the motor has burned out! Shame on you Cuisinart!",negative,,
"I'd lower my number of stars, but can't because this is an edit of a previous review.  I had this blender for four years (an admittedly long time, but I used it very rarely).  I noticed after a year or so that there were fine black plastic bits on the base of the blender.  After a few more years of use the plastic mechanism in the base of the unit that spins the blades split in two.My husband and I were going to throw it in the trash, but then felt a wave of guilt about how in our consumeristic culture we never repair things anymore, etc.  So he went online and ordered the broken part for $[...].  When he tried to replace it we realized that an interior screw had become stripped and it was impossible to remove the broken piece.  THEN we threw it in the trash and bought an Osterizer, which doesn't have any plastic moving parts.",negative,,
This blender sucks! It does not work!  Everything just sits there and I have to use a spoon every few seconds to mix it up.  DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER! It will save you time and a headache you if buy a different one.,negative,,

"This is a great blender that's gotten a bad rap. I've owned this model for years and it outperforms all others for my specific task: pureeing Progresso's Manhattan Clam Chowder. The ice crushers don't liquefy the clam pieces. The Cuisinart purees their little hearts out. The mechanical construction is still the Achilles heel but if I can get 2-3 years daily service for 59 bucks, I'm good.Btw, Progresso Manhattan Clam Chowder is a watery mess from the can. Once it's throughly blended, like a shrimp bisque, it's a world class soup. I'd put it up against anything in a top restaurant. I've had one can a day for twenty years. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for other Progresso soups (they're already too thick). Another stroke of genius: blending pea soup with vegetable soup, but this only works for mid-price restaurant soups.",negative,,
"Read other reviews.  The drive on this unit fails.  I probably used this blender only around 10 times over the past year, and now its broken.Do not buy.",negative,,
"This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry), we did not have ""proof of purchase"" and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer ""service"" again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service.",negative,,
"I had used this blender for blending &quot;soft&quot; drinks like shakes and smoothies without ice, but after using it ONCE for blending with frozen strawberries, the plastic part that drives the blender mechanism broke.  It's made of a hard plastic and not a softer plastic that has some give to it as many other blenders do.  This is definitely not something I would expect from Cuisinart.  Very disappointed.",negative,,
"I'd formerly written that I'd sent the base for this blender back to Cuisinart for repairs, not once, but twice, after the plastic gears broke blending *liquids*.  Liquids! Not even thick sauces or heaven forbid ICE -- despite the advertisement of this item as a ""bar blender.""Well, guess what? It broke again, when blending a thin soup.  I'm not going to waste any more money sending this thing back to Cuisinart and will have to think twice about buying appliances from Cuisinart again.",negative,,
"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart, plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice, repackage the unit, deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again, why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later.",negative,,
"Unreliable and hard to clean.I took full advantage of the warrantee on this coffeemaker. With a only 6 months of service, the grind mechanism bound and couldn't be removed. Cuisinart replaced under the warrantee (I did have to pay shipping charges!) Less than a year later a repeat performance. Again, I paid shipping and Cuisinart replaced the machine. Well you know what happened!  The third one just went in the trash as the warrantee expired two months ago.The machine was always difficult to clean - so know I am online to look at Melita's!",negative,,
"I have had one of these for about 10 years.  It is still running.  It still works fine.  But, I will be replacing it soon with an electric machine that is self-contained for a number of reasons.This machine only makes soft serve ice cream.  In order to get the density that we are accustomed to in purchased ice cream the soft serve ice cream has to be dispensed into another container and then frozen for at least an hour, preferably overnight.  Be certain to start with a very cold base ice cream, or the ice cream will not even reach a soft serve state.This machine is not quiet.  It makes much more noise than it would appear capable of generating.In order to be able to make ice cream the freezer compartment needs to be solidly frozen.  How long this takes is dependent on how cold your freezer is inside.  I usually put mine in the night before I plan to use it.  I also make my ice cream base the day before so that it will be completely cold when it enters the ice cream canister.If you plan to add nuts or fruit to your ice cream do this after the base has reach a soft serve state to keep the nuts and fruits from getting broken up to fine, unless that is your intention.If you make ice cream, sherbet, or sorbet infrequently this machine will suit your need.  If you don't currently make ice cream at home and just want to try to make ice cream to determine if a machine will get used, this item would also make sense.  However, if you are an experienced ice cream maker, and expect to use an ice cream maker frequently I would suggest investigating the models that chill the bowl on their own (without you having to put something into your freezer overnight).",negative,,
"I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock, and was so disappointed I returned it. It made sherbet (milk-based) with no problem at all, but I've really been craving sorbet, and the freezer bucket simply wasn't cold enough to do the job--it chilled my mix, but didn't even turn it to slush before it had warmed... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours, only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up.",negative,,
"I asked my husband to buy this machine for me for Christmas instead of jewelry, and have no regrets!  I love all the sorbets, ice milks and ice creams that we can make.  It is simple to use, and the results taste great!My only complaint is how loud the machine is.  I can't really let the machine run while we are having dinner unless I put the ice cream maker far away from the kitchen and dining room.  But other than that inconvenience, I can't complain.I would agree with the other reviewers -- use cold ingredients, and start your ice cream as soon as you take the bowl out of the freezer.  I let my bowl freeze for at least two days before using it.  I put it in a plastic bag, and then put a zip-loc bag of ice in the container just to be sure.I have a hard time using all of the egg yolks and heavy cream to make true ""ice cream"" (although a splurge once in awhile isn't a bad thing!).  I try to stick to the lower fat recipes.  You can find endless recipes and ideas on the internet.  I must admit that when in a hurry I just throw together some milk, half and half, real mexican vanilla, sugar, and a pinch of salt (no recipe here, just taste it to your own creaminess and sweetness level) to make ice cream for dessert.  It's like having fresh soft serve.  Yum!If you would like your own ice cream maker, you can't go wrong with this machine!",negative,,
"This made ice cream fast, but not impressed with the recipe or how the ice cream froze on the sides of the bowl while making it. It was so hard it was the impossible to get out of the bowl. I'm going to try again but seriously thinking of sending it back.",negative,,
"Lets start by saying I hate gadjets, took me years to buy a food processor. But my sister is on chemo, and I found out she dislikes the taste of commercial ice cream, even the expensive stuff. SO I bought this , and made a batch of strawbeerry, an instant hit.the machine is easy to use,and it arrived in the mail in one day!! I followed all the reviews that said ""chill everything"" be careful not to over fill, it makes a bit of mess, and have nice strawberry ice cream , and the bowl is cold in six hours, so I will make peach tonight.I can see this machine is a winner, sorbet and fresh fruit ice cream, with less sugar and no preservatives will capitvate us all summer.( and four sessions of chemo).oh, I borrowed the ben and jerrys book from the library, and now need a copy, its easy and not confusing at all. I love to cook, but don't need complicated cooking with a sick sister.**** for fathers day I made a 1/2 batch of strawberry ice cream, prechilled the cream mix, added strwberries the last 2 minutes and we had perfect  ice cream out of the mixer.***so PRECHILL THE CREAM BASE, AND ADD FRUIT AT THE LAST SECOND AND DO NOT OVERLOAD THE MACHINE.",negative,,
"My first reaction is very negative.  If the bowl is to be stored in the freezer in a plastic bag, why doesn't the bowl come in such a bag??My old automatic freezer, pre 1999, came with a very heavy duty bag for such storage.Maybe a gallon ziplock will work???",negative,,
"I had never known of an ice cream maker that did not require either turning the crank manually until your muscles ached, or plugging it up and listening to the awful whirring, grinding, squawking sound of the electric type. Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise, no mess,  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers, you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts, which is just enough for one starving person, or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web.",negative,,
My timer finally quit working after FIFTEEN years so I'm ordering another one from Amazon---my Home Depot store doesn't even carry heavy duty grounded timers anymore.  I would recommend this timer to anyone!,negative,,

I noticed another reviewer had the same problem so I'm here to buy another brand.UPDATE: After i wrote the above I took the unit and kept spinning the dial to loosen it up.I plugged it back in & found it WOULD now turn on but not OFF. So i repeated spinning the dial over & over & finally, now it's working properly.",negative,,
"I have used these timers since February (now April) on a daily basis. Sometimes the little mechanical/plastic tabs do not turn the lights on or off. It misses about once per week. If you need your timer to reliably work, order a digital timer that is not mechanically based.",negative,,

"The red and green plastic tabs that control the on-off timing are interesting targets for my toddler. Unfortunately, then, not only is my kid playing with an electrical outlet, but I've lost the red and green tabs critical for the function of this device.

"Next generation pressure cooker, has a button to tell you if it is pressurized, it pops up, when it goes down, it is safe to open, meat falls apart in as little as 15 min for chicken 20 mins for pork and beef, i guess 15 lbs pressure is the setting, doesn't say, but much faster than my older mirro cooker.",negative,,
Used this food press for making jelly and to prevent seeds and other impurities when canning strawberry jam and jelly.,negative,,
"Other reviewers see the same problem as mine.The lower handle has little to hold it on. The single bolt that came with the pot is too small and won't hold on. We were forced into using a 32 thread 1/4"" hex bolt. It held for a year. Now the handle has fallen off, again. Is the bolt the problem? No, it's the threaded receptacle! MAYBE, if I drill out the receiving threaded shank and try to force a 32 thread #10 bolt in.If This doesn't work, I'm avoiding buying another Presto from China.When the pot worked, it did well. A little hard to get the aluminium grooves to hit the slots without a fight.Nope, this cooker is useless. Presto you stink.",negative,,
"I have read several comments about loose screws on the handles.  Go to your local auto parts store and ask for &#34;Loc-Tight&#34;.

"I'd used my old pressure cooker for over 20 years. The Teflon coating was chipping off, and because of safety concerns, I was happy to receive another pressure cooker as a gift. That cooker (the Casa Essentials 5-quart model) only lasted for a few uses. The silicone seal ring lost its ability to form a seal, and the part cost almost as much as the cooker. I decided to upgrade and bought the Presto 4-quart cooker.Within a few uses, the handle became loose, because the screws that hold it on are too small. Every time I use the cooker, I tighten the handle. Next, the safety seal in the lid started seating improperly and allowing steam to escape. So as the pot heats up, I tap on the safety seal to seat it properly.Today when I tapped, the safety seal fell down into the chicken soup, which began spraying out of the hole and all over the kitchen. Not a pleasant event on a morning when I felt a bit under the weather and was looking forward to a bowl of chicken soup for lunch.I fished out the rubber seal and put the soup in a conventional pan to finish cooking. Because of the problem with the handles, I'm not going to replace the seal. I will discard the pan and either buy a good quality pressure cooker or do without one.",negative,,
"We have tried Beef, Poultry, and Pork in various different vegatables in the cooker and have not had a failure once. The stainles version is the only way to go.",negative,,
"I had purchased a Kuhn-Rikon cooker but it finally failed. I bought this one from Amazon and it works great for one reason: It cannot fail. The old fashioned jiggler weight is fail-proof. Cookers with springs and valves will fail over time-the heat and pressure do damage.My little weight became crusty with water salts, so I bought a new one. No problem.",negative,,
"I use this to cook mostly my meal consisting of a vegetable & fish mixture.  It works well.  I use 1/2 cup of distilled water (which in my opinion is the bare minimum).  You must always start by adding at least a 1/2 cup of water before adding any vegetables.  My veggies & fish cook in about 2-1/2 to 3 minutes, after which i run cold water over the cooker to cool it down.  The only problem i have had is getting the lid to go on sometimes.  I think it gives me problems if the black rubber gasket inside the lid is not positioned correctly, then it is impossible to get the lid on, probably because the cooker is new to me and needs to be &#34;broken in&#34; a little, especially the lid gasket.  If you have a problem with  the lid not shutting closed, then try rotating the black gasket a little or maybe remove it and turn it over on it's other side.  But these pressure cookers are really good, you can cook some really healthy food quickly in them.",negative,,
"Been using pressure cookers for years - grew up on a farm - pressure cookers abundant.Needed to replace the 30+ year old Mirro aluminum one.Still have my aluminum 2 1/2 qt Mirro but wanted a bigger one.So I bought this one to try. Cookers are all basically the same.HOWEVER -----I wish SOMEone would have posted SOMEwhere that this product is- wait for it - - -MADE IN CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA CHINA!Oh I get it - if we are told it is not USA made, we will look elsewhere.What a rip! I am so very disappointed that we cannot purchase something made in the USA anymore.Thanks to all our government officials by helping every one on this planet but our own people.We cannot even buy a cooking pot for cripes sake!Let's see if in another 30 years I still have this CHINESE pot.For cryin' out loud.......................  :o(",negative,,
Pressure cooker by Presto that is not the quality of my older one. I will use but would not purchase again. Stainless Steel very thin.,negative,,
"I decided to get rid of my old aluminum pressure cooker due to concerns about cooking in aluminum. This one is way nicer, once I figured out the gizmos.",negative,,
I bought this as a replacement for my 40 year old pressure cooker. This one is stainless steel and has a heavy bottom to prevent sticking. It cooked a chicken in about 20 min. plus heat up and cool down time. It is very simple to use and also inexpensive. I would recommmend this product.,negative,,
I have a onion allergy so being in control of what goes into my sauces helps me a ton and this little baby gets me into beef stock chicken stock and spaghetti sauces very fast and allergy friendly.The included user guide tells you some basics but pretty much any recipe can be converted to use a pressure cooker and saves a ton of time.,negative,,

"High quality pressure cooker.  This pressure cooker is made of heavy gauge steel, and you immediately feel the quality over the cheaper ones.  My wife uses it to make Beef Stew, and pork chops, and everything comes out tender and juicy, with no burning.",negative,,
"Sadly returning this.  The handles won't stay tight and the screws that hold them are already rusting. Plus hard to get it up to pressure - too much sputtering around the handle for a long time!  I remember my Mother cooking delicious tender meats in her pressure cooker years ago.  But I did not have good results with this one. Followed directions and chicken came out tough.  And - a magnet won't stick to the interior (only the exterior)...so maybe the interior is not stainless steel, but aluminum..which is not what I want to cook my food in. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy.",negative,,
"I have used pressure cookers for over twenty years, and this is adaquate. the six quart size comes from the height and not the diamater of the bottom. The worst thing about it is that you have to attatch the handle to the lid. It's hard to do and it loosens every time you use it so your constantly tightening it. I wish it had been factory assembled instead of my having to assemble it . I don't have the hand strength go do it right.",negative,,
You can only fill 2/3 of this 4 quart pressure cooker so you cannot really do any canning unless using very teeny tiny jars and cooking very small portion of food.  I have a 5 quart pressure cook and you cannot put a whole chicken in it. You need at least a 6 to 8 quart cooker to cook a decent meal with meat and vegetables.  I won't recommend buying this pot even if it is cheap.,negative,,
"I've used a 6-qt. aluminum pressure cooker for years.  It finally bit the dust so I decided to try a stainless steel cooker.  This one is taller, but not as wide, as my previous cooker.  However, it is plenty big to hold a 3-4 pound chicken or roast, which is what I usually cook in it.  So far I really like it - and no problems yet with hardware rusting like I've read in a few reviews.  I would recommend this one to anyone who needs a not-too-big pressure cooker!",negative,,

The Hosa XLR cables are affordable and very heavily made.I have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere.I decided to purchase shorter cables and the Hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly.You really will not be disappointed with these.,negative,,
"I didn't expect this cable to be so thin. It's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable I've used. Not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference. If I had the foresight I'd spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable.  Still, it works and was inexpensive.EDIT: 6 months later and it's dead already.  Wire frayed at the right angle jack.

"These cables have taken a beating the last few months, and have served me well with no problems..Real metal ends, not molded on, with high quality silicone jackets and strain reliefs at the connectors..",negative,,
"One end was loose, so I tightened it, it keeps coming loose so I had to put a dab of crazy glue on the threads, hope I don't ever have to open the end for repair.",negative,,
Only complaint is the size which is my fault. If you can buy at least a 15 foot if you plan to use it on stage.,negative,,

This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire.",negative,,
Another quality product from Hosa.  Just what I needed for an insert patch from my mixer to EQ.  I always like slightly longer length as I can always zip tie back but hard to stretch!  No noise from this cable!,negative,,

Handy for rehearsals when the band needs to listen to a track while working out an arrangement (my bass cab is full range fEARful 15/6/1). Before picking this up, I used a couple of cables / adapters to go from stereo 1/8&#34;  to mono 1/4&#34; and it often seemed I never had quite what I needed on hand.",negative,,

These cables are a little thin compared to hosa and GLS. They picked up a little interference from other equipment as well. Guessing they are lacking some shielding.,negative,,

I bought this as a present for my daughter to learn guitar on. She absolutely loves it. Everyone that has played on it over the past few weeks loves it. You can't beat this for the price!!!,negative,,
"I know, I know, many people hate on this pedal, calling it &#34;stale&#34;, and &#34;generic&#34;. The problem that they have is that they simply haven't found the right settings on the pedal and the amp, because, after all, the settings on both the amp, and the pedal do make a difference. One thing to note is that it is a bit on the quiet side in my opinion. I have a Digitech Bad Monkey, and I set the level on that to 2 so it matches up with the amp. With this pedal, I have to crank the level to make the clean tone the same level as the distorted tone.",negative,,
"This is a standard on my peral board along witht he Blues Driver.  This little yellow box is the most bang for your buck you are going to find in an Over Drive pedal.  It is tough, sounds like fire, and will serve you well.  For $50 there is seriously no better deal.",negative,,

"I've only been playing ukulele for about 3 years, so I'm new to using a capo.  It seems to hold tight.",negative,,
"You can never go wrong buying a Kyser capo.  They are made to last and really do what they are designed to do.  The great thing about this capo is that it fits both my banjo and mandolin so I don't have to have a seperate capo for each.I also have a capo for guitar made by Kyser and I can tell you that works just as well.  You can never go wrong with a Kyser.  Not only that I like the idea that it's an US company.  I've had some cheaper capos and they just don't do the job.  They either don't press down on the strings hard enough or they wear out too quickly if they get used much.  This Kyser will last a long, long time.",negative,,
"So I bought these because being Dunlop, I trust the brand. I dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky. The only problem I have is, they scare the piss out of me. Its not a ""tighten washer and nut"" situation with what ive normally seen on strap locks. These have pegs that insert. Its so hard for me to trust these, I always have 1 hand gripped firmly on guitar even if just adjusting the amp I clench my guitar. So scared that the little metal balls things will just slip, peg fall out and ruin a $500 guitar. I havnet had a single problem with this system yet, and I never hope that I do. But if it happens there will be an update to this. Good product so far, just wouldn't recommend it. There is too much crap in the world to be worried about, strap locks shouldnt be one of those things.",negative,,
"The screws are too long for my very thin bodied Gibson SG Classic.  I can not find shorter screws which fall into the pin so that the straplock will work either---the heads are all too large.I believe I used these on my Gibson Les Paul Custom years ago, and they worked perfectly.  Not on my newer SG though--at least with the new screws it comes with.Fender Start appears to take the system well--only time will tell.",negative,,
"Straplocks have been around for a long time, but now You can use the instrument with a regular strap as well, This dual design sold me on it..Easy to install on the guitar. A little difficult getting the lock mechanism installed on the strap, still only took about ten minutes to do.  The added security of knowing your 1200 dollar bass isn't going to hit the floor makes it very well worth the small cost of this item..",negative,,
"I like these straplocks, but they were a little tight to get on a Levy's strap.  I did manage to get it on.  However, I found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar.",negative,,
"My bass had original-equipment Dunlops on it, but they were silver-tone, whereas all my other hardware is gold.  And after 30 years, they looked kind of dirty and tarnished.  So, I knew it was time for a new gold set, and I couldn't be happier with their look and quality.  I have used that other S-brand on other instruments, and really prefer the Dunlops.",negative,,
"I don't know if this is a common problem, but i have these on both of my basses, and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing, like metal does before it rusts, it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing. The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose, and one time (the first time) i didn't notice and it actually fell out. Notice i still like the product, this was just one of those things i think, so I would still recommend it.",negative,,
"I'm not very familiar with how pop filters actually work, apart from getting rid of unnecessary peaks when recording. I have noticed an improvement in recording quality with this pop filter on. I don't know how it compares to other pop filters though, but this one seems like it works for me.",negative,,
Don't even hesitate buying this thing. It's everything you need. It's a pop filter. It clamps on to anything that isn't over about an inch and a half in thickness.It gets the job done. Buy it.,negative,,
"the thing is that they don't seem to stay! i mean, you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic &#34;arm&#34;, but it doesn't stay where you put it. and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality. but, i think if you're lucky if just might get the job done.",negative,,
I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed).,negative,,
"wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless, the screen came out, was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is MUCH better...avoid this!!",negative,,
"I ordered this product to use for personal recording, and thought...what could possibly go wrong? I ordered it ""New,"" and it definitely shows signs that it not new. First, the package was stapled, that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. Then, to make matters worse, there is a hole in one side of the fabric. When I order something new, I expect it to be new. Based on this product alone, I would not recommend buying from this seller.",negative,,
What my headline says. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Removes those annoying popping P's out of your recordings. Until you can afford a Sennheiser condenser microphone that has a built in pop filter than you're going to need this. And the price was right too.,negative,,
"It is a fun little practice amp, and I agree with the praise it gets. The positives have been covered so I'll point out a few (minor) things I don't like.First of all the power button is on the back, which is annoying. The rest of the controls are on top, why do I have to grope around the back to find the most important button. Plus I keep it in a cabinet so I have to pull it out to turn it on and off.Next! I wish they'd just name the settings &#34;clean&#34;, &#34;overdrive&#34;, &#34;distortion&#34;, and so on. JC Clean, Black Panel, Brit combo and R-Fier mean nothing to me.Then there's another minor annoyance that the input is recessed. A 90 degree angle plug won't fit unless you run it around the back.Lastly, the amp is solid and rugged but that means it's heavy. Not heavy like I can't pick it up, just heavy for something called a micro amp.None of these are deal breakers, just things I find annoying. Overall I have to say I prefer my VOX mini 3.",negative,,
This houses your guitar and I have a couple humidipaks  in there because I live in a northern desert. Not many frills to this bag. It does the job.,negative,,
"This bag fits my Epiphone Les Paul II electric guitar very well...but no room to spare.  The outside pocket is too small for sheet music, but works for small things like a tuner and short cable.  I prefer a bigger pocket, but aside from that I can't complain.  This gig bag looks really sharp, and has two shoulder straps for convenient carrying.",negative,,
"This gigbag is a very tight fit for my Epiphone Les Paul. Their is minimal padding, so it is little more than a dust cover. I tossed it aside, and bought a Fender gigbag. The Fender is heavily padded, and gives me some serious protection.",negative,,
"I'm using them to angle my speakers up in addition to isolating them from the desk surface. Unfortunately, these angle the speakers down by default, so I had to do some cutting and rearranging, but it worked out. If you need to cut these to fit your speakers, try to find something better than scissors, because it's quite hard to cut the foam evenly with them.",negative,,
"They work as well as any Dunlop pick; they don't crack, which is a big plus if you use the general Fender variety.  I go a little thicker than I would for regular plastic picks, because they get flimsy after a while.  Take note of the price of the picks and the shipping cost - it might be cheaper for you just to go to your nearest music store.",negative,,
"If you thought a pick is a pick (like I once did long ago) you would probably come to realize that it would be a mistake to assume that position as your playing and playing strength increases in attack and/or complexity.I use the Dunlop Tortex 1.14mm Purples.Early on in my playing I was using thin to medium picks but read in a guitar magazine along with hearing from several friends that a heavy pick is better. Why? After messing about I found that the player is able to fully control the pick and not let the pick interfere with input and attack.  The interference with a thin or medium pick is that it has give, or slackens when attacking hard. With a heavy gauge pick that lack of rigidity or slack is only introduced by the player and not through the picks flexibility.I tried it and liked it and have been using heavy gauge picks since the mid '80's.I like the Dunlops feel, grip, and durability. They hold up for a very long time. How long? I have had some last a few years. They are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durability.My students use them too, I don't demand it, but I do stress the control aspects with picks of different gauges.Highly recommended. You won't be disappointed.",negative,,
I don't seem to drop these at all as compared to other picks I have used in the past that just seemed to slip....,negative,,
"I absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks! They are so grippy, I haven't broken a single one yet, they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio, so it's hard to loose them, but I still do. If you have like a child, nephew, niece, sibling, or parent that plays guitar or bass you can't go wrong with getting these for them, or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little Fender picks that break if you strum a chord, and if you are lucky enough not to break them, they just slip out of your hands while you're playing. They are a little thin for rhythm playing however, and I recommend the .88 mm picks for that.",negative,,
my favorite picks. Can't go wrong with tortex. the only habit I have with picks if just chewing on them and destroying them so I have to buy like a ton of them,negative,,
"cant go wrong with Dunlop pick, they last and don't break. end up losing them verses breaking. This .38 mm is a bit soft for my liking, will go a size thicker next time~",negative,,
"yes, i think you should try these.  if you're looking at them, then get them.  they are thin and flexible so i purchased them to develop my pick skills as i was a finger type guy w/o any pick experience.  i don't drop these and get a feel for where the sting is located w/o looking.",negative,,
"i like these kind of picks because they have some grip to them, normal picks i use slip out of my fingers some times but these dont.if you hate droping your pick while playing,get these.",negative,,
"I use the 1.5 mm Dunlop Gator Grip for twenty years. The non-slip surface doesn't take long to wear off, but I have a work-around. I've even put them in a vice, and filed new points on them. I prefer an extra heavy pick because there's no delay from pick deflection.",negative,,
"Looking for picks for bass , this one did not work for me, it is thick and hard, good attack.but only thumb picks work, so i can use my fingers too.",negative,,
"If you're worried that the 3.0 mm is too big for your guitar, you're probably right.If you don't use a pick for your bass, then you don't want this either.But if you want to pick your bass, this is the plectrum for you!",negative,,
another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase.,negative,,
"Using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks. You simply play faster, no matter what level you are. Alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flat-pick drag. Now I only use flat picks for acoustic play when I want to hear the crunch. 24 picks in a pack, is an insane bargain. You pay twice as much in a store.",negative,,
"I recently bought a few packs of Jazz IIIs and I was shocked.  They don't play at all like what I was expecting.  Under high magnification the edge doesn't look the same as the old Jazz III either, and they don't play the same if you turn them over!!!  What's up with that?I'm sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like Dunlop.  Let's hope this is just a short-term fluke.",negative,,
I like Dunlop products I used the purple tortex 1.14mm almost exclusively until I met up with this Jazz III.  And now my personal debate continues...  I like a thick pick and this Jazz III is.  I like tortex and this isn't but...I really like the orange color which makes it easy to locate if you drop it.  I rarely and I do mean rarely drop a tortex pick but this nylon might get a bit slick at times.They make 3 or 4 picks in this line with varying degrees of tip pointiness.  I like the pointy model the others have round and rounder tips.This is the new and improved jazz style pick and I am still trying to figure out if I like this or the trad Fender jazz pick.  Or perhaps having a few slightly different picks laying around isn't such a bad idea after all.,negative,,
"I like Fender Mediums, always have, but, I gotta branch out man.  Not sure about these picks yet.  The feel a little more stiff my usual.  I want them to last longer.  What happened to the days when you carried the same pick around in your pocket for months and played it until it was round?",negative,,
"I put it on the boom of my mic stand. Tight on some, not on others. I need to put a shim on it for some stands to keep the picks in place.",negative,,
it does what it says it does.  only complaint is that sponge is very small and in very dry areas it needs to be checked and refilled 2 times a week.,negative,,
"No spill, no mess. This is one of the easiest to use products for cleaning strings and necks. Just use the fast fret and wipe off with a rag. It will not dry out, and lasts for years. The only thing I don't like is the can will not fit in accessory area of my guitar case and the led has sharp edges, so put it down before using the cleaner.",negative,,
This stuff will lube up your strings pretty well! The only downside is that it leaves tiny pieces of fuzz on my strings after a few times of use- but it comes with a little cloth that I assume is meant for this little inconvenience.,negative,,
"This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name, but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret, my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too...",negative,,
"Seems to work well, though I don't know how long it's supposed to last. I have sweaty hands, and when I'm done I wipe my guitar down with this lil guy and it helps a lot to keep the strings from getting dirty or cruddy.",negative,,
"The tips of my fingers often get pretty dry and cracked, especially when I've been playing a lot.  The problem, at least for me, is that pieces of the dead skins sometimes catch on guitar strings making slides, bends, and pull-offs less fluid.  A few strokes of GHS makes the fretboard give me a much smoother playing experience.  An alternative would be using Vaseline on my fingers, but that would probably be terrible for my fretboard.  Also, I sometimes use an Emory board to smooth my fingertips which helps, but I'd rather do that as little as possible to keep callouses strong.  GHS allows me to minimize that.",negative,,
